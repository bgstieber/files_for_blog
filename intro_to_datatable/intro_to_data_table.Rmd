Although the primary data wrangling package I use is [__`tidyverse`__](https://www.tidyverse.org/), it's worthwhile to explore other packages that do similar data manipulations. The closest "competitor" to the [__`tidyverse`__](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is the [__`data.table`__](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/) package. 

![Data Wrangling](https://media.giphy.com/media/wRKeX8o1eIxxu/giphy.gif)

Three of the main selling points for using [__`data.table`__](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/) are that it's 

- Fast
    + [`fread`](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/reference/fread.html) and [`fwrite`](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/reference/fwrite.html) should be a part of any data scientist's data file management toolbox 
- Concise
    + We'll go through a few examples using the [__`data.table`__](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/) syntax
- Efficient
    + Works well with large data

These are three qualities we look for in data manipulation.

If you're frustrated by how verbose data manipulation chains can get using [__`tidyverse`__](https://www.tidyverse.org/) packages, [__`data.table`__](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/) might be right for you.

Here are the packages we'll need for this post.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
library(data.table)
library(nycflights13)
library(microbenchmark)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
options(datatable.print.topn = 2)
```


The data set we'll be working with in this post comes from the [__`nycflights13`__](https://cran.r-project.org/package=nycflights13) package. It shows on-time data for all flights that departed NYC in 2013.

```{r}
(flights_dt <- as.data.table(flights)) # convert to a data.table
```

```{r}
paste(dim(flights_dt), c("rows", "columns"))
```


## Demo

### The basics

If you're familiar with `SQL`, `data.table` syntax should make a good amount of sense. The syntax allows you to do a lot more than the common operations we expect with a base `data.frame`. Here is the general form of `data.table` syntax:

```{r eval = FALSE}
DT[i, j, by]
```

- `i`: where (subset) / order by (sort)
- `j`: select (grab certain columns) / update (add/modify columns)
- `by`: group by

To demonstrate, let's take a look at each of these components.

#### Subset and sort with `i`

```{r}
# flights departing in January
flights_dt[month == 1]
# flights departing on March 10th
flights_dt[month == 3 & day == 10]
# flights where the total delay (dep_delay + arr_delay) is 10 minutes or more,
# the destination was Dallas (DFW) and was in January, February, or March
flights_dt[(dep_delay + arr_delay) >= 10 & dest == "DFW" & month <= 3]
```

We can also sort using `i`:

```{r}
# sort by total delay
flights_dt[order(dep_delay + arr_delay, decreasing = T)]
```

#### Select and create new columns using `j`

This first example shows how to select a column. It looks very similar to what we'd do in base R. 

```{r}
# get flight destination
destination <- flights_dt[, dest]
head(destination)
```

You'll notice that the result of the previous operation was a vector. Sometimes this is what we want, other times it's not. So, how can we select a column and have a `data.table` returned instead of a vector?

We can use `.(column_I_want, another_column_I_want)` or `list(this_column_too, and_this_one_also)`.

```{r}
# use .(columns_to_select) or list(columns_to_select)
# .(columns_to_select) acts as "shorthand" for list(columns_to_select)
flights_dt[,.(dest)]
# we can select multiple columns using .()
flights_dt[,.(year, month, day, origin, dest)]
# rename columns
flights_dt[,.(Origin = origin, Destination = dest)]
```

We can create columns using `:=`:

```{r}
# create total delay column
flights_dt[,total_delay := arr_delay + dep_delay]
```

One major difference between "standard" operations in R and some operations in `data.table` is that `data.table` will make [__modifications in place__](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-reference-semantics.html#section-2), meaning we don't have to use the assignment operator (`<-` or `=`).

<br>
<br>

If we expect `flights_dt`, we can confirm that the `total_delay` column was added.

```{r}
flights_dt
# remove that column
flights_dt[,total_delay:=NULL] 
flights_dt
# add multiple columns
flights_dt[, `:=`(date = lubridate::ymd(paste(year, month, day, sep = "-")),
                  log_distance = log(distance),
                  air_time_in_hours = air_time / 60)]
flights_dt
```

#### Grouping with `by`

In the first two examples, we use `.N`, which is a [special symbol](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/reference/special-symbols.html) which allows us to count rows in our data. `.SD`, which is used later on in this post, is also a special symbol in __`data.table`__.

A simple example, counting by origin of flight.

```{r}
flights_dt[,.N,origin]
```

A little more complicated, counting by origin and destination, then sorting to show most frequent, then slice top 10 rows.

```{r}
flights_dt[,.N, .(origin, dest)][order(-N)][1:10]
```

To wrap up this section, let's show the median and average total delay by origin and destination airport, and then sort by average total delay. We also add in `.N`, because it's always good to show the sample size.

```{r}
flights_dt[!is.na(arr_delay) & !is.na(dep_delay),
           .(avg_delay = mean(arr_delay + dep_delay),
             median_delay = median(arr_delay + dep_delay),
             .N),
           .(origin, dest)
           ][order(-avg_delay)]
```

### A little more advanced

![Turning it up](https://media.giphy.com/media/5MGFEJS7FIxK8/giphy.gif)

We often want to perform multiple operations on a single `data.frame`. If we keep all of the code to perform these operations on a single line, our scripts can become illegible and unwieldy. Similar to how __`tidyverse`__ pipes might span multiple lines:

```{r eval=FALSE}
data %>%
  mutate(new_columns) %>%
  group_by(grouping_columns) %>%
  summarise(other_columns) %>%
  arrange(desc(some_column))
```

We can "chain" __`data.table`__ expressions:

```{r eval = FALSE}
DT[ ...
   ][ ...
     ][ ...
       ]
```

This example gets the cumulative total delay over the course of a year by origin airport. It utilizes filtering, sorting, and grouping.

```{r}
# get cumulative delay by origin airport
# uses "chaining"
cumulative_delay_by_origin <-
  flights_dt[!is.na(dep_delay) & !is.na(arr_delay) # keep valid flights
             ][order(time_hour),                   # sort by date 
               .(time_hour,                        # select date and cumsum delay
                 cumu_delay=cumsum(arr_delay+dep_delay)), 
               origin]                             # group by origin airport

ggplot(cumulative_delay_by_origin,
       aes(time_hour, cumu_delay/60, colour = origin))+
  geom_line()+
  theme_bw()+
  xlab("Date") + ylab("Cumulative total delay (hours)")
```

Let's get even crazier with chaining.

The next example finds the "biggest loser" on each day (i.e. which flight had the worst total delay). We then count up (using the `ones` column) which origin airport the biggest loser was departing from. We calculate this cumulatively over the course of the year.

```{r}
top_delay <- flights_dt[!is.na(arr_delay) & !is.na(dep_delay)
                        ][,`:=`(total_delay=arr_delay+dep_delay, ones=1)
                          ][, .SD[ which.max(total_delay) ], date
                            ][order(date)
                              ][,.(cumu_obs = cumsum(ones), date),.(origin)]

ggplot(top_delay, aes(date, cumu_obs, colour = origin))+
  geom_line()+
  theme_bw()+
  xlab("Date")+
  ylab("Cumulative # of Days with Worst Delay")
```


### Performance evaluation: base __`R`__, __`tidyverse`__, and __`data.table`__

Let's demonstrate a typical calculation you might do in R: an aggregation of two columns based on grouping by three columns. In this specific example, we're calculating the average departure delay and average arrival delay by origin airport, destination airport, and month of flight.

```{r cache = TRUE}
set.seed(1848)
benchmark_data <- microbenchmark(
  # base R solution
  base_R = aggregate(list(flights$dep_delay, flights$arr_delay),
                     list(flights$origin, flights$dest, flights$month),
                     mean, na.rm = TRUE),
  # tidyverse solution
  tidy_verse = flights %>% 
    group_by(origin, dest, month) %>% 
    summarise_at(c("dep_delay", "arr_delay"), mean, na.rm = TRUE),
  
  #data.table
  data_table = flights_dt[,lapply(.SD, mean, na.rm = TRUE), 
                          .(origin, dest, month), 
                          .SDcols = c("dep_delay", "arr_delay")],
  
  times = 100)

```

```{r message=FALSE}
library(ggridges)
benchmark_data_dt <- as.data.table(benchmark_data)
benchmark_data_dt[,time_in_ms := time / 1000000]

ggplot(benchmark_data_dt, aes(x = time_in_ms, y = expr))+
  geom_density_ridges2(rel_min_height = 0.01, scale = 1.5, fill = "#c5050c")+
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.25)+
  theme_bw()+
  scale_x_log10("Time (milliseconds, log10)")+
  scale_y_discrete("Operation",
                   labels = c("base_R" = "Base R",
                              "tidy_verse" = "tidyverse",
                              "data_table" = "data.table"))+
  ggtitle("Grouped Aggregation Timing Summary")
```

Here is how much slower the median operation is compared to `data.table`. Since this _is_ a tutorial about __`data.table`__, we use its [`dcast`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-reshape.html) function to convert long data to wide.

```{r}
dcast(benchmark_data_dt, 
      .~expr, 
      value.var = "time_in_ms", 
      fun = median)[, round(.SD/data_table,1), 
                    .SDcols = c("base_R", "tidy_verse", "data_table")]
```

## Summary

I hope this was a gentle introduction to the [__`data.table`__](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/) package. I think the key to getting off on the right foot with this package is understanding the syntax.

The syntax allows you to do a lot more than the common operations we expect with a base `data.frame`. Here is the general form of __`data.table`__ syntax:

```{r eval = FALSE}
DT[i, j, by]
```

- `i`: where (subset) / order by (sort)
- `j`: select (grab certain columns) / update (add/modify columns)
- `by`: group by

## Fun fact

Fun `R` fact: `<-` and `=` are actually functions, and can be called like so:

```{r}
`<-`(x, 1:5)
x
`=`(x, 5:1)
x
`<-`(x, c(rev(x), x))
x
`<-`("ill-advised variable name", 1:3)
`ill-advised variable name`
```
