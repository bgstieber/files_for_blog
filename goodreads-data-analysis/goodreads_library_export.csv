Don’t read the rest of this review if you’re uninterested in some of my political thoughts. <br/><br/>This book made it clear how uninformed I am of Wisconsin’s history (including its recent history). There a lots of things to be proud of in Wisconsin’s past: progressivism, protection of workers’ rights, and a commitment to environmental decency.<br/><br/>This book also supports a recent revelation (recent to me): politicians like Walker and Trump are not so much a disease, but instead symptoms of a system that seems to be fundamentally broken. Walker’s ideas were neither new nor original, but that doesn’t change how destructive they have been. It might make you feel a little better to know the state wasn’t duped by his own Ideas, or it might make you feel worse to have a better understanding on how much influence outside groups and money had on the state. <br/><br/>This book did not make me more hopeful.
