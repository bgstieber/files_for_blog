Sure, I ate the fish, and I'll tell you what I thought about it, but I was distracted and didn't really invest in it. That said, I still think what I have to say is accurate albeit maybe not as thorough as usual. Here's the back story - I was contacted by an editor from The Dish (the UW foodie magazine) to see if I'd be interested in talking about the Madison Fish Fry scene and whatnot. I agreed to do so only if we could do it at the Big 10 over a plate of fish and she wholeheartedly concurred. We met on a Wednesday (since the Big 10 has fish on Wednesdays) to sit down and chew the fat.For starters the Wednesday Fish Fry selection at the Big 10 pales in comparison to the expansive Friday menu. It's whittled down to perch and cod, and since I had my mind on freshwater fish I went the perch route (she the cod). Every other time I've had perch at the Big 10 it has been 5 fillets of the real deal yellow lake perch, but this time was different. This $12 plate had 3 fillets which were definitely not the genuine article in look or in taste. This fish was flaky and light, but had almost no flavor whatsoever whether it be in the fish or the breading. It's only saving grace was the revamped Big 10 tartar that clung to its coating and screamed ""I'm the zing you need!"" It was disappointing to say the least but not nearly as disappointing as......the fact there are no potato pancakes on Wednesday either. We had to settle for shoestring style fries, which to their credit, were perfectly acceptable, but not trademark side we were longing for. Whereas the PPs were absent the soft marble rye still showed up as did their homemade slaw which was regrettably forgettable under these circumstances. Clearly being distracted by gabbing about other fish is going to take some focus away from this review, but I still got to gauge the Wednesday Fish Fry at the Big 10 and it's just not the same. The fish was different, the sides were a shadow of themselves, and the whole experience just wasn't what you find on a Friday. Overall, we don't recommend this Wednesday Fish Fry, but HIGHLY recommend the FRIDAY FISH FRY at the Big 10. It's a night and day difference and something we're definitely happy we found out. For those who are interested, the interview with Daniella from The Dish is scheduled to appear in the Spring edition of the print and on-line magazines. It should be a good one!

It can't have decent food, can it? Let's go somewhere else."" To these people I say ""Just give the Fish Fry a chance. Trust me."" The Big 10 has a big time Fish Fry, and it's the best near campus, and maybe downtown, period.For a ""college bar"" the Big 10 makes a pretty plate. Whether you go for the walleye (it comes two different ways), the cod, the perch, or the bluegill it will look like it was prepared with love (and it is). Today my eight bluegill fillets varied in size from: look-at-this-cute-little-bugger to whoa-look-at-this-monster!  Regardless of the discrepancy in girth each had the flavor you want and the light crisp breading you expect. A little seasoning in the mix lets you know it's there without burying the fish. It is simply excellent stuff and worthy of every bit of praise we've bestowed upon it. The Big 10 does mostly all the fish, and unlike many places does mostly all the sides, including potato pancakes! Sure, the shoestring-style fries are great, and sweet potato fries do the job, but the potato pancakes (which are all too rare in Madison) are where it's at. These are thicker than their Milwaukee-style counterparts and come with some homemade apple compote (which is essentially a fancy apple sauce with big chunks of apple and a cinnamon-y sweetness). When you add it all up they make for a side that no other place in Madison can match and while we'd personally love a little more onion in there and crispier edges, those are small fleas on a big dog. These are killer. I used to decry the tartar at the Big 10, but over time they have clearly seen the folly of their ways and made necessary changes. The sauce of today has evolved into a thick and creamy blend with a spectacular flavor. It completely complements the fish instead of fighting against it for attention. It's a 180 of the highest caliber and one that has endeared them to us (and hopefully all of Madison). Rounding out this Big Fish Fry is a big soft roll and a slaw with plenty of horseradish sprinkled in. Both do their part and are both a step above what 90% of places trot out there. Some people just don't want to believe that a ""dumpy little college bar"" can make a Fish Fry as great as their favorite supper club, but the Big 10 is here to prove them wrong. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and have no qualms about heaping more kudos upon it than we already have. Hell, I'm ready to go back for another round right now!  http://jordansbig10pub.squarespace.com1330 Regent StreetMadison, WI 53715     (608) 251-6375",2586,0.19936813186813188,0.4765628815628815

Sure, there are a few other places to get your fill, but none of them really come close to the authenticity the Big 10 offers. Most of the other spots have cod and fries, but thats about it. The Big 10 has that and so much more; from bluegill to lake perch, to walleye to potato pancakes, they really do Fish Fry right. Today was a bluegill and potato pancakes day and the well-run kitchen had our platters ready in 10 minutes or so. The modern looking rectangular plate was piled high with seven fillets - a couple of which were real honkers. Each one was a tasty little nugget of joy featuring flaky meat and the Big 10s as advertised light breading. The resulting flavor combo is divine despite the fact that the breading could have used another dash of salt or maybe same garlic powder. Still, it was top-notch stuff. Weve always been fans of the Big 10s potato pancakes especially as they are some of the only youll find in the city. They are on the thick side as far as latkes go but are cooked up just right so there is still some crispiness around the perimeter. They house a really great flavor especially when paired with the homemade apple compote. A very unique and diverse tartar puts a perfect finishing touch on the fish with a hint of pimiento, and a just enough dill. Historically, the Big 10 was way too into the dill, but the percentage has been dialed way back recently which makes for a much more balanced blend. An incredibly firm white roll plays the part of the starch and is certainly not your grandmas dinner roll. It is dense and hearty but inexplicably dry, and while it is unique, I wouldnt say its any better than the norm. The creamy slaw is a little better than average though, with a potent horseradish blast that really keeps you coming back for more. While a lot of places on campus pay lip service to Fish Fry the Big 10 takes the Wisconsin tradition very seriously. The result is a Fish Fry that can go toe-to-toe with any in town, and proves that even academics love their fish. Overall, we highly recommend the bluegill at the Big 10 and look forward to our next rendezvous. http://jordansbig10pub.squarespace.com1330 Regent StreetMadison, WI 53715     (608) 251-6375",2413,0.16744109623015874,0.4221453373015873

This is especially true for those of us who were fortunate enough to attend the greatest university in all the land, and take the fond memories of college days with us. There are so many places to go, things to do, and beers to drink that it can take a full four years (and in some cases five or six) to get it all in. There is also no shortage of delicious food available at the campus-adjacent eateries, and with so many ways to fill your head you know there are plenty of ways to fill your belly too. When youre talking Fish Fry, the filling station of note is the Big 10.We had a couple prospective students staying with us for the weekend and we figured what better way to acquaint them with the Alma Mater than a stop on Regent. We showed up around 7 oclock, which is usually a risky proposition, but the Big 10 is a big place, and we had no problem rustling up a table for four. One of the many waitresses found us immediately, and sped off to grab us some drinks. By the time she got back with the beverages we were ready to order, and while they all went for non-fish items (theyll learn) I put in for the bluegill. Unlike the drinks, the fish arrived lickety-split, and was steaming hot. My fancy rectangular plate featured seven fish fillets riding on top of two of the Big 10s homemade potato pancakes, a cup of slaw, a cup of tartar, a crusty dinner roll, and a dish of apple compote for the pancakes. As you probably guessed, I wasted little time digging in. At first bite I could tell this was the classic Big 10 bluegill. The fillets varied in size from small to large with each coated in a light breading that features a smooth flavor, and an appropriate amount of seasoning. The fish itself was flaky and tender, with no rubbery textures or any overpowering flavors. Once a few of the fillets were eaten I was able to get at the potato pancakes and was happy with what I unearthed. The latkes were on the thick side (at least for potato pancakes), but were diverse and flavorful. Their onion-y undertone paired well with the cinnamon-rich, homemade compote, and added a welcome component to the Fish Fry. Adding even more diversity to the dinner plate was the Big 10s homemade tartar. While the sauce used to be a dilly disaster, it has smartened up over the years. The current rendition pairs nicely with freshwater fish, although its on the thin side and doesnt cling like Id like it to. Rounding out the plate was a spherical dinner roll, and some of the Big 10s homemade coleslaw. The roll was a little too dense for my tastes, but with a bunch of butter it became manageable. The finely-chopped slaw on the other hand was good from the get-go and put the finishing touch on what is definitely a Grade A Fish Fry. While the UW is a special place, the allure of the Fish Fry doesnt seem to resonate with the student community like it should (it certainly didnt strike a chord with our applicants-to-be). Fortunately for them there is plenty of time to learn the ropes, and there are places like the Big 10 to help them along the way. Overall, we highly recommend the bluegill at the Big 10, and are glad they are passing their wisdom on. I know Ill take a plate of their knowledge any day.

Its a given that their tiny parking lot will be packed. Its a given that there will be sports on the many TVs. Its a given that there will be a ton of different fish to choose from on Fridays. Its a given that the wait staff will be buzzing all over filling orders, and be happy to do it. But mostly, its a given that people will be eating delicious food and be having a great time doing it. This is Badger country. This is Friday. This is how they do it at the Big 10.From my outpost at the bar I could see it all  the fish, the folks, the frying, and of course the beer. My $12.50 order of lake perch arrived just over five minutes after the waitress put my order in and looked simply amazing. While there were only three perch fillets, they were very large and very in charge. They ruled the rectangular platter with their visible seasoning and artfully curled edges. The pretty perch were punctuated perfectly with plenty of pepper and satisfactory sums of salt. The fish itself was even pretty when exposed, featuring a few tiny bones to go with the delicate meat. It was really tasty, but not necessarily plentiful I wouldve liked at least one more fillet. The fish were perched atop a pile of potato pancakes, and alongside the Big 10s homemade apple compote. The cakes were on the small side, but had a mellow, inviting flavor. While Id like to see a hint more onion in the mix, they were still really tasty. The accompanying compote was loaded with cinnamon and big apple chunks. While the viscous goo was hot and hospitable, it wasnt great with the pancakes since it was so spicy. However, it was a nice little dessert and welcome addition to the Fry. Ive never touted the Big 10 tartar and since its the same old recipe Im not going to start now. While it does seem that the dill has diminished over time there is still all sorts of stuff in it, but luckily most of them are benign. The fish is tasty with or without the sauce so you can simply take it or leave it. The bread at the Big 10 is in a constant state of flux, and this time it was a crusty little round rendition. While Id say it was step up from a plain old dinner roll it wasnt necessarily a big one. The finely-chopped coleslaw, on the other hand, was leaps and bounds above the mean and was finished off with a lovely horseradish pop. For all the givens at the Big 10, the most important one is this: they have a great Fish Fry. Overall, we highly recommend the lake perch, and have no doubt its the best youre going to find in the campus area. They do a great job sticking to what has traditionally made the Fish Fry so great while adding their own modern flair. While this aint your grandmas Fish Fry, she would probably like it just as much as you do. http://jordansbig10pub.squarespace.com1330 Regent StreetMadison, WI 53715     (608) 251-6375",2889,0.2382823129251701,0.5179724111866969
http://madisonfishfry.com/reviews.php?restaurant=1,http://madisonfishfry.com/reviews.php?restaurant=1&event=794,2013-03-29,Jordan's Big 10 Pub,"Overall, I would highly recommend this Fish Fry.",Excellent,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Good,"Judging a book by its cover can be dangerous. Judging a Fish Fry by its bar is even more dangerous. There are a lot of great Fish Frys hiding in places that you might not expect, and if you hold a preconceived notion of an establishment you might just be missing out on something special. This is exactly what happened to our friend Holly. Although Holly attended UW, shed only been to the Big 10 for football games. Needless to say, the atmosphere of a game day Saturday is a little bit different than every other day at Jordans joint. On normal days the chaos and jubilation of game day is replaced by real tables, a calming atmosphere, and quietly excellent food. It really is a good book, one worth reading. We rolled in to the Big 10 during the Michigan/Kansas game in the Sweet 16. Despite it being almost 9pm the place was plenty busy, but we somehow got a table with no problem. Our waitress-in-training came right over and had a round of drinks for us in no time  the Big 10 wait staff (whether in training or not) doesnt mess around. As we sipped our drinks, Michigan closed the gap, and just as our food showed up Trey Burke hit a deep 3 to send the game to OT. It was a miraculous shot, and signaled great things to come.  My bluegill platter was loaded with four of the small swimmers, and looked just amazing. The eight frail fillets were lightly breaded and seasoned just enough to take the edge off, but still let the bulk of the bluegill flavor through. It was incredibly tasty, and easily some of the best available in town. Holly picked the perch so I also got to try some of it as well. Peculiarly, while the B1G has always had real yellow perch in the past, something seemed off this Friday. These fillets were massive, and while they still showed the characteristic lake perch skin through the breading, they just seemed to too meaty to be yellow perch. Holly guessed they were ocean perch, but they didnt taste quite that fishy to me, and I presume the Big 10 would never stoop to those tricks.  I think it might have been Pike-Perch or one of the other species commonly associated with lake perch by distributors, but that is purely speculation. Regardless of the species, it was still tasty, but larger and flakier than anticipated, and just not quite right. My bluegill bungalow was lovingly built on a sturdy foundation of homemade potato pancakes. The concrete cakes were exceptional, with their only shortcoming being a lack of mortar (the homemade apple compote was sold out). While I gladly would have paid the extra buck and a quarter for the gooey goodness, it wasnt a total loss since the potato derivatives are delicious with or without it. The cakes were a little starchy, a little oniony, but massively delicious. The B1G tartar was also a triumph as the dill-doused blend of yesteryear is but a distant memory. While the latest thick and creamy incarnation still has a few random ingredients and a bit of dill, its just enough to perk it up, without weighing it down. The slaw was also great, and as finely chopped as is seemingly possible. The creamy concoction had a nice consistency and a little horsey-kick which kept it interesting. Weve become accustomed to the pump-rye roll at the Big 10, but this time we received a full-fledged half-slice of thick-cut marble-rye. It was soft and stanky, and paired perfectly with the coleslaw. Even though Hollys perch wasnt exactly what she was expecting she was still blown away at how nice everything at the Big 10 Pub actually was. She had only known it as a Badger Bar, and never considered it could be anything but. In reality, the Big 10 is much more than just a great place to watch the Badgers. It is a Fish Fry destination, and one of the best downtown Madison has to over.

When given the option, I tend to lean towards lake fish over ocean fish for a couple of reasons - 1) the limited availability of our freshwater friends, and 2) I think they just flat-out taste better. Of course, none of that matters when you show up on a Wednesday night when the only fish on special is cod. The Wednesday night special at the Big 10 consists of two long pieces of cod, your choice of potato, a cup of coleslaw, half a slice of rye bread, and a cup of tartar (basically the whole shebang) for $9.00. We had our food in practically no time which was no small feat since they were plenty busy for the Wisconsin/Florida basketball game. I started in on the fish and was a little surprised at just how good it was. The fillets were thin, but flaky and paired with a surprisingly light beer batter. The fish and batter blended well, and the coating didnt overpower fish in ay way. It was a very solid rendition of beer battered cod, and I think ol Gabe would be impressed. The fish rode on a bed shoestring-style fries that were plentiful, but lukewarm at best. Normally, I would have chosen the potato pancakes, but since it was Wednesday there was no mention of them. While the portion was generous, they werent hot and crispy which resulted in them being so-so rather than oh-so-good. A black Solo cup wielded a small, but adequate, amount of the Big 10s homemade tartar sauce. The allotment wasnt abundant, but lasted until the end since it had enough relish that it didnt need to be applied liberally. It really perked up the cod and left me wanting more. The thickly-cut rye bread also left me wanting more since it was only a half-slice. It paired really well with the zesty, finely-chopped coleslaw and had me really wondering where the remaining 50% went to. When youre talking Wednesday night Fish Frys you have to limit your expectations to some degree. Most places dont go full-bore since Fish Frys are a lot of work. The fact that the Big 10 even offers cod on Wednesdays is commendable and since Id probably never get it on Friday it was a good way to force myself into trying it. Overall, I highly recommend all the fish at the Big 10 and the cod is no exception. http://jordansbig10pub.squarespace.com1330 Regent StreetMadison, WI 53715     (608) 251-6375",2374,0.17089682539682538,0.42975661375661384

While I originally thought it was over-hyped (and over-dilled) they have made some subtle changes over the years that have really made me stand up and take notice. Essentially, theyve cut all the loose ends and are offering the best example of a comprehensive Fish Fry downtown Madison has to offer.  What do I mean when I say comprehensive? I mean they do all the major fish varieties (cod, lake perch, bluegill, and walleye), and most importantly, do them all well. They also feature potato pancakes which are very traditional but also very hard to find outside of the Milwaukee area. Since they offer so many kinds of tasty fish I always have a hard time choosing one, but usually settle on the perch or the bluegill. This time I landed on blue. In addition to dropping the dill from the tartar, the Big 10 has altered other parts of their Fish Fry. It all starts on the ground floor with some fancy new rectangular dinner plates  ooo la la. The quaint quadrilaterals are gracefully decorated with an abundance of fish, a couple of the cakes, a hearty dinner roll, and ramekins of: tartar, apple sauce, sour cream, and coleslaw. With such a masterpiece painted atop the one in front of me I almost couldnt bring myself to destroy it. My belly had other ideas... I started in on the fish and was wowed. It was likely the best fish I've had at the Big 10 to date and some of the better bluegill Ive had anywhere. The eight fillets were small (as you might expect expect), but were flaky and moist with just a hint of elasticity (as you should also expect). The fillets were home to a light and crumbly breading that had a good amount of seasoning for just the right balance. The spice worked well with the airy fish enhancing its subtle flavors to just the right extent. Quite Remarkable.Under the pile of sunfish hid a couple near-prefect potato pancakes. Like the bluegill, the PPs were well-seasoned and expertly fried. They were joined by what appeared to be a homemade applesauce that had big chunks of fruit in it. The cinnamon laden sauce topped the pancakes perfectly and added a luster that plain cakes didnt have. The applesauce was an amazing addition to the pancakes, and the duo was well worth the extra buck and a quarter they cost. I used to loathe the Big 10s tartar sauce since it was dominated by dill, and had all sorts of random stuff in it that threw the flavor off. The blend still has all kinds of items in it, but most are benign enough to let the mayo zest shine through, and whats more, the dill has been diminished to the point where it is unnoticeable. Touchdown Wisconsin! Rounding out this most impressive of Fish Frys was a beefy bun and some superb slaw. The baseball-sized roll was hearty and ample. The crusty loaf was dense as can be and ate like a meal. The slaw pranced along playfully behind radical roll, and was simply marvelous. It was a shining example of a finely-chopped mix that is perfectly zesty and incredibly satisfying. Talk about upping the ante The Big 10 just went all-in. It didnt happen overnight but they have morphed into something really great, and our representing the Fish Fry tradition admirably in a place where not many people expect to find it. Overall, I highly recommend this Fish Fry and have no problem calling it the best downtown Madison has to offer.  http://jordansbig10pub.squarespace.com1330 Regent StreetMadison, WI 53715     (608) 251-6375",3489,0.19715710518989207,0.49078985222427846

Yes, you heard right, the one-time skeptic has turned a full one-eighty, and is wholeheartedly endorsing the Big 10 Pub. What could they possibly have done to pull off such a feat, you ask? Well, it isnt all about tartar sauce, but thats a good place to start.We have always loved the fact that they Big 10 does all the major fish varieties, and does each one well. From piles of perch, to boatloads of bluegill, the Big 10 has a level of Fish Fry mastery that is rarely witnessed. While the fish at Jordans joint has always hit the mark, their subpar sauce was enough to send us elsewhere to get our Friday fix. Im happy to report that a changing of the guard has officially taken place.Matt, Reese and I rolled in to the Regent Street staple around noon and grabbed one of the open booths along the near wall. Our waiter came over once he saw us, and ran to grab us some drinks right away. When he came back two plates of perch and one of bluegill were ordered, all with potato pancakes as the side. He sped away again leaving us to talk about the previous evenings NFL Draft and ponder what the Vikings were thinking with their first round pick. Needless to say, we shared a few laughs at the dreadful franchises expense.The fish was ready in no time flat and sat in front of us in pristine condition. My bluegill looked larger than average, but I wasnt about to bitch about big fillets. As soon as I dug in I realized something was amiss  the fish tasted very good, but didnt have the bluegill allure. As I glanced around I quickly realized Reese accidentally got my plate, and I, his. We swapped fish posthaste and I took what remained of the bluegill fillets to task. The sun shone brightly on its namesake fish, bathing the critters in deliciousness. In comparison to the perch the bluegill was firmer, but still nice and flaky. Both were sheathed in the same light breading which had a pleasant flavor, but could have used a bit more salt. The perch was good as well, but slightly mushier than the bluegill. While the perch probably had a little better flavor, its texture was worse which leveled the playing field somewhat. By and large, both were good, but I would say the bluegill came out slightly ahead in this head-2-head fish-off.The Big 10 is well known as one of few places in the Mad City offering potato pancakes with their Fish Fry. In my experience the unique potato products have been hit and miss - always good, but rarely great. Today was a major exception, as the fancy spuds were perfectly fried and absolutely delicious. The crisp edges played off the supple interiors well, and were taken over the top by the chunky apple sauce that accompanied the divine dish.The homemade slaw that joined the melee was finely chopped, creamy, and right on the money; while the white roll was non-traditional with a very crusty crust, doughy middle. It was a nice departure from the old standby prepackaged roll, but made me wonder where their once proud rye escaped to?The fish at the Big 10 has always scored highly with us, but their dilly tartar was enough to put a damper on it. The recent revamp in tartar town has so greatly improved this Fish Fry that the whole shebang has been bumped into highly recommendable territory. The new sauce is much more mayo-y, with a generous allotment of relish, and a severe reduction in dill. It now compliments the fish rather than overwhelming it, which is exactly what we are looking for. Overall, we highly recommend both the bluegill and the lake perch at the Big 10. The fish is great, the potato pancakes are a welcome change of pace, and we really appreciate their new take on tartar.

Yes, you heard right, the one-time skeptic has turned a full one-eighty, and is wholeheartedly endorsing the Big 10 Pub. What could they possibly have done to pull off such a feat, you ask? Well, it isnt all about tartar sauce, but thats a good place to start.We have always loved the fact that they Big 10 does all the major fish varieties, and does each one well. From piles of perch, to boatloads of bluegill, the Big 10 has a level of Fish Fry mastery that is rarely witnessed. While the fish at Jordans joint has always hit the mark, their subpar sauce was enough to send us elsewhere to get our Friday fix. Im happy to report that a changing of the guard has officially taken place.Matt, Reese and I rolled in to the Regent Street staple around noon and grabbed one of the open booths along the near wall. Our waiter came over once he saw us, and ran to grab us some drinks right away. When he came back two plates of perch and one of bluegill were ordered, all with potato pancakes as the side. He sped away again leaving us to talk about the previous evenings NFL Draft and ponder what the Vikings were thinking with their first round pick. Needless to say, we shared a few laughs at the dreadful franchises expense.The fish was ready in no time flat and sat in front of us in pristine condition. My bluegill looked larger than average, but I wasnt about to bitch about big fillets. As soon as I dug in I realized something was amiss  the fish tasted very good, but didnt have the bluegill allure. As I glanced around I quickly realized Reese accidentally got my plate, and I, his. We swapped fish posthaste and I took what remained of the bluegill fillets to task. The sun shone brightly on its namesake fish, bathing the critters in deliciousness. In comparison to the perch the bluegill was firmer, but still nice and flaky. Both were sheathed in the same light breading which had a pleasant flavor, but could have used a bit more salt. The perch was good as well, but slightly mushier than the bluegill. While the perch probably had a little better flavor, its texture was worse which leveled the playing field somewhat. By and large, both were good, but I would say the bluegill came out slightly ahead in this head-2-head fish-off.The Big 10 is well known as one of few places in the Mad City offering potato pancakes with their Fish Fry. In my experience the unique potato products have been hit and miss - always good, but rarely great. Today was a major exception, as the fancy spuds were perfectly fried and absolutely delicious. The crisp edges played off the supple interiors well, and were taken over the top by the chunky apple sauce that accompanied the divine dish.The homemade slaw that joined the melee was finely chopped, creamy, and right on the money; while the white roll was non-traditional with a very crusty crust, doughy middle. It was a nice departure from the old standby prepackaged roll, but made me wonder where their once proud rye escaped to?The fish at the Big 10 has always scored highly with us, but their dilly tartar was enough to put a damper on it. The recent revamp in tartar town has so greatly improved this Fish Fry that the whole shebang has been bumped into highly recommendable territory. The new sauce is much more mayo-y, with a generous allotment of relish, and a severe reduction in dill. It now compliments the fish rather than overwhelming it, which is exactly what we are looking for. Overall, we highly recommend both the bluegill and the lake perch at the Big 10. The fish is great, the potato pancakes are a welcome change of pace, and we really appreciate their new take on tartar. For around $10 you are treated to a full-on Fish Fry complete with all the trimmings which is a a heck of a deal, but can be more than most people expect to eat at lunchtime. When you belly up to the Big 10 be sure to bring your love of freshwater fish and a big appetite because this is one Fish Fry that goes all out regardless of the time of day.

http://madisonfishfry.com/reviews.php?restaurant=1,http://madisonfishfry.com/reviews.php?restaurant=1&event=567,2011-02-25,Jordan's Big 10 Pub,"Overall, I would highly recommend this Fish Fry.",Good,Excellent,Good,Good,Good,"There was a time when we werent big fans of the Big 10. There were a few reasons for our distaste, but it mainly focused on their tartar sauce which had to be some of the most dill laden we have ever eaten. This shoddy sauce made it easy for us to choose other options as we knew that all other things being equal at least their tartar would be better than that of the Big 10. Well, as time goes by people change, and apparently Fish Frys can do the same. Enter a new era at the Big 10. I was rolling solo this particular Friday and chose the Big 10 on a whim. Truth be told, I was planning on pilfering a plate of walleye at Wandos, but thanks to the state wrestling tournament, downtown was more clogged than the pores of the youngsters competing in said grapplefest. Realizing that parking was going to be at a premium, I got out of there as quickly as humanly possible and made my way to the far end of Regent Street where I stumbled upon the Big 10 Pub. Since it was just me, I grabbed an open stool at the bar and threw my pitch to the bartender as soon as she stepped to the plate. In typical Big 10 fashion I barely had the opportunity to get a sip off my drink before the fish was up. My $10.75 plate was well appointed with eight small bluegill fillets (with one perch mistakenly mixed in), two potato pancakes, generous cups of tartar, coleslaw AND applesauce, and a nice little round roll. I went for the bluegill and tartar first and foremost and was instantly stunned. The surprise wasnt due so much to the fish, but more to the splendid sauce that transformed it.  While the lightly breaded bluegill was flaky and moist, it didnt have a lot of taste on its own. Thankfully, the sauce stepped in and took over, which was nice as it wasnt capable of picking up the slack the past. This creamy butterfly broke loose from its dilly cocoon, and emerged anew as a beautiful blend of thick mayo, zesty relish and finely chopped pepper. It was easily a tenfold improvement over its predecessor and I actually used every single drop. Traditionally the Big 10 has hung its hat on their homemade potato pancakes due to the fact that most places in the Madison area dont even offer classic cakes. It is always kind of a treat to get your hands on them, and today was no exception. The twins could barely be seen as they peeked out ever so slyly from beneath its bluegill blanket, but I did what was necessary to uncover and crack into them while they were still piping hot. The precious pancakes sported a delicious crispy crust around the edges and emitted a heavenly golden hue. They were joined by an ample cup of applesauce (apple chunks is more like it), and while they werent onion-y at all, the sweet and salty blend of potato and apple complimented the fish well. The little round bun that rolled along was not your standard fare, but had a nice crust which was a little firm, but not hard. The slaw also moved beyond the norm as the homemade, creamy cabbage concoction was finely chopped, and had some serious zest. Both roll and slaw were above average and added a nice change of pace to their fried counterparts. The Big 10 has made us big believers. We always knew the Fish Fry was good, but the tartar was usually a deal breaker. Well, they have turned a corner in our book and with such a great lineup it might be tough for the pack to keep up. We will have to return soon to ensure this tartar transformation wasnt a fluke, but if it is what we experienced this visit I will have no problem highly recommending this Fish Fry from here on out. The Big 10 has always been good enough to walk the line, but as of today they are finally runnin with the big dogs. http://jordansbig10pub.squarespace.com1330 Regent StreetMadison, WI 53715     (608) 251-6375",3780,0.14423944797571173,0.4787882264255891

It is a slow torture, but when you are meeting a friend at a Fish Fry it is something you have to endure from time to time. I happened to be on campus and decided that it was an appropriate time to give the Big 10 Pub another go-round. When Jer said he would meet me there around 1pm I was hesitant, but agreed to wait until the end of the lunch hour to eat. I showed up just before one, grabbed a stool at the bar, and began the waiting game. Now, Jer is not usually one to keep a man in limbo when Fish Fry is on the line, but for various reasons (reportedly attractive young ladies, not the least among them) he was delayed on this day. As I sat at the bar I witnessed plateful after plateful of delicious looking Fish Fry pass me by. Eventually Jer called and said he was running late and just to order him some fish. Since the Big 10 has a wide variety of options I relayed them to him as best I could and he eventually settled on the same thing I was getting: perch and pancakes. He moseyed in the door several minutes later and had a mountain of perch before him shortly after.The $10 Mountain consisted of 8-10 pieces of lake perch piled atop a couple of homemade potato pancakes. I was actually hoping to try the bluegill since I had the perch on my most recent trip, but it sold out right before I was about to order it. Doh! Waiting for my friend cost me that one... However, it was no big deal since the perch is still a great choice. The perch that comprised my mountain was good and very consistent from piece to piece.  Jer was less enthusiastic as a few of his pieces had some extra salt which really turned him on, but made those that were less spicy, less desirable. Overall, the fillets were fairly well sized and more than plentiful, especially for only ten bucks. The actual fish was light, as was the batter which clung to the perch for dear life. I personally like the batter to fall right off my perch, but this stuff is certainly nothing to scoff at.At the Big 10 it is almost a prerequisite that in lieu of French fries you get the potato pancakes. This isnt because they are the best potato pancakes per se, but more so, that they are hard to come by, and when you have the opportunity to order them, you need to take it. These pancakes were darkened to a crispy brown and tasted good, but not spectacular. I have come to expect PPs to have a nice oniony kind of taste, but at the Big 10 they dont really. By and large, they are still pretty good, especially when coupled with the abundant chunky applesauce.Initially I ragged on the Big 10 a little bit due to the fact that they tartar was a straight up dilly mess. They have changed things up a bit, but I cant say it is a vast improvement. It is certainly better, but still has all sorts of odd stuff it ranging from sweet (and I mean sweet) relish to red pepper chunks, and of course, a good amount of dill. It is alright, but like the finely chopped slaw, I could take it or leave it.For some reason the bread decided not to show up this visit. While we received a pat of butter, the bread which was to accompany it was nowhere to be found. When I inquired as to where it was the bartender told us it should have been there and offered to grab us one of the wheat buns, but by that point our fish was gone and our bellies were full so we just told him to save it. It wasnt a huge loss and I will still give them credit since it was supposed to be there, but I shouldnt really need to ask for it, right? Cest la vie. Overall, I think this Fish Fry is easily recommendable if for no other reason than the portion is gigundo. A ton of perch, two nice sized potato pancakes and enough tarter to cover the works. Obviously, had the bread been there the score would be higher, but even without it I was still stuffed. To top it off, the service was really good and the bartenders and waitresses clearly care about their customers satisfaction. This is not a revolving door of college kids wait staff, and it shows. The Big 10 has made big leaps in our book. Next time, hopefully, there will be less waiting, and more bluegill. http://jordansbig10pub.squarespace.com1330 Regent StreetMadison, WI 53715     (608) 251-6375",4410,0.18573308270676683,0.44125939849624063

Let’s just say it wasn’t the nicest thing I have ever read. Apparently they were not overly thrilled with my previous reviews of their Fish Fry. They seem to be quite proud of it and somewhat appalled that I would suggest it was anything less than exemplary. On both of the previous trips I was accompanied by a fairly large group and thought maybe if I went solo I would be able to really focus and pick up the subtle nuances that have other people saying this is the best Fish Fry in Madison. After this, my third trip, I can feel 100% confident that this is indeed a good Fish Fry, but not the best in Madison.There are a lot of great things about this Fish Fry, and the Big 10 in general. The bar is very clean and modern and the wait staff seemed to be very well coordinated and friendly. The variety of fish served on Fridays is also impressive. From Beer Battered Cod, to Lake Perch, Bluegill, Walleye or the catch of the day, there is something for everyone. The Big 10 has certainly covered all their bases. The only problem with having this many options is it is hard to know which is the best. I ruled out the Walleye because it is grilled instead of fried. I don’t really count grilled fish as part of a “Fish Fry”. There is nothing wrong with serving up two delicious sounding walleye dishes, but it is not fried fish. After a short debate with myself I chose the $10 lightly breaded Lake Perch over the equally enticing, and also lightly breaded, Bluegill.Since I was one of the first people to order my food was up alarmingly fast. The plate was piled high with upwards of 10 Perch filets and an absolute mountain of French fries. Normally I would get the potato pancakes because they are kind of a rarity and very good but I wanted to see what their fries were like (if you have never been here before and go for a FF make sure to try the potato pancakes first). The French fries were skin on, straight cut and also of the highest quality. The Perch filets were average sized and tasted good. They were not the most flavorful I have had, but fairly tasty and definitely plentiful. I think a good tartar sauce could have put it over the top.The tartar sauce that comes with the fish is okay, but not my style at all. It is incredibly dilly and thin and just does not taste great. It really does nothing to compliment the fish which is a shame. If you are a big fan of the dilly sauce, this may be exact what you are looking for, but it just isn’t for me. The bread served with their Fish Fry is generous sized rye roll, which I find gross but give them credit for since it is very traditional. Their finely chopped coleslaw was also okay but didn’t really keep me coming back for more, no big loss.The Big 10 serves up a fine Fish Fry. Is it the best in Madison? I would say no. Is it a nice place to get a good Fish Fry for a good price? You bet. This is an incredible value. For $10 I got so much food I could not even finish it all. They definitely have a few groups of regulars who come in for Fish Fry every Friday and you can see why, great variety (something for everyone), generous portions and fair prices. Overall this is an easy Fish Fry to recommend, please just don’t tell me it is “the best”.http://jordansbig10pub.squarespace.com1330 Regent StreetMadison, WI 53715     (608) 251-6375",3360,0.3047375541125541,0.48714646464646466

It is disappointing to go to a place where you remember the fish being great and have it not be. This was the case this particular Friday unfortunately. We had been to Rex’s Innkeeper in Waunakee once before and had a great time so I assumed this time would be no different. We arrived and got our name on the list then headed to the bar to grab a drink. A few minutes later our name was called and we headed to the table. Friday nights the Innkeeper has cod and haddock on special which sounds great because those are two high quality fish choices. I went for the haddock and my friend went for the cod.

It is disappointing to go to a place where you remember the fish being great and have it not be. This was the case this particular Friday unfortunately. We had been to Rex’s Innkeeper in Waunakee once before and had a great time so I assumed this time would be no different. We arrived and got our name on the list then headed to the bar to grab a drink. A few minutes later our name was called and we headed to the table. Friday nights the Innkeeper has cod and haddock on special which sounds great because those are two high quality fish choices. I went for the haddock and my friend went for the cod.

Obviously, it is right next to Camp Randall so it is a big time destination on Saturdays, but I have always found it to be much more enjoyable during the other days of the week when it is not so crowded. I have participated in their volleyball leagues and enjoyed the company of friends (AKA drinking beer) there more than once. Being a Wisconsin tavern they do have the requisite Fish Fry on Friday and since we hadnt been there for a while I figured it would be a good day to pay them another visit. Gabe agreed. We arrived sometime around noon, grabbed a couple stools at the bar and sat back to watch the high speed chase on Fox News while we waited for the bartender to come over. With all the TVs and alcohol paraphernalia on the walls I had a hell of a time finding the specials listed anywhere and it wasnt until after the bartender brought some menus that Gabe finally pointed it out to me. The only fish related special on the board today was the Perch Plate for $7.95 so we ordered two and refocused our attention on the TVs.We watched the silver Ford F-150 evade the Texas Po-Po for about 10 minutes before the lake perch was placed in front of us. The 4 large pieces were nice and hot and had a bubbly looking batter which was a little strange but still tasted pretty good. It was quite firm and crisp but not really as flaky as I like it to be. The fish itself was fine but could have been better as it also wasnt as light and flaky as I like. Overall it was pretty decent, but much like the driving skill of the officers in the chase, left a little something to de desired.The tartar was also not great and didnt really do anything to help the fish. While a good tartar could have boosted the overall experience, this stuff tasted a little too sweet and almost tasted like a mass produced variety. Thankfully the skin-on French fries were very good and deflected some of the attention from the sub par tartar. As the chase continued we saw more than one cop attempt to pit the truck, and fail miserably. It was almost as ugly as the slaw which accompanied the Fish Fry and left just as bad of a taste in your mouth. Luckily for the Stadium they saved face by offering up two large wedges of rye bread which I really liked even though I am not a huge fan of rye.While we finished our lunch the chase dragged out to what seemed like no end. Unlike the Texas State Patrol, the Stadium did an excellent job of sealing the deal by offering up a warm chocolate chip cookie which could have easily been homemade. Since the rest of food was so-so it helped to put this Fish Fry into the recommendable strata for me especially when coupled with the quick service and fun atmosphere of the Stadium. The chase continued as we exited the bar leaving us to wonder if it was all worth the $50 in gasoline the guy had stolen. It didnt really seem to add up. Luckily for us the Fish Fry at the stadium did. Alone, no single element was outstanding, but when put together the whole was greater than the sum of its parts. Overall I would say this is a good Fish Fry for lunch feel alright about recommending it. www.stadiumbar.com1419 Monroe StreetMadison, WI 53705     (608) 256-2544",3217,0.18555014430014433,0.5190692640692641

Despite the fact we had a trio of children with us, we braved the VF, and everyone, I mean EVERYONE, was thrilled (especially me).VFW Post 8483 is the one just north of the airport (with the plane on a stick) and they offer what is bar-none the best Veterans-affiliated Fish Fry in the area. You can take that to the bank! Their Friday menu has all the usual suspects, and all at Veteran-friendly prices...we're talking $12 (REAL) lake perch here, people. This wasn't my first rodeo with the Vets, and despite being tempted by the price point and the perch and that of the wonderfully-cheap walleye, I stuck with the even cheaper $10 cod since I knew it was the real sleeper of the bunch. Despite the fact you only get two chunks of fish they are HUUUUUUUUUUUGE! Like, misleadingly large. This plateful is easily more than enough for one big man and the chunks come skinned in a light, ultra-seasoned breading that makes the flaky flakes a lot more than just cod. It's honestly some of the absolutely tastiest cod out there, and I say that with no hesitation. Everything that accompanies the fish is just sort of average, starting with the straight-up-straight-cut fries. The thick and creamy food service tartar keeps pace, with grandma's dinner roll and a food service slaw finishing things off as they should. It's really hard to justify going anywhere else on Fridays when the VF on CV is like five minutes from home, but sometimes you just do what you gotta do regardless of how silly that may be. Of course, when you go afield, and realize there was 10x better fish just minutes from your door (with NO WAIT mind you) you do tend to feel like an idiot. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and think it's definitely one of Madison's more overlooked and under-appreciated Frys.737 County Road CVMadison, WI 53704     (608) 241-3740",2083,0.11731566820276497,0.4854109062980031

We waited far too long before coming back and unjustifiably so - that's a mistake we won't make again.The Friday specials at the VF are the same as they've always been with a couple small exceptions. They still feature the cod and walleye they always did, but have added lake perch and shrimp to repertoire. All are relatively cheap ranging from $10-$13.50. Since I'd had walleye for lunch I settled on the lake perch and got the cod for the little man so got to sample that as well. The cod was every bit as good as I remembered it being and then some. The massive chunks were probably a good 6 oz each. If you could somehow manage to pick them up and swing them like a bat you could kill a rodent or maybe even a small dog. Of course, you couldn't do that since the loins are so moist and flaky they would fall apart on the back-swing, but you get the gist. Each is covered in a thin yet crunchy coating that will get soaked with grease if it sits for too long...so get crackin'! The breading has lots of flavor just as we remembered which really takes the cod a step beyond the norm. The lake perch was also great and had a similar light breading. While a couple were a little off (overly fishy, almost like they'd been sitting around a while) they were all the genuine article which for $12 is a little surprising. 5 BIG fillets made up the portion and while they weren't so big that they raised a doubt about their legitimacy they were jumbos. There are a few sides to choose from and take it from the wedges are the way to go. These plumpers had some extra seasoning and while the regular version had a big battered crunch the wedges won the day. In truth, both are winners and you can't make a bad choice between them. The supper club style tartar that comes along is as thick as all get out and a real clinger, while the dinner roll is basic, but at least it's there. A creamy slaw also toes the line, but isn't the puncher you'll find at some other establishments. Like the roll it does it's job and little else. With so many places to get fish on Friday (and more popping up every day) it is hard to go to all of them more or less revisit places you've been before, but VFW Post 8483 deserved better.

During good economic times the most popular places are often packed to the gills (no pun intended), and the mere mention of their name becomes synonymous with long waits. The Avenue Bar, Tobys Supper Club, and VFW Post 8483 are the kind of places that carry this measuring stick with pride, and clue the rest of us into just how bad (or good) the fiscal situation is. If this past Friday is any indication, the situation is getting dire, and times are tough in the Badger State.We had a hearty crew of four Fish Fry devotees this week, and since there wasnt a vegetarian to be found, we set our sights on one of Madisons classic Fish Frys at the Northside VFW. Upon pulling into the lot around 6:30 it was immediately apparent that the crummy economy was at work, and we would have no trouble finding our fix this evening. We strode right into the dining side of the VF and gave our orders to the geriatric gem who awaited our arrival. Everyone in our party went for the fried cod ($8.50), with three out of the four adding an additional piece for $2. We took our laminated Cod card and ambled over to the bar to grab a few cheap beers before dinner ($1.75 for a mug of MGD is none too shabby). As soon as we had our drinks we picked one of the many available tables, and waited for the server to swing by, which she did a few moments later. She grabbed our cards, queried us as to our potato preferences, and zipped off to the kitchen (zipped may be a bit generous, but she was moving as fast as is probably advisable). We killed the 10 minutes or so that followed by downing our beers, and BSing with some friendly members of the Ladies Auxiliary. Our plates were not overflowing when they arrived, but were amply stocked with: fish, fries, tartar, baked beans, and slaw; while a basket of rolls also appeared after a tiny bit of prodding. The pieces of cod were larger than average and tasted great, as we expected they would. The flaky white fish was blessed with a spicy cornmeal style breading that was very light, and complimented the smooth cod well. For a brief moment I thought the fish was going to get greasy, but for whatever reason the tiny bit that developed seemed to vanish into thin air. I quickly destroyed the standard 2-piece, and was very thankful I had the foresight to get that extra piece ahead of time. When the choice was given for crinkle fries, wedge fries, or baked potato, my brain must have been out to lunch because I didnt even give it a second thought, and went for the standard crinkles with no hesitation. As soon as my small portion was delivered I immediately had buyers remorse. While the Sysco-standard fries were a little undercooked and uninspired, the wedges were thick-cut, well-seasoned, and much tastier. Jer reveled in his wedge-wise decision, but was gracious enough to allow us a taste at least. Pairing perfectly with the cod was a small, but adequate cup of homemade-looking tartar. This savory sauce was right on the money as the thick mayo base was accompanied by an ideal amount of dill relish. The coleslaw stole a page from this book as its creamy base, and zesty horseradish-kick fit right in. In the end, both sauce and slaw did what they needed to do, and added their own special touches to the meal. The baked beans were also a bonus, and tasted like they were fresh from the Bushs can.  The rolls were your standard packaged dinner numbers and nothing special, but at least they were extant, and I give them credit for that since so many places seem to be cutting this corner in 2010.  Overall, this is Fish Fry is easy to recommend. The fish was excellent, as was the near-perfect tartar sauce. The crinkle fries didnt necessarily add much to the meal, although the wedges certainly would have. When you tack on some tasty slaw and a regular roll, the standard 2-piece becomes a good value for only $8.50. As we scraped up our last bits of tartar, we became fully aware how just few people were at the VF this Friday. We assumed a classic Fish Fry like this would reach their average week in and week out, but according to our waitress they werent even close tonight. Clearly, Fish Fry isnt a top priority with the holidays approaching and people spending more scrupulously than ever. It is too bad really, but I guess its just a sign of the times.737 County Road CVMadison, WI 53704     (608) 241-3740",4484,0.1184006598894239,0.4664796065357864

Apparently in larger towns (like Madison) the same rules apply. I had heard good things about the North Side VFW on Highway CV (the one near the airport with the plane on a stick) but had never actual taken the opportunity to try their Fish Fry. After this last Friday I am definitely glad I made the effort. The VF on CV looks like your typical VFW. From the outside it is a boxy looking block building but has a great view as you look to the North. There is not a very descript entrance but picking either one of the two doors on the rear side of the building will get you in. The inside of the place is definitely a VFW, wood paneling, bar style tables and chairs and of course lists of members written on the black felt boards with the little white press in letters. This is what great Fish Fry is all about! Immediately upon entering you are greeted by a lovely young lady who is collecting the money for Friday specials. Your only options here are fried goods my friend, so don’t come a knockin’ if you are lookin’ for any foo foo crap. The options are written on a piece of notebook paper sitting on the table. Cod - $7.50, Walleye - $10.00, Poormans - $7.50 and Shrimp for some dollar value that I didn’t even consider looking at. There was no real choice involved for me, for $7.50 the cod was a must. After I paid I took my little card that said cod and headed to one of the many ‘family-style’ tables with my friends. We sat down for a split second then hit the bar to get our 24oz mugs of tap beer for $1.50. That is a great deal even if there were only 6 beers to choose from. The service was not super fast but when the fish was served it was well worth however long we did wait. The batter on the cod was very flavorful, almost like a KFC style blend of herbs and spices. It was very tasty. The cod itself also seemed to be very high quality. Served as two good sized fillets, the fish was flaky and tender, while not being mushy; truly superb. I could have easily eaten a third piece and was hoping some of fellow diners would be less hungry, but I think everyone was able to polish theirs off. The taste of the fish carried over into the French fries somewhat as they were also well seasoned and a little salty. The slaw and bread we got before the fish came out was also quite good. The bread was a standard dinner roll but very edible. The slaw, while it looked kind of nasty was actually pretty tasty, and had a hint of horseradish that really gave it a kick. The tartar was also good, but served in a tiny cup that had me scraping the bottom near the end. They also served you a nice little tub of baked beans with the Fish Fry, yum.One of our co-diners ordered the walleye with wedge fries which were also very good. The walleye seemed to enjoy the same batter as the cod which is a little weird but both tasted great so I think it was a wise move. Cheap beer, tasty Fish Fry and good friends, you can’t ask for much more than that on any given Friday. If you can handle eating dinner with an older crowd hit up the North Side VFW sometime. The atmosphere is exactly what you should expect at a VF and the food was delicious. If you love Fish Fry this is one you have gotta try. 737 County Road CVMadison, WI 53704     (608) 241-3740",3465,0.20416591591591587,0.4871066066066068

It's no longer a ""traditional Irish pub,"" it ""feels cold,"" and on and on. While I can agree it doesn't have the typical Irish pub aesthetic, I can't say it bothers me all that much. I actually like modern lines, the clean feel, and most importantly, I like that they're not trying to pawn off fish-n-chips as a traditional Wisconsin Fish Fry. Too many Irish pubs do that...While it's no longer f-n-c's the Fry at Brocach is still from from traditional. Rather than your choice of cod, walleye, lake perch, or smelt, The Whiskey Den makes you take ALL FOUR...and no, I'm not even kidding. For $16 four different kinds of fish share one plate and there is no option to get them individually. This is a true all or nothing affair. While it's an interesting concept for sure, it's one that falls flat in the end. Each variety of fish typically has its own allure, but something was lost when they shared a plate. Since there were so many to pick through, it was impossible to focus on any one fish making them all blend together in a menagerie of blandness. The same breading was applied to the lot which only furthered the lack of separation. Of the quartet the walleye was the most substantial, but much mushier than we're accustomed to; the cod was probably the best of the bunch as it at least had a firm and flaky texture; the smelt had the expected fishy flavor but little else (there were about six of them in total); and the perch was literally one butterfly (two fillets) that could have just flown away as far as we're concerned (ok, that's harsh, but it really wasn't very good). There was zero flavor to be found here, and essentially no winners in the bunch which is something I would not have thought possible. While the fish(es) failed to impress, the house-cut fries were were the exact opposite. The portion was plentiful and they were perfectly fried making for pure eating enjoyment. These are the kind of fries that always make us think ""why can't every place should just do it like this."" Apparently is must no be all that easy. Uninspired fish needs a good tartar to make it something more and the homemade sauce a the 'cach actually delivered. While it looked dilly it actually made the fish better. It was neither thick nor thin, mayo-y nor sour creamy, it was just amorphous mix that gave the fish some much needed flavor. A nice slab of rye with a bounty of whipped butter came on the side and helped complete things along with it's amigo a house slaw (that actually wasn't very good). Oh well, win some, lose some. I think people are struggling with the new Brocach because it lacks an identity. The old Brocach was an Irish pub through and through - dark wood, traditional grub, lots of whiskey, and Guiness up the butt. While the new incarnation maintained some of those traits (specifically the 'skey) it lost a lot of the character (and charm) that people glum on to. While I was never a real proponent of the Friday Fish of yesterday, at least the haddock felt like it belonged...this mishmash is anyones guess. And maybe that's just what the new Brocach is?

The smell of Fish Fry filled the air, the Badger Basketball team was scheduled to trounce Wofford in the first round of the NCAA tournament and the Hockey team was set to bounce St. Cloud in the WCHA. I was feeling lucky, ready to try some new Fish Frys and watch some great sports action. Unfortunately, the day began on a thud with a crummy visit to  Logans Madtown. No bother, I thought. A couple Badger victories and great dinner will still make for a good day. Well, the hoopsters barely squeaked by a questionable Wofford squad, and the rink rats wound up losing to a St. Cloud State team that has had their number all season. As the afternoon degraded, so did the weather, and by the time dinner rolled around it was cold and raining. The last chance to salvage any part of the day fell to the Brocach Irish Pub, and their Friday Fish Fry special.Brocach has a great reputation in Madison. It is regarded as the finest Irish Pub around, exhibiting plenty of authentic flair matched with traditional cuisine. In order for any Irish Pub to be considered great it is a prerequisite that they offer fish-n-chips every day of the week. In our experience, places that offer fried fish every day are usually not up to snuff on Fridays, when Fish Fry specials rule supreme. Since we consider fish-n-chips to be the slower, less athletic brother, of the Fish Fry we tend to avoid places like the badger den. However, when push comes to shove, they are still claiming to offer a Friday Fish Fry, and need to be part of MadisonFishFry.com. We arrived around 7:15 and were greeted by the thunderous sounds of the house Celtic band playing just inside the doorway. We put our names on the list, and were lucky enough to score a couple barstools from another couple who happened to be leaving just as we arrived. We ordered a round of drinks and within 15 minutes the hostess grabbed us and led us upstairs to our isolated table near the fireplace. The waitress came by a couple minutes later with some menus and ran to get us some more refreshments. On Friday the fish-n-chips at Brocach morphs into a full fledged AYCE Fish Fry with the simple addition of a couple slabs of marble rye and a $3 price hike. The fish came about 15 minutes after the order left for the kitchen and was hot, but not steaming when it arrived. The first portion contained three large haddock fillets which turned out to actually be all I could eat. The fillets were adorned with a golden beer batter that didnt have a ton of flavor, but was not bad either. The actual fish was fairly flaky resulting in a good taste overall as the fish and batter were in good balance. The homemade French fries were also good, but like the fish were colder than I like which led to them being slightly limp. There were certainly a generous amount of them and I probably would have upgraded their score to excellent had they arrive fresh from the fryer.A zesty and thick homemade tartar sauce accompanied the fish and fries into battle, but ran short about two-thirds of the way through the meal. It was a good blend, although one bite was slightly inconsistent and resulted in an unpleasant blast of straight dill. By and large it was tasty and complimented the fish well enough.The toasted marble rye also complimented the fish well, and really helped the fish-n-chips evolve into a traditional Wisconsin Fish Fry. Unfortunately, the luck didnt hold out, and the curry flavored coleslaw about took my breath away. It was a noxious blend which had me pushing it far away after a single bite. It was not pleasing. Overall, I feel I can recommend this Fish Fry special, but just barely. Basically, the food itself was slightly above average, but sports a high price tag. Granted it is AYCE, but $15 is a lot for a Fish Fry regardless, especially when the $12 normal portion is all most people can eat anyway. Bear in mind that their location on the Square lends itself to higher prices, including more expensive drinks, but if you are downtown it is not a bad option. However, for my money I would prefer to take the drive elsewhere for better fish at more reasonable prices. www.brocach.com/home.html7 West MainMadison, WI 53703     (608) 255-2015",4243,0.1776363088388404,0.49629924927393293

On Fridays they offer cod for $8.00 and Lake Perch for $12.50 or so. Again, and somewhat to my dismay, the cod was better than the perch (I got the perch). The cod was beer battered and fairly creamy and flaky. The taste was not totally memorable but I think it was good, not great. The Lake Perch looked like it was processed as the filets were large and almost flat. It tasted okay but I dont think I would recommend getting it especially if the cod is available. There was plenty of food on the plate so there is no need to worry about going hungry here.  The Original French fries were seasoned with Rosemary, or something like it, but were still not terribly good. The waffle fries and the mashed potatoes, which some of my associates chose, were better but still not what we really expected them to be. If we ever go back I will try their potato pancakes which arent available very many places. The tartar sauce tasted fine but seemed to have a strange bluish hue to it, maybe it was the lighting? I kinda hope it was. My friend suspects it was food coloring from some ingredient, pimentos possibly? The little loafs of bread were probably the highlight of meal. They were soft and tasty and served nice and warm. The coleslaw was super creamy and didnt taste very good unfortunately.  BrouxNellies has a cool atmosphere and all the food seemed good, not great.

The Fish Fry that night turned out to be less than spectacular and while enjoying some drinks downtown later they mentioned that we should have tried Herremans in Sun Prairie instead. I was confused because we had actually been to Herremans a couple years back, but heard on the local news that they closed due to tax problems. Apparently, they have recently reopened under new ownership so I figured this week would be as good a time as any to take Kellys suggestion and give them another whirl.We were meeting a few folks for dinner so I phoned ahead to get us a reservation because with a group of seven (like we had) they will usually let you reserve a space. It turned out that this was a great idea since when we showed up there was a long line of people waiting, many of whom were not too pleased with how long it was taking to get a table. According to the scuttlebutt around the room a few waitresses had called in sick which left them understaffed and over patronized. It was a recipe for disaster.Even with our reservation we got in about 15 minutes later than we were supposed to, and the waiting did not end there. We took our big table and waited for the waitress to come over. About 15 minutes later she finally swung by with some water and bread and joked that she was surprised we hadnt left yet. She forgot the butter so we grabbed a dish from our neighbors table. The bread was warm and actually really good (once we got it), much like we would find with the rest of the meal. As the orders went in they were mostly for the fried cod, while one of us went for perch. Unlike most places Herremans gives you a trip to the salad bar with the Fish Fry. The salad bar was good and featured a lot of homemade dressings and the like. However, it was missing some serious salad bar staples like coleslaw, bacon bits, croutons, cheese spread and (my brothers favorite) custard. Apparently the new ownership is not quite up to speed on what make a great supper club salad bar, oh well. At least what was there was fresh and tasty. We all polished off our salads and expected the fish to be ready shortly after. Again, this was not the case and 15 more minutes or so passed before she came back to let us know the fish was almost ready.By the time the fish came 10 minutes after that it I was pretty damn hungry and more than ready for it. The cod turned out to be pretty good although it clearly sat for a little bit and was not scalding hot. The batter was light and flaky, but since it sat it did collect some grease. The 12 dollar price tag was a fair price for the three generous cod loins. The perch eater in our party was much less pleased. He ordered his perch with a baked potato which was somehow transcribed as Perch Baked. He received 6 tiny fillets with drawn butter and no breading, and a baked potato on the side. It was tragic, and Jeff was flabbergasted that they would try to serve baked perch. This was more the waitress fault than Jeffs as she should have clarified that he indeed wanted baked perch since perch is almost always fried. This was our first perch fail.Herremans is one of the few places around that offer potato pancakes so I knew I needed to give them a try. Like the baked perch these pancakes were a little odd. They seemed very pre-formed, almost like a chicken patty or turkey burger. They tasted alright, but like many other things our waitress forgot the apple sauce which was a total bummer and probably would have made them much better. The only element of this Fish Fry that was right on was the tartar which was great and really helped to make the lukewarm fish much more edible. Overall, this is a tough Fish Fry to recommend due to Herremans total disorganization. When you have a 6:30 reservation and they cant get you out the door before 9:00 something is definitely wrong. The food was actually good, but the poor service was almost enough to trump it. The waitress was very nice and apologized several times for the chaos, but the poor coordination rubbed off on all aspects of the meal. I believe the food could have been great if served scalding hot in a timely fashion. As it stands the new ownership has some serious kinks to work out before we will be back. 109 W.

A couple years back we moved far enough away that it was no longer easy to just swing by and it basically fell off our radar. My recollection of their Fish Fry was slightly hazy and since they didn’t have a proper write up on MadisonFishFry.com I figured this frigid Friday would be a good opportunity for us to get reacquainted. RP Adler’s is a newer, kind of yuppie-style establishment. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing as the restaurant is very modern looking and clean but does lack some of the character you find at an old school Wisconsin Supper Club. It features a spacious, well lit bar with a large dining room with cathedral-like ceilings. At a nice place you like this you would expect a nice Friday Fish Fry and that is what you get at Adler’s.There are two Fish Fry options at Adler’s and they serve them for both lunch and dinner, which is great (it sucks to know of places that have great Fish Fry but only serve it after 5pm). The first option is cod, which comes as 2 or 3 pieces for 8 or 9 bucks. I went with the second option which was the lake perch. It was more expensive at $14 but as I recalled worth the difference. After this round I am not quite so sure. It was good but I’m not sure it is twice as good which it would really need to be to justify the cost.  The Perch filets were thin and coated in a rich and thick batter which dominated the taste. It was good but I usually like a lighter batter that lets the fish shine through. The French fries that came with the Fish Fry were very good and coated with some seasoning salt which really pepped them up. The tartar sauce was good and plentiful which helped to round out a very solid core of Fish Fry items. The coleslaw really didn’t do it for me even though it actually appeared quite appetizing. The bread was also a bit of a letdown for me even though I think I would normally like it. I pretzel log just doesn’t seem to fit with a Fish Fry…RP Adler’s is a nice place, no doubt about it. Usually if you show up around dinner time you should expect to wait a good 45 minutes holding one of those little vibrate-and-light-up-drink-coaster things but since we were eating a late lunch we had no problem getting in which is great. The service was very good and all the food we had was obviously of high quality. Overall, this is an easy one to recommend. Nice place, nice food, nice service. When all is said and done I guess you can sum Adler’s up in a single word: nice.www.rpadlers.com8202 Watts RoadMadison, WI 53719     (608) 828-1250",2644,0.20951721455627703,0.5415875877594629

Everyone has a different idea about what they want from the most sacred of weekly meals, and the staunch Wisconsinite isnt always willing to sacrifice theirs to the unknown. Just such a quagmire was placed upon MFF this particular Friday. With a sizeable crew in tow we were forced to be the bigger fish, and set aside our preference for new, undiscovered Fish Fry in the name of camaraderie and the greater good.With that in mind, we passed on Cranberry Creek, and instead opted to join forces with our friends at the Maple Tree in McFarland. The first wave of our group arrived right at 7pm and made haste to the table(s) the restaurant was nice enough to let us reserve on a Friday. Within 15 minutes the remaining 12 of us straggled in and made their way over. By this time the core of our group were well into our first round of drinks and on a first name basis with the waitress so when she returned orders went in like lightning. Drinks  Fish  Boom! On Friday the Maple Tree offers three of the major players in the Fish Fry game: cod, lake perch and walleye. Between the 12 of us we managed to sample all the styles, although the cod was far and away the most popular choice. Before the fish would find its way to us, we were allowed a trip to the salad bar. The bar was freshly loaded and meticulously groomed by several salad re-stockers. While the selection was good it wasnt necessarily exhaustive and at least one person made their desire for a wider variety of veggies known. What was there was good however, as the slaw was zesty and creamy, the cottage cheese fit the bill, and the cheddar soup filled the chowder-void adequately. Along with our salads we were also treated to a couple of the small slice-it-yourself bread loafs on a mini-cutting board, which we just love. MFF knows the drill with these little ditties and always lets the knife do the work which results in minimum bread-smoosh. If you have ever seen a novice cut into these babies you know exactly what Im talking about when I tell you it is an art form.As we polished off the bread and the soup (and one of us a cheese-spread mountain) the fish appeared and our focus shifted.  While it took a good 20 minutes to see the fish, it clearly was a function of demand on the kitchen and not slow service as it was still nice and hot when we got it. Wasting no time I dove into the first of my six mildly-meaty perch fillets and enjoyed what it had to offer. The main take home from the perch was adequacy. While it wasnt the best we have had, it was freshly breaded (although the breading was a little thicker than we like to see on our perch), and it had a good flavor (although not the best). Overall, it was good, and good perch disappears quickly when MFF is around. Like the perch the cod was tasty, but not mind-blowing. While Ruthie despised it (she likes thick, crispy beer batters apparently) the bulk of group enjoyed its buttery flavor and light breading. I found it to be a little spongy, but that said, the piece I tried was no longer scalding hot when I finally got my hands on it so maybe a fresh piece would have knocked my socks off?  We feel very confident with our synopsis of the cod and the perch, but we feel less secure in our opinion on the bite or two of the walleye we tried. While the walleye seemed to be good, by the time we got to it, it was bordering on cold and not fit for a full review. That said, it clearly would have been satisfactory at least, and had we gotten to it fresh from the fryer may well have been excellent. Partnering with my perch were a fantastic heap of hash browns with cheese and onions. These homemade shreds were delicious, and slathered with tons of onion and real cheddar cheese. Being a Supper Club youd expect the Maple Tree to represent the browns well, and Im proud to say they were more than up to snuff. While the perch was very good on its own, the tartar sauce really took it up a notch. This homemade blend boasted a pantload of mayo, but also an above average amount of relish. It was real nice and put the crispy coated perch into the totally-tantalizing territory.The Maple Tree is a classic Supper Club and as such youd expect them to represent our classic Wisconsin tradition well. Sure, at $15 it isnt exactly the cheapest Fish Fry you are going to find, but when you take the fresh bread loaves, the trip to the salad bar and generous portions, it all adds up.

As I browsed the pages I saw a lot of names I recognized and a couple I didn’t. One of the names that came up more than once was The Maple Tree Supper Club in McFarland. Several people had chimed in and suggested that this was a top notch local Fish Fry. While heading to other Fish Fry spots I have seen The Maple Tree more than once but never thought to stop and give them a try.The Maple Tree is located right on Highway 51 in McFarland and based on the few time I had driven past seemed like a small and kind of dingy little place. Once we arrived I realized it is actually quite a bit nicer. On Friday nights the Maple Tree has Cod and Lake Perch on special but also serve Walleye and Blue Gill, both of which are on the everyday menu. With the Cod there is an option for 1 piece for $9, 2 piece for $10 or 3 piece for $11. The Lake Perch is $14 for 3 nice sized butterflies which works out to 6 filets. The Cod had a light flaky batter and tasted like it was drowned in butter before being fried. It tasted good and was flaky but was very creamy due to the butter. The Lake Perch was actually even better. The batter was similar to the Cod but the Perch itself was delicious. Both styles of Fish were good and easily recommendable but the Perch was better and is some of the best I have had. Since we were eating dinner with a few friends there were several potato options on the table. The French fries that I got with the Lake Perch were good but could have been hotter. Apparently the mashed potatoes were the best of all topping the hash browns as well as my fries. The tartar sauce was also very good but left me on empty after my 6 generous pieces of Perch. The Maple Tree is a true Supper Club and with the Fish Fry you get a trip to their fresh and well stocked salad bar. You also are treated to a lovely little loaf of fresh bread with cutting board. The bread was warm and tasted great paired with the salad, coleslaw and cottage cheese. There was also a seafood chowder available at the salad bar but I was simply not in the mood.Overall I can easily recommend this Fish Fry. Our waitress was a lovely lady who did a fine job dealing with a table of seven. The Supper Club was very clean and pretty nice. There was no wait for a table which is a rarity, but this may have been partially due to the weather. The fish was great, the tartar and the potatoes were good, and the rest of meal was spot on.

Most places that dish up the Friday Fish Fry specialize in the fried goods so it can be tough to find a place that does Fish Fry as well as non-fried good equally well. Since we had not been to the Oakleaf Restaurant in Cottage Grove and their menu looked fairly diverse I decided that they were a good candidate to satisfy both of us.The Oakleaf Restaurant is in the clubhouse of the Oak Golf Course just north of Cottage Grove. The restaurant itself is a little out of the way and hard to find, partially due to their tiny sign that we drove right past. From the outside the Oakleaf looks like your typical clubhouse restaurant/bar. There were surprisingly few cars in the parking lot which gave us an uneasy feeling since it was close to 8:30 and we thought they may not serve late. As it turns out the place was just incredibly empty and we were the only people there at the time actually eating dinner. There were about 6-10 people milling around the bar and 4-5 waitresses and bartenders, but that was it. It was weird, was everyone at home watching the debate or the Brewers? I couldn’t figure it out. Regardless we were here and we were hungry for a Fish Fry. The Friday special at the Oakleaf consists of either a two piece for $10 or three piece fried Cod for $12. I opted for the three piece and was not disappointed. The Cod was served ungodly hot. The batter was light was flaky and the fish itself pretty tasty. The filets were long and thin, probably larger size than average. The “Yukon Potatoes” served in lieu of French fries were decent but I would much rather have had the fries. The tartar sauce was actually very good and I had to ask for an extra cup since the original did not come close to being enough for three pieces of fish. The little loafs of bread were served before the fish came out and were tasty but served cold. The coleslaw was very average and not memorable.Overall the food was very good and I think it this is an easy Fish Fry to recommend. The service however was surprisingly slow considering we were the only people in the place. I would assume with only one table to worry about the waitress would have been all over us but to my dismay this was not the case. I wonder if lackluster service is why there were not more people eating there for the Fish Fry? Regardless, the Fish Fry was good, as was the salad my girlfriend got.golftheoaks.com/clubhouse/oak-leaf-restaurant/4740 Pierceville RoadCottage Grove, WI 53527     (608) 837-4774",2631,0.07786044973544975,0.5650099206349206

Few things in life are more frustrating than having Fish at a place one day only to go back later and find it to be drastically different. Its almost maddening, but seems to be a recurring theme at the Silver Eagle.We fell in love with the walleye at the Eagle on our second visit back in 2011 (our first visit was cod in 2009 and was just so-so). The walleye was plentiful, delicious, and incredibly cheap which is win-win-win in our book. We vowed to come back time and again and stuff our faces with fantastic freshwater fish until they gave us a reason not to. Well, that reason came in 2012 when the batter changed dramatically and the sides regressed as well. We decided at that point it was best to just go our separate ways and take some time off. We took a couple years, cooled off, but eventually returned in 2014 only to find it to be better than ever. We were back in love, but in classic Eagle fashion it wasnt meant to last. On this most recent visit things fell off again, and even worse than before. The walleye used to be one fillet, but this time it was two. More fish, thats gotta be a good thing, right? Youd think so, but when the fish is lower quality and pre-breaded that is never a good thing. Add in the fact that it had a slightly fishy flavor and lacked the papery, well-seasoned breading it was worse for the wear. All we could think was what the hell happened here?! Unlike the inconsistent fish, the house-cut Eagle fries have made, and continue to make, the grade. They are plentiful and salty and executed perfectly. This is how all places should play their potatoes. When a place can do fries this well tartar sauce should be an afterthought, but the Silver Eagle just cant stay consistent. One time its think and creamy, but the next its mildly runny with too much dill. As far as texture goes its acceptable, but at least one standard deviation above the mean as far as dill goes. A snorer of a slaw was pretty bland and basically 100% cabbage. It lacked any sort of pop, but luckily, some baked beans came with it and had a bunch of burger and three or four different kinds of beans. We couldnt tell if they were from a can, but regardless they were a welcome addition. While we do get sick of the regular dinner roll the atypical roll here was a step back. Perhaps ours were just stale, but they were really tough to chew through, to the point where we had to gnaw through. Honestly, were just not sure what to make of it all. We have a real love/hate relationship with the Silver Eagle as they just cant seem to maintain a level of excellence. This time around their Fish Fry has morphed again into something we just dont feel confident recommending. Overall, we wouldnt recommend this Fish Fry, and the inconsistency just makes it a little too risky for my tastes. www.silvereaglebar.net5805 Monona DriveMonona, WI 53719",2918,0.11919558783965559,0.4883531487345045

Its tasty. Its cheap. Its highly accessible. All good things on a busy Wisconsin Friday.For starters the Eagle offers a full-loaded walleye Fish Fry for nine bucks. Yeah, you heard that right, nine stinking bucks. And this isnt some corner-cutting, fly-by-night operation either. Everything is done by hand and made to order. The kitchen is quick and often times the fish comes so swiftly its hard to believe  were talking under three minutes here. Sometimes the walleye fillet is on the small side, but hey, were talking nine bucks here, its probably not going to be a 12 ouncer. The small-eye is the perfect size for lunch and features flaky, moist meat with a sweet flavor. It houses a light breading that varies in spiciness from Friday to Friday  sometimes heavily-seasoned, sometimes not. Either way, it pairs well with the consistency of the fish and is bolstered by a delicious tartar. This sauce is simply superb with a creamy texture and a zesty finish. Its a great, homemade blend with something unique thats tough to put a finger on. No matter how fine the fish, or savory the sauce, the highlight of the Eagle Fry has to be the house-cut French fries. The meal comes with mashed potatoes by default, but make sure to ask for the fries, its well worth it as they are truly outstanding and everything a fry should be. A homemade slaw looks plain, but packs a serious horseradish blast. Kapow! The roll also packs a wallop on occasion and this rendition was a big, fluffy bun with a wonderful taste. It was clearly fresh and an excellent addition this Fish Fry. With so much going for it its hard to not want to come back to the Silver Eagle every Friday.

Despite the fact that its adjacent to Madison it maintains its own identity and has a strong sense of town pride. Everywhere you go you see paraphernalia touting Monona Grove athletics, and the people really seem to enjoy spending their time and money locally. Its kind of peculiar considering how many great things lie just minutes away in Madison, but their devotion clearly helps them maintain a sense of autonomy. That said, there are not a lot of noteworthy restaurants in Monona, and even fewer noteworthy Fish Frys.Mononas Fish Fry of record as far as were concerned can be found at the Silver Eagle Bar & Grill. While the building itself looks like a revamped Hardees once inside it feels like anything but. Its a clean and spacious bar with plenty of light and a pretty ambitious menu. The Friday specials are also notable and incredibly affordable considering what you get. While there is a cod special, the real deal is the $8 walleye plate. Yes, you heard that right, eight stinkin bucks! Sure, you only get one fillet, and its on the smallish side as far as walleye is concerned, but its still a great deal. Historically, the Eagle used a spicy beer batter which, while tasty, was too thick and masked the fish. This time around things were different, and way better if I do say so myself. The updated coating was much lighter, and more of a breading than a gooey batter. It was nice and flaky with a good amount of spice to pair with the walleye essence. Overall, it was very nice for the price and will definitely be worth coming back for. By default the Fish Fry comes with mashed potatoes, but seasoned veterans know to ask for the house-cut fries instead. These fries are simply superb, served with plenty of seasoning and fried until they are nice and crispy (which is tough to do). They are a Straight A spud, no ifs and or buts about it. Next in line was the tartar sauce which was good, but far from perfect. It was a little dilly, and pretty plain, but not anything to complain about. The roll also didnt draw much criticism as it was served warm, and was doughy and sumptuous. Last, but not least, was the Silver Eagle slaw which was cool and creamy, with a serious horseradish punch. Kapow! Take that taste buds! For $8 you really cant do much better than the Fish Fry we got this time around at the Silver Eagle. The fish was delish, the fries were practically perfect, and the rest of the items did what they needed to do. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and think it puts Monona on the map as far as food is concerned. www.silvereaglebar.net5805 Monona DriveMonona, WI 53719",2673,0.3000851254480286,0.5855081925243216

We were just at the Silver Eagle a couple months ago and everything was great. The walleye was thick and flavorful, the house-cut fries came standard with the fish, and the coleslaw was superb. This time was different; everything was off way off. What the hell?I just wanted a quick and tasty lunch and every trip Id made to the Monona mainstay has been just that  great fish, no BS, in and out. For some reason things just didnt add up today, sure the food came fast, but everything else was wrong in some way. The walleye fillet was much larger than what Ive come to expect at the Eagle, but was over-fried. What is usually a medium-thick batter seemed to be doubled-up and virtually consumed the fish. It was way too crispy and had absolutely no flavor. It was not appetizing in any way and had fryer basket indentations all along one side. WTH? I thought just ordering the fish would yield me the Silver Eagles house-cut fries, but the plate came with mashed potatoes instead. The large scoop was covered with a bevy of shredded cheese, but even so, was boring and flavorless  certainly nowhere near as good as the fries Ive enjoyed in the past.The tartar was also a bit of a letdown being thinner that I recalled it being and having more dill. The batter on the fish was simply too much, and no matter how hard the tartar tried it failed to quell the batter beast. Even though the walleye was way off the biggest disappointment on this outing was definitely the coleslaw. The previous incarnation was practically perfect which really makes me wonder how the latest rendition came to be. This stuff was nothing less than awful. It was some kind of orange goo with chili pepper added to give it a kick. It simply didnt work, and was likely one of the worst slaws Ive ever laid my lips on. Ick. The plain old roll was a plain old roll, and slightly crushed (which is apparently the norm at the Silver Eagle). Im not really sure what to say other than this visit to the Silver Eagle was a huge disappointment. Everything missed the mark in some way and the whole experience left me somewhat soured. Overall, I would not recommend the Fish Fry I had this trip, and I will think twice before I come back again. www.silvereaglebar.net5805 Monona DriveMonona, WI 53719",2300,0.02756410256410257,0.508295177045177

Not all that many places have the freshwater treat during the noon hour so when I get the opportunity I usually seize it. I knew the Silver Eagle Bar & Grill had walleye for dinner, but wasnt 100% sure if they had it for lunch or not, so when I arrived I was pleasantly surprised to see it listed at the top of the specials board. Needless to say, an opportunity was seized.  The bar looked inviting so I grabbed an open stool and went from there. In no time I had a Spotted Cow and steaming hot plate walleye in front of me and got to work. Since its only nine bucks the portion isnt gigantic, but even so, the meal is still a great value. The single walleye fillet is long and thin, and coated with a delicious, medium-thick beer batter. The generously seasoned batter works really well with the fish even though it is on the thick side the walleye is on the thin side  true animal magnetism.As fine as the fish is, the real star of this show are the  Silver Eagles homemade French fries. Finding fries that are cut in-house is a rarity (especially at sports bars) and these shoestring-style spuds are expertly fried and simply superb. They are every bit as good as some of the fancy frites you find at more expensive restaurants downtown. A thick tartar tails the walleye, but does have a little more dill than Id like to see. Regardless of this dill-ema, the sauce improves the palatability of fish and I took almost all of it down. Rounding out this excellent Fish Fry is a side of creamy coleslaw and a regular dinner roll. The slaw is a perfect example of what a creamy slaw should be and really packs a punch. The roll comes in on the opposite end of the spectrum, and I almost didnt come in altogether (it had to be requested when I noticed a butter packet with no purpose). It was sub-Wilsons.Youre not going to find many lunch hour Fish Frys as satisfying than this one. Its a great deal for a premium fish and comes with all the fixins you expect. Overall, we highly recommend the walleye Fish Fry at the Silver Eagle Bar & Grill. Its definitely the best Monona has to offer. www.silvereaglebar.net5805 Monona DriveMonona, WI 53719",2195,0.2199738455988456,0.5551284826284826

Moreover, we have depleted most all the Frys in the surrounding area as well. It has gotten to the point where we have to drive 30 minutes or more to find a Fish Fry we havent been to, and its getting harder and harder to find friends willing to go that far for dinner.  Thus, we have reached the point of revisiting places that we enjoyed the first time around, but thought might have more to offer. This bout was Madison Fish Fry vs. The Silver Eagle II  Melee on Monona.We were to be five deep this Friday and when Paco and I arrived before the rest we were blown away to find the only open table in the place with exactly five chairs at it. It was a small miracle and hinted at great things to come. Now, The Silver Eagle is a pretty sizeable place, and the whole show was tasked to one ultra-diligent waitress, who not only noticed our arrival and got us drinks as soon as she could, but came back as soon as our friends arrived and returned to the table time and again as appropriate throughout dinner. She was really a marvel, and we all appreciated watching her execute her craft.Adding further to our list of small victories were the Friday specials at The Silver Eagle. While the $9 cod special might not be anything out of the ordinary, the similarly priced walleye is. Each plate featured a slightly smaller than average walleye fillet served piping hot. The bounty came roughly 20 minutes after we ordered, which is a little long, but when the place is this busy you take what you can get. The fish was delicious, almost surprisingly so. It featured a light breading which had some spice evident. It was very good, pull-apart flaky and complimented the light and flaky walleye perfectly. All in all, it was superb and simply a fantastic value at a mere nine skins. I was also able to get my hands a chunk of the cod, although at that point I was a few beers too deep, and the fish a few minutes too late for me to make a fair judgment. Word on the street was that it was good and a fine value for $9.A limp, but delicious pile of homemade fries were stacked up alongside the fish and practically stole the show from it. The well-seasoned spuds came in a generous portion and were simple delicious. They were far and away some of the best weve had recently, and could easily hold their own with some of the fancier frites in town (a la Graze, or jacs). The tartar was also user friendly, although somehow forgettable. All I know for sure is that every last drop got consumed so I assume it was tasty, but the intricacy of the Eagle sauce escapes us. Thick? Creamy? Zesty? Not known, but presumed. Like the tartar the slaw was good, but also somewhat forgettable. From what we remember it was a standard blend, but appeared to be homemade. Not forgettable in any way, and adding a change of pace was a delightful little warm pretzel roll. Not only was it cute to look at, but also really tasty. It had a wonderful fresh crust, and was a welcome respite the plain old dinner roll which we are all t0o accustom. A little pat of room temperature butter also didnt hurt its appeal.  What can we say? It looks like we waited too long to return to The Silver Eagle. Everything about this visit was a huge step up from our lunch back in 2009, and we are totally blown away. Overall, we highly recommend the walleye at The Silver Eagle; its an all-around fantastic deal, and possibly the best fish Monona has to offer. The Eagle has landed, and from the looks of it, it brought a walleye in its beak.www.silvereaglebar.net5805 Monona DriveMonona, WI 53719",3657,0.22661674347158214,0.5589025430960914

Some bars take a lot of pride in their Friday special and do it right. There are others that have a “Fish Fry” just to get you in the door when it is really nothing more than a glorified fish stick. The Silver Eagle in Monona puts forth the effort and makes a tasty little lunch time Fish Fry for a good price (around 8 bucks).The bar itself is actually really nice and clean. Even though it is in Monona and smoking is still allowed I didn’t walk out smelling like an ash try or feeling half drunk which is certainly a plus. There are actually two fish options for lunch: Beer Battered Cod and Walleye; today Cod was the fish of choice. It took about 10 minutes for our food to be ready which we easily killed with a couple glasses of the Cow. The fish was served very hot and was quite good. The beer batter was firm but not overly crispy which added a nice contrast to the flaky Cod underneath. This was good beer battered fish, no two ways about it. The French fries were substituted with mashed potatoes topped with shredded cheese. They were good but I would still rather have the fries. The tartar sauce was a good blend of mayo and relish but did have a fair amount of dill in it. It was acceptable but not ideal.In addition to the fish and potatoes a side of coleslaw was served along with a dinner roll. The roll was actually pretty good, although a little firm and dry but the slaw was really soupy and kind of grody.Sometimes bars think they can just have a bartender sling to food out as well as tend the bar which can really lead to some lackluster service. The Silver Eagle has a waitress who roams the bar specifically for food orders, and she did a great job of getting them on the table as soon as they were out of the kitchen. Overall this was a fine lunch time Fish Fry and I will certainly not hesitate to stop back sometime. Next time maybe I’ll try the Walleye…www.silvereaglebar.net5805 Monona DriveMonona, WI 53719",2038,0.2452991452991453,0.5108262108262108

I really wanted to like this place. I wasn’t sure exactly what to expect but was convinced that it had to be nicer than Bennett’s used to be. I arrived at Azzalino’s at about 12:45 and was somewhat surprised that there were not more people around. I took one of the open seats at the bar and waited for the bartender/waiter/cook/probable owner to finish the food he was making for a take out order. I waited a good 15 minutes before he finally had the order finished and was able to get me a drink. I would have been long gone if not for the fact I was meeting a fried there for lunch. The “help wanted” sign out front probably should have read “help needed” as this guy really could have used someone to take a few tasks off his hands. Nonetheless I stuck it out and ordered some fish.There are basically three fish options for Fish Fry on Friday: Cod, Walleye and Catfish, although the owner was sure to include Salmon, Tuna and some other stuff as well. I ordered the cod which costs $8.33 and comes with French fries and a choice of potato salad or coleslaw. The fish was served in three massive chunks and tasted fairly decent but was very heavy and pretty greasy. I could barely finish two of these monsters much less three. The French fries were straight cut potatoes which were nothing special but still good. The tartar sauce was store bought and although there were two options, Beaver and Kraft, they didn’t make it any better. Store bought tartar sauce just does not cut the mustard. The potato salad was also just okay and I assume not much better than the slaw would have been. Maybe the best part of the Fish Fry was the roll which was basically a grilled hamburger bun with melted butter, which isn’t saying a whole lot but still tasted good. Azzalino’s is actually a pretty decent looking little place inside. All the tables are made from old barrels and along with a few other touches they do add a “Speakeasy” ambiance to the place. Overall there is simply no way I could recommend this Fish Fry especially with all the other great ones out there. It is too bad to because the owner or whoever was working that day seemed like a really nice guy but just is not on his ‘A’ game when it comes to the Fish Fry.

Relatively speaking, there just arent that many for a city this size, which is really kind of sad. Only a handful spring to mind, and even a few of those dont totally fit the mold. Feilers is just one such example.Feilers is kind of a hidden gem as far as Madison goeswell, its definitely hidden, the gem part is debatable. It fits the supper club mold in that its old school, has a dark interior, and the requisite menu, but there is something about it that comes up short when compared to some of the classic supper clubs out there. Id say its really more of a supper club lite. Of course, even a supper club lite has Fish Fry on Friday, and the lunch special at Feilers is only $6.75. Obviously for six seventy-five you cant expect the word and the lunch portion is conservative, but appropriate. Five to six small cod nuggets start things off and add up to roughly 6 oz. of meat. The fish is flaky and pure, and cloaked in Feilers moderately thick, but severely tasty beer batter. These doughy little golden-brown bites are rich and creamy and definitely fall on the decadent end of the fish spectrum. A small handful of thick, Julienne-cut fries come with the nuggets and while they have a satisfying crunch and are well-fried there is nothing really special about them. The homemade tartar on the other hand is exceptional. Its incredibly thick and creamy with visible amounts of relish. It stands up to the creamy cod without giving an inch which is really saying something since the fish is so rich. A wispy hamburger-looking bun with some rock hard butter comes before the fish and while its edible its not necessarily good, moreover its just there. The coleslaw is better, with a creamy, hearty pop - just as it should be. While Madison isnt a supper club town per se, there are a few places doing their best to uphold the statewide tradition, and Feilers is doing their part. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry, and think it a great choice for a cheap lunch. For those looking for more, the dinner portion is much larger and comes with a choice of potato including twice-baked and hash browns.

You are usually met with: “No, really?” when you explain to someone it is located in the shadow of the Beltline right next to the KFC on Verona Road. Most people know exactly where that is, but have no idea there is a classic Supper Club right there. Hell, I went through that KFC drive thru many-a time before I realized it. Even if it is in kind of an odd area Feiler’s is really Wisconsin in a nutshell so you know they have a great Fish Fry. The Badger hockey game started at 7:00 and I had some decent seats. Since it was the second week of Lent I knew a place like Feiler’s would be busy, but I figured if we went early enough I could get in and out in around an hour and fifteen minutes or so and still catch the whole game. It turned out that even arriving at 5:30 wasn’t enough. We pulled into the parking lot and it was absolutely packed. We actually had to park around back in an area that I didn’t even know existed. We got inside and got on the list as quickly as we could and were told it would be 25 minutes or so.  We waited for a good 50 minutes before our table was actually ready; this was putting me real close to 7:00 and I was getting a little worried about it but we were in too deep at this point to leave. The waitress wasn’t exactly snappy either and by the time we got our food it was shortly past the hour. The food was served nice and hot though so I assume it came out as soon as it was ready. The two options for Friday Fish Fry are Cod and Bluegill, I went for the Bluegill instead of the Cod and it was quite good. The Bluegill was plentiful and well fried with a thin batter was very which really let the taste of the fish out. The tartar sauce at Feiler’s is a welcome compliment to the fish and I had no problem finishing the whole cup as well as the generous portion of Bluegill. Now, I know I asked for French fries but instead got a twice baked potato which I wasn’t willing to send back because I was already behind schedule. Luckily the twice baked was good enough so I can’t complain too much. The coleslaw was decent as was the small basket of bread that awaited our arrival. Regardless, the fish itself is very good so even average side items are enough to make his Fish Fry worth it.Feiler’s is a tiny little place and from the looks of it hasn’t been remodeled in some time; you might almost say it looks a little dumpy. Well, the best part about all of that is that they know it, and even make light of that fact. Once you get a table and actually sit down it becomes clear and for this reason Feiler’s wins the award for best placemat at a Madison restaurant. This is a good old fashioned atmosphere you come to expect in dark Wisconsin Supper Clubs all over the state.Overall this is a great Fish Fry and a true Madison classic. The fish is always very good and the atmosphere is great. The service seems to be a crap shoot depending on what time you arrive and which waitress you get; and you usually can’t get seated immediately, but this is kind of what you expect on a Friday so I can’t get too pissy about it. I did wind up missing the first 10 minutes of the Badger game but that is the price you pay sometimes.www.feilersrestaurant.com4506 Verona RoadMadison, WI 53711     (608) 271-6237",3342,0.17487549603174604,0.45171230158730147

There are quite a few businesses in this area and since they are right near the confluence of the two major lakes you figure the restaurants around here should have some good Fish Fry. It was a nice sunny day so I thought a trip to the Bourbon Street Grille and lunch overlooking the water was sounded just about right.We arrived around 1pm and found a spot in their “parking lot” pretty easily although with waterfront establishments parking can be a little weird. To get to the restaurant you go in the front door, take a right, head up a flight of stairs, then around the corner, and finally down a long hall…just getting to the actual dining area was quite a little trek in itself. There were not a lot of people in the place and we noticed a sign on our way in saying there was no alcohol available which made me a little uneasy about what was coming. We got a nice table by the window and some h2o. The lunch Fish Fry consists of a two-piece Haddock with fries and tarter for nine bucks. I ordered mine and sat back and waited. There were a couple signs posted where their liquor should have been that read “Empty shelves due to racism in Monona and selective enforcement.” When we asked the waiter what it was all about his only comment was something along the lines of “it is a long story…” Now I was really starting to wonder, but as long as the fish was good I really wouldn’t care. Our food came fairly quickly and was good but nothing really special.The haddock was two long thin fillets which tasted very good and had a nice light, flaky batter. It did taste slightly over fried which made it a little greasy and a little mushy but not too bad. The French fries were about the same, well fried but just not anything overly memorable. The tartar sauce was okay but really a jumbled pile of mayo, relish, dill and a bunch of other stuff I could not quite put my finger on. It left it tasting kind of store bought and unoriginal. Even with just okay fish, fries and tartar they could have been recommendable if they had anything to support them but there was a total lack of bread, coleslaw or any other side items. For $9 I should at least get a slice of Wonder and some kind of slaw.Overall this Fish Fry kind of left me wondering. It seems like if they would just kick it up a notch this could be a great Fish Fry as it stands it is a overpriced and underwhelming. The place is great, the ambiance is nice and having the water right there is superb. I really wonder what happened to the liquor license and if some of the general malaise surrounding the restaurant is due to the fact they are losing business because of it?

It isnt easy, believe me. Somehow I managed to persuade my fiancée that, if nothing else, Fat Jacks would have a good salad bar. I had no idea if it was true or not, but based on popular opinion (computer geeks) I somehow convinced myself, and her, that it was so. We took the short cruise down a torn-up Monona Drive and went to get fat with Jack. Im sure we looked like quite a pair to our friendly waitress, who was slightly taken aback when not one, but two patrons ordered dinner sans-barbecue. What can I say? We are who we are. I was here for their $10 Friday Fish Fry special which comes complete with: ranch fries, garlic bread, tartar, and homemade slaw. She brought my hot plate of grub about 10 minutes or so after I ordered, well before m lady finished her salad. As per usual I dove right in and grabbed one of my four beer battered beauties. This fish was good, but not without a couple flaws. By and large the thick cuts were tender and flaky, but there were a couple darkish chunks that didnt get trimmed off. These parts were a little less savory, but were minimal at least. The batter was pretty good, as it was nice and crisp, but not too thick. The taste reminded me of the cod at the Middleton Sport Bowl which is nothing to shake a stick at.The ranch fries that accompanied were also good, probably on par with the fish. They were thick cut and tasty, but like the fish had a couple ugly ducklings in the flock. I drenched them and the fish in the homemade looking tartar which was served in what appeared to be a small bucket (there was a ton of it). This sauce was super thick and creamy; comprised primarily of mayo with just a small hint of relish. As a man who loves his tartar I usually clean it out, so you know there is plenty to go around if I cant finish it, and I couldnt. Fat Jacks represented the Big 3 admirably.Rounding out this Fish Fry was a nice big slice of garlic bread, slathered in butter and some homemade coleslaw. The bread was a welcome addition, but the slaw, while homemade, didnt really suite my palate with its tangy taste. It was nice that both of them were there at least.I have heard nothing but good things about the actual barbecue at Fat Jacks and after stopping by for the fish I feel like I really need to get back there and try it. If they can do fish this well I have to imagine the BBQ is even better. Overall, this is a good Fish Fry that I feel confident recommending. The fish was tasty enough, especially when teamed with the fries and tartar. The turnaround was quick as we were in and out in around 30 minutes total. While it may not be a bastion for vegetarians at least the salad bar at Fat Jacks was fresh which made my dining companion happy enough. I think we will be back to get fat with Jack again soon enough, although next time I might have to break down and try the Que. www.menupix.com/menudirectory/menu.php?id=7302046207 Monona DriveMadison, WI 53716     (608) 221-4220",3037,0.17240762425188658,0.5177985948477751

Deep in the shadows of Oscar Meyer the Locker Room looks like your regular hole-in-the-wall kind of place. It is nothing more that a small block building surrounded by a sea of asphalt. I never judge a book by its cover and I never judge a Fish Fry by how crappy the restaurant looks so I decided that they deserved their shot.The Fish Fry at the Locker Room consists of 3-4 smallish sized pieces of cod for about $7.00. I thought it was going the be All You Can Eat but when the bartender/waitress came around she never asked if we wanted more so I guess it is not. Regardless of if it was AYCE or not I don’t know that I would have wanted more. The fish was very thin and was slightly overcooked which made it a little mushy. In addition the batter was good but since it was so thin it got overly crispy resulting in an odd blend with the mushy fish. 2 of my 4 pieces were thicker cuts and tasted good, but my dining companion was clear to point out that none of his were. Since The Locker Room is a sports bar I feel a sports analogy is apt; they went 2 for 8 for a batting average of .250 which is decent but not going to make a lot of major league rosters. That is unless you are good in the field. And let me tell you, the Locker Room played some pretty good ‘D’. By defense I mean the items that supported or backed up the Fish Fry. The French fries were excellent. They were thick cut, crinkle style fries which were spot on. The tartar sauce was also very good and had a tangy zip, almost miracle whip like but not as quite as zippy. It was still a nice blend of mayo, relish and whatever else. The roll served with the Fish Fry was also just fine and tasted fresh which was somewhat unexpected especially since I didn’t even get bread the previous two weeks.Overall I was pleasantly surprised with this Fish Fry. I expected the place to be a complete dump, but it is actually pretty nice and quite spacious inside. The bar was clean and the food was good in general. The fish itself was hit and miss but everything else about the meal was good which makes it a difficult Fish Fry to recommend. This one is definitely borderline; but in the end my, basket was empty, my belly was full and the PBR was cold.1810 Roth StreetMadison, WI",2330,0.2022282608695652,0.6120164437012262

The culinary mainstay has been at its Nesbitt Road location for what seems like forever and is showing no signs of slowing down. Even though theyre always busy, they find a way to meet the demand and do it with grace and consistency. It is a special place, and the kind of restaurant you take friends and family from out of town since you know they will deliver. Quiveys isnt just in Wisconsin, Quiveys is Wisconsin (as their menu is sure to point out).Quiveys has a few different dining venues and even though weve been there plenty of times weve never eaten in the famed Stone House. Weve pounded parmesan potatoes on the Paddock, and sopped up suds in the Stable Grill, but for whatever reason weve never found ourselves Frying in the Stone House. This Friday was finally our moment since, unlike the Stable, the Stone House actually takes reservations (which was a necessity with a party of seven). We showed up a little early despite the confirmed timeslot and wound up having to wait for a bit while they cleared a large table for us. Eventually we got our spot in what I believe to be Grandmothers Garden  on the upper level. Our waitress came by shorty after everyone was settled, and we got down to business. While the same AYCE Cod Friday Fish Fry served in the Stable is available in the House, I had other things on my mind. I came in search of perch this Friday, and even though it costs $20, and is available every day of the week, I just couldnt resist. Before the fish, a basket of lemon poppy seed muffins was delivered to the table. They were quite unexpected, and somewhat out of context, but exceptionally delicious. These were no mini-muffins either. Each was practically a breakfast, and finishing a whole one was almost too much to handle before the meal even really got going. But go it did, and eventually the fish found its way to the table. The Potter Perch in the House is a little different from the Middleton Perch in the Stable in that it comes with green beans instead of coleslaw and parmesan potatoes instead of French fries (but I believe the fish itself is pretty much exactly the same). The five perch fillets on Potters plate were quite large and quite tasty. Their flaky meat was concealed in a crispy pretzel crust that gave it the feel similar to that of chicken fingers. The dark crust made the fish very ridged and easy to dip, however I usually prefer my perch a little more moist and limber. While the adequately-seasoned breading had a good flavor, and the fish was meaty, I mostly tasted the breading, which is great depending on who you ask.The portion of parmesan potatoes was partially hidden under the plethora of perch, but that didnt keep me from getting after it. As expected, the specialty spuds were superb. They boasted a creamy and crusty dichotomy of deliciousness that could only be improved upon through a larger portion size. While the Parmesan Potatoes really put their mark on this Fish Fry, the tartar sauce continually comes up short. Quiveys sauce is on the thin side, and missing the little zip that could have taken the perch to the next level. There was no zip to be found in the coleslaw either since there was no coleslaw to be found period. The green beans which filled their slot were well-cooked, and as green as can be, but certainly not the complement to the fish that the slaw is. (Full disclosure: I did steal a bite of slaw from one of the other Fryers. It was good. It made me want more.) As far as I can tell, everything in the House is supposed to be a step-up from the more humble Stable, but honestly, I like the Stable a lot more. The atmosphere is more intriguing, the food is a little cheaper, and, of course, there is a bar. Overall, we still recommend the Potter Perch from the Stone House, but would much rather go for the AYCE cod in the Stable on future romps at the Grove. www.quiveysgrove.com6261 Nesbitt RoadMadison, WI 53719     (608) 273-4900",3997,0.13508955383955384,0.47038288288288294

While weve never thought they were Top 3 caliber, weve always highly recommended their Friday special, and have made it a point to visit them with some regularity over the years. Since Quiveys is usually packed on Fridays we decided to show up a little later than normal hoping to avoid the rush (we were also hanging out at the Union Terrace beforehand which made procrastinating ever more enjoyable). We finally pulled in around 8:30 and planned to just dine on the paddock since it was the first Paddock Fish Fry of the year and we didnt want the long wait usually associated with dining indoors at the Grove. Surprisingly, not only was the paddock practically deserted, but the Stable Grill had open tables all over the place. It was a little bizarre, but our party of five was happy to get a table in the without a wait. Perhaps it was the fact that it was a slow night, or just that it was late, but our waitress seemed to have had enough of it. It took her a while to come by and take our orders, and she certainly didnt jump to it after that. It took a good five minutes to get a round of beers, but at least the food was in great shape when it arrived (compliments to the kitchen). One of the great things about Quiveys Fish Fry is their All You Can Eat option. While AYCE isnt totally extinct, not many places are offering it in 2013, and those that are dont give you the option to add it after your first portion like Quiveys does. Theyll let you start with the $13 cod and add the AYCE for a couple bucks later if youre still hungry. Which I, of course, was. Everything came in one fell swoop and looked fine, although we all would have liked to get our hands on the slaw and bread beforehand. The fish featured Quiveys classic beer batter which was rich and tasty. The crispy coating was dark brown, and a little thick, but wasnt over the top. While the fish itself wasnt incredibly flaky, it didnt really matter since the batter had enough flavor to pick up any slack. My first three chunks were on the small side and gone in an instant, but luckily round two wasnt far behind and was more bountiful. I knew the AYCE fish comes with AYCE fries, but what I didnt realize is that its the same deal with the parmesan potatoes. While the freezer fries are no slouch, the PPs are something special and had I known they were available in multiple rounds I would certainly have gotten them instead. As it was, the fries were well-fried and ample, but nothing extraordinary. The tartar was also nothing special, even though it was house-made. It simply wasnt thick enough for the rich cod, and the subtle sweetness of the sauce was overpowered by the big beer batter. At least it wasnt dilly or anything like that. Rounding out the meal was a big basket of sourdough slices and some creamy coleslaw. The sourdough was just great, but the slaw could have use a little more pop. If nothing else, both were consistent and did their duty to little fanfare. If youve never been to Quiveys Grove you really should do yourself a favor and go - it will be worth it, we promise. Overall, we highly recommend the AYCE cod Fish Fry at Quiveys Grove, and while we dont think it is the best of the best, it really isnt too far behind. www.quiveysgrove.com6261 Nesbitt RoadMadison, WI 53719     (608) 273-4900",3476,0.1526321138211382,0.48478803716608604

Summer transitioned into fall and with the seasonal change came the news that our friend Brown was moving yet again, this time all the way to Iowa. Since he is a true Wisconsin boy at heart I knew we needed to send him off with a good Fish Fry and we both thought Quiveys would deliver.We arrived at the Grove at 6pm and found that he and Katie were already there. They had put our group of 13 on the list and been told that the wait was in excess of an hour which I fully expected since a lot of people seem to love this Fish Fry. We grabbed some drinks and mingled with our friends as they slowly trickled into the stable turned restaurant. A couple beers and an hour and fifteen minutes later our group was called and like the livestock that once occupied this same space we shuffled single file to our table and awaited our feeding. Our waitress was on us immediately, dropped some menus, relayed the specials and went to grab us another drink. While there is lake perch on special the star of this show is the beer battered cod. The cod runs about $13 and comes with and option to be upgraded to AYCE for another buck fifty if you decide you are that hungry. We put in our Fish Fry orders and sat back to enjoy the sourdough bread and coleslaw she brought immediately thereafter. The bread wasnt warm but was tasty and had a hint of cinnamon which made it quite unique. The slaw was very so-so, but did put me in the right mood for the fish which came about 10 minutes later. The cod was served as three good sized fillets which were hot, but not scalding. The fish had a great flavor but was a little greasier than I would have liked. The fish itself was clearly high quality and was actually pretty flaky considering how much grease was present. As I grabbed each piece I could feel the warm grease run down my fingers making them glisten in the dimly lit barn. I think most of the grease could be attributed to the beer batter which was a little too thick but still, very tasty and rich. Due to the fact it was a little heavy I thought better of ordering the AYCE and was glad that they give you the option to wait and see how hungry you really are. There are basically two potato options, one being skin-on French fries and the other being a hash brown style bake they call parmesan potatoes. I am a huge fry fan but can honestly say that the parmesan potatoes were better, although the portion seemed a little tiny and would definitely have left me wanting more. Overall they were both excellent. The tartar sauce was less excellent and a little odd really. It seemed to be more of a ranch base than a mayo base. It had some dill present, and was kind of runny. It did taste good but was very nontraditional and didnt really enhance the taste of the cod. What really helped to make this Fish Fry great was the awesome service we received even with a large party. Our waitress was quick and friendly and simply did a great job. The food was very good and obviously of the highest quality which helps to explain why so many people seem to like Quiveys so much. Overall it is easy to recommend this Fish Fry based on the quality of the food, great atmosphere and great service.  Once all the fish was gone we all headed back into the bar to have a farewell drink with our friend Brown and listen to piano renditions of some classic rock tunes as played by my old UW professor Richard (Slick Dick) Shaten. As we relaxed to the sound of Pink Floyds Wish You Were Here I couldnt help but think that Brown would be doing just that next Friday night, wishing he was here at Quiveys enjoying a Fish Fry. www.quiveysgrove.com6261 Nesbitt RoadMadison, WI 53719     (608) 273-4900",3887,0.22041843033509695,0.46646119929453256

I had as some friends coming into town for a bachelor party and from the sounds of it they were interested in getting fish. The last time we had a group this large we went to the Avenue and wound up waiting forever which ruined the whole meal. This time I suggested we go later and try Quivey’s Grove. A few of us arrived a little early and got our group of 11 on the list. The host said it would be about 45 minutes regardless of if we had 2 or 20 so we felt alright about it and took over an area of the bar. Quivey’s is an interesting (and hard to find) place which consists of two restaurants: the fancier Stone House Restaurant and the lower key Stable Grill. In the summer they also do a “Paddock Fish Fry” which is outdoors under the tent and a true Fish Fry experience, but I digress. When it is not summer time the Stable Grill is the place to grab Fish Fry on Friday and that is where we made our stand.The host was almost dead on and we were seated at our table(s) within his 45 minute timeframe. Our 50-ish but very spunky waitress was on us immediately, handing out menus and taking drink orders. She was awesome even though she knew our group was a little rowdier than most. Just about everyone got the Fish Fry, and about half of those went for the AYCE, which probably helped make her job a little easier, not a lot of specialty orders here.The fish came alarmingly fast and was as hot as you would expect. The Cod seemed to have a golden, bioluminescent glow thanks to almost perfect beer batter. It was well fried and absolutely delicious. There were many, many comments on the quality and taste as I overheard conversations around the table. The only problem with the fish being so good was that the AYCE people actually ate all they could eat and were so full they couldn’t man up at the bar later. Oh well, a fair price to pay for fish that good I say. The French fries were also absolutely superb; they were clearly homemade, with the skins on and fried just right. The tartar was good and didn’t detract from the food at all. Quivey’s gives you a delicious basket of warm bread before and an average, but edible coleslaw which bridged the very small gap between ordering and fish eating. Quivey’s is definitely not messing around when it comes to good AYCE Beer Battered Cod. Everything about this meal screams classic Fish Fry. The food is great, the service was spectacular (especially for a huge group like we had) and the place itself is very cool. I know they are always in the running for “Best of Madison: Fish Fry” according to Madison magazine and I can say that it is deserved. I think this is a great Fish Fry, I wouldn’t say it is the best, but great nonetheless. Perhaps a beautiful summer evening, outside on the paddock, Spotted Cow in hand, would put it over the top? I will report back after June 12th.www.quiveysgrove.com6261 Nesbitt RoadMadison, WI 53719     (608) 273-4900",2957,0.3154508196721311,0.5241139734582357

It also really lacked flavor overall but unlike the Perch it was somewhat greasy. I also tried some of the Poorman’s and it too lacked flavor and just was not tasty.

On Friday night this is a rarity which made me feel slightly uneasy about what was coming despite the fact that the restaurant itself was very clean and nice. The Fish Fry at Sweet Sophie’s is All You Can Eat cod served with choice of potato, coleslaw, bread and soup or salad. The cod was decent but not great. The batter tasted fine but was kind of crumbly and didn’t really seem homemade. The fish itself did not have great texture and despite coming from the kitchen steaming hot was already a little greasy and mushy.The French fries were crinkle cut style and were also decent but not great. They came covered in parsley flakes (or something like it) which really did nothing to help them. Apparently the “Baby Reds” or whatever they called them were a better alternative as pointed out by my fellow diners. Relatively speaking the tartar sauce was good but didn’t really do it for me. It was a good combination of mayo and relish, although there was a hint of dill. The coleslaw was actually pretty good too, although it looked runny and nasty.Before the Fish we received our bread and soup/salad. I went for the Seafood Chowder instead of salad wand was not really pleased. If there was any seafood in the Seafood Chowder I certainly didn’t see it or taste it. The salads looked better but also not great. The bread was good however and did come with a tasty bit of apple butter which made it all better.Overall I just can’t quite recommend this Fish Fry. The service was very good and seemed to be a family run operation but the food was just very average. I would not discourage someone who is already going from getting the Fish Fry but if I were recommending places it would not be on the top of the list. The rest of their menu looked very good however and the one person in our party who didn’t get fish enjoyed their dinner very much. I think a return trip to Sophie’s is in order, just not on a Friday night.www.sweetsophies.com1008 Quinn DriveWaunakee, WI 53597     (608) 849-4255",2522,0.25299715909090903,0.5496279761904763

And I'm not just talking about a city like Madison. Sometimes you need to get out of Waunakee, Belleville, or even my hometown of Viroqua. You just want to find a country bar on some back road with cheap beer, pull tabs, and a good honest Friday Fish Fry. Sometimes you need a trip to the Whippoorwill.It had been ages since last we visited the Whip out on Highway 19, and from the sounds of it new owners have taken over since our last visit. Whatever the new owners have done they've done right, and the bar is very clean and well-lit, with plenty of adult and kid-friendly games. We put our order in on the bar-side, then were shown to our table on the dining-side once the food was ready. It worked very well. It's a straight forward Friday menu at the Whippoorwill - cod and shrimp, but the cod comes as a 2 or 3-piece so there is a choice to be made. You can also get your cod baked if you're into that sort of thing...so maybe a second choice??? All dinners come with a trip through the salad bar, or you can tack it on to any sandwich if you're eating light or whatever. This salad bar is pretty robust for a bar-bar, and one any supper club would be proud to call their own. All the salads were fresh, and the slaw was peppy and looked to be homemade. Of course there were pasta salads and the rest of the goodies you'd associate with a real deal salad bar as well. Slabs of soft French bread were there for taking and take I did. Deeeeeeeelightful. We actually had time to finish our salads before the fish arrived, but it was still piping hot when it did. The three planks of cod were nothing to sneeze at size-wise and featured flaky white meat and a thin, crispy breading. Sure, I'd take a hint more salt in the breading, but what was there let the cod take control with its luxurious flavor. This was great simply cod from the first bite to the last. The smoothness of the fish paired remarkably well with the thick and creamy tartar that came along. Served in one of those big squeeze bottles, and straight from and ice cold fridge, I planted squirt after squirt on my plate and ate more than my share. It was big, it was bold, it was perfect. Two-thirds of my plate was covered with lightly battered fries and I took the perfectly crispy numbers to town. While they lasted a long time I can outlast even the tastiest of fries, but these definitely gave me a run for the money. Sometimes you need a trip to the Whippoorwill and after this visit I think those trips may need to happen more often. Everything about this Fish Fry was great from the hospitality to the food, it all clicked. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and think it's high time we put a couple miles on the old car.  7914 Hwy 19Whippoorwill Heights, WI 53529     (608) 798-9991",2813,0.24881618381618378,0.4972276334776335

It is especially difficult to branch out and try somewhere new when you know so many other places that have great food. This Friday I was feeling gutsy so I decided that we were going to roll the dice. I chose the Whippoorwill Tavern on highway 19 out of all the options and ran with it.The Whippoorwill looks like nothing more than a classic Wisconsin bar. It is a tiny building out in the middle of the country and upon entering my suspicions were verified, it is a classic Wisconsin bar. The Friday specials were written on the electric board in neon letters, 2 piece cod - $8.25, 3 piece -$9.25 and Walleye for $11. The everyday menu was neatly written on the chalkboard next to it but drew little of my interest since this was Friday. We bellied up to the bar to grab a quick drink and wait for the ‘hostess’. This is definitely a ‘mom and pop’ joint. Once pop got us our beers mom was right there to grab our orders. There were only two of us this Friday and we both opted for the 3 piece cod. As soon as we ordered we were allowed to sit at one of the ‘family-style’ tables in the dining room and hit the salad bar. It is a rarity that salad bar is included with a Fish Fry but we were both thankful it was since everything on it was good.The fish came out a little slower than I would have guessed it would have but that in no way means it sat under a heat lamp. This stuff was boiling hot. The three suspiciously similar looking pieces of cod were good but not great. The batter was very fish stick style, kind of crumbly but not ideal. The fish underneath was fairly decent but did taste a little processed, the fact that the pieces were all the same size and shape also makes me think this was the case. It wasn’t gross, but I wouldn’t necessarily call it a ‘filet’. The French fries were firm and slightly crispy, pretty good really. The bread was served on the salad bar and was average as was the coleslaw. The tartar sauce was actually very good. It was served family-style and was awaiting our arrival at the table. It was heavy on the mayo, a little relish-y and very thick.Overall I think this was a decent Fish Fry. I don’t think it would be worth going out of your way for but I could see myself stopping again if I were on that stretch of road. The prices were very reasonable for what you got and that is saying something. They certainly aren’t going to make any top 10 list’s here but if you are on highway 19 sometime and find yourself in need of a beer and some bar food hit up the Whippoorwill. 7914 Hwy 19Whippoorwill Heights, WI 53529     (608) 798-9991",2721,0.09434949494949495,0.49671154401154416

So it stands to reason I would love the Fish Fry at Alt n' Bachs (an unbelievable amount), but for some reason it just has never all come together for me. ANB's has a couple different options on Fridays, but the difference is just in the - numbers it's all cod - a 2-piece, a 3-piece, and an all out AYCE. Since it was lunch I figured the cheap $8.25 3-piece made the most sense, although in retrospect I should have just gone for the $11.50 AYCE and I'll tell you why. The 3-piece is basically fish and chips (that's fish, fries or slaw, and tartar) with no bread and yes a choice of fries or slaw (wft?). The AYCE option comes with usual sides, including fries AND slaw, a roll, and also adds a cup of soup. Coulda, woulda, shoulda... The last time we had fish at Alt n' Bach's American TV was still next door and the bar's claim to Friday fame was called Cod Lite (which was anything but light). For some reason those thickly battered cod loins no longer appear on the menu and have been replaced by a lightly breaded version that is markedly better. These smaller pieces are no longer the big wet cod sock they once were, but are still far from prefect. The fish was incredibly firm and although easy to handle, very dry. It literally had to be gnawed apart and lost all its inherent flakiness. Sure, the breading clung like nobody's business, but it didn't have much choice, or flavor for that matter. A small portion of plain Jane Julienne-cut French fries sat sadly on the side as if to say: where's the rest of me? There isn't much to say about them really beyond the fact they were adequately crispy. A very thick and bold tartar tuck pointed the cracks in the cod admirably, but could only do so much. As said, there was no bread and no slaw so I've given you about all I can. While I like a straight-forward Fish Fry this one might have been a little too linear even for me. Overall, we don't recommend this Fish Fry since there is just isn't much there, and what is there is isn't all that great. I'm thinking I need to come back for the AYCE and give them a fair(er) shake. altnbach.com2602 Whalen LaneMadison, WI 53713     (608) 271-9955",2222,0.10183455433455435,0.464577737077737

The tartar sauce was slightly dilly and lost some points due to this fact. It was still edible, but not great. No bread was served but the service itself was very good considering the entire place was being waited on by one young lady. No slaw. The atmosphere is different since you can apparently still smoke at Alt-n-Bachs. I would probably not recommend the Fish Fry here although they do offer AYCE you get so much normally it probably isn't worth the extra $3.altnbach.com2602 Whalen LaneMadison, WI 53713     (608) 271-9955",742,0.09268518518518519,0.43546296296296283

While we havent exhausted all of our in town options, we have hit the most reputable spots, and some of them many, many times. Coachmans Golf Resort in Stoughton is another reputable spot, but one that has fallen by the wayside as far as mff.com is concerned. I have known about it for some time but have never actually been willing to take the near 30 minute drive to get there even though I heard they had one of the best Frys around. Since we had some time to kill I figured we would take the trip and give Coachmans their chance on the tee.We left Madison around 6:30 and pulled into the club just before 7. The place wasnt packed to the gills but was pretty busy. We put our name on the list and were given the 15 to 20 minute bit. We grabbed some drinks at the bar and watched as the groups of people who had arrived before us were ushered one by one from the bar to the dining room. Our table was ready after 30 minutes or so and we were led through the main dining room into the gloomier and much chillier back room.We looked over the menus quickly and as soon as the waiter showed up we were ready with our orders: one 3-piece for $11 and one 2-piece for $9.25. There is also a 1-piece for $8 for the lighter eater, but cmon, 1-piece? As he hustled off to put our order in we enjoyed some warm rolls with, not 1, not 2, but 3, yes 3 different types of whipped butter (apparently a Coachmans first trial run). About 15 minutes later the bread was long gone and our fish was served.The cod fillets were fresh from the fryer and simply massive, I quickly realized why they have a 1-piece option. The fish tasted good although it was not ultra flaky. It was coated in a semi-light batter which was little firm much like the actual cod underneath. Overall it was good, not but not as great as I had hoped. The straight cut French fries were much the same. They tasted good and were served in a fair quantity but there was nothing really remarkable about them.What was remarkable was the tartar. It looked homemade and was almost straight mayo. It was very good and had just enough of a relish-y kick to put it over the top. It easily made the fish better, but the single silver cup was nowhere near enough for my 3-piece. Luckily for me our waiter friend had no problem offering up an extra.As we were eating we noticed that we were missing a key component, the slaw. Our waiter eventually figured it out and rushed us a couple dishes of the creamy and very tasty side dish. At this point I had almost finished my fish and it was tough to pile on the slaw which made me wish it would have come before the main course since it was actually good. Looking back I probably should have went for the $1 salad bar upgrade which looked well worth it.I cant say I was let down by Coachmans but maybe my expectations were a little too high coming in. The fish was flat out good as were the fries, nothing spectacular, but definitely recommendable. The tartar was great as were the rolls and slaw. To top it all off we had great service from a nice younger dude who didnt mind BSing with some likeminded folks. Overall this Fish Fry is easily recommendable, especially if you live down that way and dont have to drive 30 minutes to get at it. While it may not be a hole-in-one, Coachmans Fish Fry certainly comes in under-par which is good enough for me.www.coachmans.com/?page=6888984 County Highway AEdgerton, WI 53534     (608) 884-8484",3577,0.24405946014769547,0.495688141923436

The Echos been doing it right for years and despite a recent change in ownership has kept chugging right along. The modern day Echo is as good as ever as is their Friday Fish Fry.The Fry of yore was a fish-n-chips affair and just not all that appealing. Todays special actually is special and goes for a scant ten beans. On our recent visit the cod was well friedto say the least. While some would say it was overdone it didnt taste burned and wasnt chewy except for a couple bites near the edges. The batter had a good flavor but wasnt anything that would really blow your mind. Still, it was far better than anticipated based on our previous visits. As a college bar you wouldnt expect house-cut fries or anything like that and the Echos spuds certainly werent. They were just the typical skin-on, food distribution style, but they still did the job. If nothing else, the fat buggers kept the little man happy and that makes them recommendable in our book. Hallelujah! Hallelujah! The Echo has new tartar and were singing its praises. Its no longer a crazy dilly mess, and has morphed into a thick and creamy mayo-relish mix. Its so much better than it used to be and actually overrode the darkened cod to the point where it was almost unnoticeable. That god for genuine tartar! Some homemade slaw with plenty of parsley and other goodies came in a big old cup and while not zippy, was certainly enjoyable. The whole shebang was finished off with grandmas dinner roll which was a welcome sight since it was never even a thing back in the fish-n-chips days. While this Fish Fry was far from perfect I have to give it the thumbs up due to the marked improvement over days past. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and will come back again one of these days hopping for fish that doesnt spend quite as many minutes in the tub.  www.echotapmadison.com/index.php554 W.

The bar is a fun place to hang out, and probably the best spot to grab a cold one after a hockey game at the Kohl Center. Unfortunately, our site is all about fish, and their Fish Fry somehow misses the net every time, and were not really sure why. Its not like we havent given them the benefit of the doubt (weve been there for fish three times now); but for whatever reason they simply dont execute no matter how badly wed like them to. The Echo has recently remodeled and is apparently much more supper clubby than it used to be. While we didnt get that feeling at all, we liked all the upgrades we did notice. They retained the layout, and updated some trim, but the bar has the same general look and feel (which is a far cry from a supper club in our book). Even though it was Girls State Basketball weekend we had no trouble getting a table during the lunch hour and when the waitress came over moments later we ordered some beers and a couple plates of walleye in one fell swoop. The beers came lickety-split, with the fish tailing not far behind.As you might expect with such a short turnaround, the fish was scalding hot, but from the get-go we had our concerns. While we like a light breading this fish appeared to be so lightly breaded it was practically not breaded at all. If any breading did exist, it was subtle and disappeared in the fryer, never clinging to the fish or making it to the plate. Even without its coat the fish was firm enough to be eaten with one's fingers, and somewhat flaky. It tasted of walleye, but since there was no breading or batter to pick it up, thats all there was  semi-dry walleye flavor. While thats not bad, its not necessarily good either. In fact, wed say its a problem.When fish gets dry a thick tartar can go a long way to at least making it palatable. Since we have never been fans of the Echos dill-dominated sauce I was worried we might not have that luxury, but the updates at the downtown bar apparently stretch beyond a few coats of paint. The revamped sauce perked up the worrisome walleye with a much higher percentage of relish than the sauces of yesteryear. While there was still the dill, the sauce was creamy, and gave the fish the huge kick it needed. Further picking up the slack were a The Taps thick-cut wedge fries. These beauties sported a dense, crispy coating, and since they were so thickly cut, stayed hot until the very end. The coating was delicious and had some spice which the bland walleye could have benefited from... As per usual, there aint no bread round The Echo, which left the slaw to fend for itself. Strangely, between the two of us, one of our slaws was dynamite  fresh, and creamy, with a lovely zip; while the others was rancid, and not fit for human consumption. It was odd, to say the least, and made for a less than pleasurable affair (kinda like batter-less fried fish when you think about it). At the end of the day, this Fish Fry is what it is  just not that good. While we dont like that scenario any more than you do that is just the fact of the matter. Sometimes no matter how bad we want something to be great it just isnt. Sorry, Echo. Once again, your Fish Fry is falling on deaf ears. Overall, we just cant recommend this Fry Fry and feel it may have been the last time well try it.www.echotapmadison.com/index.php554 W.

Everyone has one, and most of them stink, yadda yadda We here at Madison Fish Fry realize when we do a review it is just our opinion and that not everyone in the world will share it. We heard recently that we had really missed the boat on our previous visit to the Echo Tap. We were hearing claims of greatness, but all we seemed to recall was decent homemade cod, with a seriously dilly tartar sauce, and some underwhelming sides. According to these sources we were misled, and needed to put the Echo back on our radar. I was planning on a return visit to the Regent Street Retreat, but when Gabe put a blip on my screen and said he could get away for lunch I figured we might as well give the Echo their chance at redemption since he was the one hearing most of the claims. I swung by and grabbed him in the USS-Fish Fry, and found a spot on the street outside the Echo a couple minutes later. We docked our vessel and ascended the handicapped ramp into the dimly lit bar. Unbeknownst to us prior to our arrival, one of Gabes co-workers (FQ) and his favorite bartender (JG) were also enjoying some lunch at the Echo this Friday, so we grabbed a couple stools and joined them (whether they wanted us to or not).JG and FQ had already ordered, so when the waitress lady came over Gabe just ordered himself a Fish Fry and a Cow, and I did the same. The Fish Fry is actually billed as Fish n Chips (at least during lunch time) so I was kind of expecting exactly what we got. Our friends burgers and fries were ready about 5 minutes after we showed up and our fish came about 7 minutes or so after that. When it came out the fish looked very good although the lack of bread made it a little less glamorous.For $7.25 your Fish n Chips consist of 3-4 pieces of hand battered cod, fries, tartar and coleslaw. The fish and its batter were both actually good. The cod was light and flaky as was the batter which had a nice flavor. If the fresh tasting fish wasnt clue enough, each piece was oddly sized so you know it is homemade and not some pre-battered crap. On the whole the fish wasnt spectacular, but was better than I remembered. Unfortunately, the tartar was exactly as I remembered. While it is homemade, it is dilly as all get out, and did not improve the fish one bit. In fact, the fish actually tasted better without it.The steak cut fries were very good and incredibly hot when served. The only problem was that there were only a handful of them which ran out on me in no time flat. The slaw also ran flat quickly as my tiny cup of the finely chopped delight was gone in 2-3 spoonfuls.Of course, the Echo runs their Fry under the guise of a Fish n Chips which is a great way to weasel you out of a piece of bread. Unfortunately for them, I find bread to be an absolute necessity at a Fish Fry and this lack of starch hurts their score, much like it did Mulligans last week. Hey guys, this is Sconnie, not merry ol England; lets drop the n chips add a fry and give me that piece of bread, for god sakes. The Echo touts their Friday Fish Fry as reliable and I guess I cant really refute that: good fish, good fries, no bread and a reliably awful tartar sauce. Overall, this Fish Fry is barely recommendable in my opinion due to a couple major shortcomings with the bread and the tartar. Dont get me wrong, it is definitely a cool bar and a great place to hang out before or after a game at the Kohl Center, but lets not get ahead of ourselves and call their Fish Fry great. Good fish and good fries alone do not a Fish Fry make.As we left the bar I could hear a faint reverberation in the back of my brain: no bread, dilly tartar, no bread, dilly tartar, no bre Lousy echo. www.echotapmadison.com/index.php554 W.

They offer us hope, a fresh chapter, and optimism for the future. In this way weddings are a lot like Fish Frys. Every Friday we have the opportunity to write a new page, take that next step, and grow our knowledge. When it came time for Gabes wedding we put our idyllic notions of prenuptial Fish Frys on hold figuring that rehearsal dinners and our favorite Wisconsin tradition often didnt mix. We were wrong... sort of.It turned out that the rehearsal plans were pretty informal, simply involving a reservation at the Downtown Great Danes lovely outdoor patio. Whats more, in their desire to keep it simple, the gracious couple allowed us to order whatever we wanted off the regular menu rather than limiting our options to a few selected dishes. And guess what the regular menu consists of on Friday? Thats right, Fish Fry! On Friday the Danes everyday fish-n-chips is usurped by a full-fledged Fish Fry which has a few different options, among them a common cod and couple different preparations of walleye. I thought it over briefly, but settled on the Walleye Fry. Initially I had my worries that our large group would lead to soggy fish since coordinating that many entrees can be difficult (a fate we have previously succumb to at the Dane). Thankfully we were spared, and the two walleye fillets were freshly fried and clearly didnt sit under any heat lamps. They were nice and hot, and LOOKED fantastic. Their appearance was bolstered by what appeared to be a heavily-seasoned batter and the fact that you get two small fillets in lieu of one massive one. The walleye was high quality, featuring a flaky texture and mild flavor. Unfortunately, the thick batter just didnt deliver. While the creamy coating looked spicy it came off bland and held in grease like a wet rag. The resulting fish was totally edible, but underwhelming to say the least.While we divorced ourselves from the fish we had no problem entering into a long-term relationship with the Danes Pub Fries. The super spuds were thick and perfectly cooked. They kept things interesting with a little season salt here and there, and took a lot of the focus of the woeful walleye. The tartar was also marrying material as the thick sauce housed a real zip to go along with the other miscellaneous stuff in it. We didnt enter into any sort of binding contract with the coleslaw and its a good thing we didnt. While we didnt end up loathing the creamy concoction, our lifestyle simply wasnt compatible with it. When it comes to slaw we need a spark - something to keep us interested, and any initial attraction quickly wore off. If there is one thing that can end a marriage it is when your spouse pays more attention to your buddies that they do to you. For some reason the Walleye Fry was forced to endure this exact shoddy treatment. While its pan-fried pal comes complete with a dinner roll, the deep-fried dish gets the shaft and receives no bread whatsoever. It is a real kick in the junk, and pretty much the straw that breaks the camels back when it comes to the Walleye Fry. At this point we filed papers. While Gabes marriage is sure to endure all that life can dish out, the same cannot be said of the Danes Fish Fry. While the good times (the fries and the tartar) were very good, the bad times (no bread with the fish and too much batter on the fish) were too much to bear. Overall, we dont recommend the Fish Fry at the Dane even when served on their scrumptious outdoor patio. On the other hand, Gabe and his lovely bride easily garner the MFF seal of approval and we have nothing but the best wishes for our friends as they trek into uncharted waters. www.greatdanepub.com123 E.

Since the game was at 7 I probed him as to whether he was interested in getting an early Fish Fry for dinner beforehand, and he was. I knew we would have some people in our group who would not be getting fish so we needed to find somewhere near the Kohl Center that had good fish and good alternatives. We settled on The Great Dane because it is relatively close and I heard they switched their Friday special to Lake Perch from Walleye. It turned out that two of the tickets fell through so we didn’t end up going to the game but we decided to go to the Dane anyway.The Friday Fish Fry at the Dane is somewhat pricy at $14 but about what you expect for the ambiance of a downtown establishment. The Beer Battered Lake Perch tasted good but the batter was incredibly thick and rich and slightly over the top. When it arrived I wondered if the three “butterflies” would be enough, it turned out with the thick batter it was more than enough. It reminded me of the batter they switched to at the Orpheum recently. It is good, but a bit much, and really doesn’t leave much room for the taste of the fish.If there was one thing I expected it is that the French fries would be good, and they were. The Dane’s fries are thick and straight cut with just the right amount of salt. In fact when we ordered the Fish Fry I don’t think there was even a potato option or if there was our waiter assumed were we all getting fries and didn’t even ask. The tartar sauce was fine but was definitely unique. There was some red onion in it was well as some dill and/or parsley, but none of them dominated the flavor.Last week I was shocked when we went for fish and we didn’t get any sort of bread with the Fish Fry. Apparently the Dane follows this same model and does not serve bread standard with the Fish Fry. I was informed by my fellow diners that the have very good “beer bread” at the Dane and they probably don’t give you any with your fish since they figure you will be buying some of it anyway. I think a Fish Fry should be served with bread regardless of whether there is other good bread on the menu or not. Just throw me a bone and slap a piece of bread on there, whatever it is.  The portion of coleslaw served with each Fish Fry dinner was immense although it did not really taste very good. It is clear that they use high quality ingredients but it just did not come together well which is kind of how I felt about this Fish Fry overall. The Fish was good, but the batter was overdone. The tartar was good but could have been simplified. This seems to be a case of trying to “class up” the Fish Fry which hasn’t fully worked. When it comes to Fish Fry the K.I.S.S. method seems to be the best philosophy. Just keep it simple.www.greatdanepub.com123 E.

In the event that I have a Fish Fry I really like, I simply cant wait to go back and try it again, and usually seize the first opportunity to do so. This is exactly what happened at Montys Blue Plate Diner.Id just had the Friday Night Fish Fry at Montys a couple weeks prior to this trip, and was pretty much blown away. Everything was simply superb and when Jer insisted that we go back for lunch I was inclined to oblige. We showed up this go-round and had a slightly different experience than my pervious visit. Im not gonna lie, it was different, a little worse, but still good in the grand scheme of things. Near as I can tell, Montys features the same fish for lunch and dinner since it costs $9.30 regardless of which number the little hand is on. It is a 2-piece affair and (in theory) comes with all the standard accoutrements. Our waitress was a little slow (by Montys standards), but delivered our fish in acceptable shape. I could tell immediately that this cod was different than the fish Id so loved a month prior. Not only was it colder than the other fish, it seemed to have a different batter altogether. The current coating was not as thick, but somehow heavier than the airy outer layer of yester-fish. It was a totally different style and lacked the spicy character I was expecting. The fish itself also seemed to be cut differently (very small), although it was still clean and flaky. All in all it was okay, but the prtion is pretty small and I think theyd be wise to bump the whole she-bang up to $10 and slap another piece of fish on there  theyre competing with the likes of Alchemy after all In lieu of the standard Julienne-cut fries I went waffle this time around, and it was a smart move. The potato-y grids were a huge improvement over the regular fries, coming in crispy and flavorful. This abundance of spudliness tagged along with a unique flavor of Montys homemade tartar that was also a departure from what I expected. I say a flavor because this tartar was a totally different incarnation that what Id enjoyed last time. This brew still creamy, but had huge chunks of red onion and dill pickle in it. It was a bit over-the-top, and while interesting, was not smooth, and did not aide the cod. Keeping with the departure theme we landed on what was most surely the most glaring difference on this visit - the total absence of bread. While we loved the loaf Montys provided last time, this time it was apparently not meant to be. The fresh slaw made up for it somewhat, but was a little dry, and fairly forgettable. Maybe our first visit was a mirage or maybe I just set my expectations too high, but once Id had a great Fish Fry at Montys I expected it to be consistently amazing. After this visit Id have to that its not meant to be. Everything took a step back, and while it was still very good, it was nowhere near Top 25 good. Overall, I still recommend this Fish Fry, but not as highly as I did only a month ago. When it comes to Fish Fry consistency counts, and this time it didnt add up to greatness. 20089 Atwood AvenueMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-8505",3222,0.13604056437389772,0.48791125883718467

The most famous diner in our fair city is lauded over for it vegetarian-friendly cuisine, its beautiful baked goods, and its groovier-than-average atmosphere. For these reasons  and many more - they are about as busy as it gets, packing the patrons in all day, every day. I figured that arriving 7:30 on a Friday night would land us on a wait list a mile long, but by some benevolent twist of fate I was off way off.There were four or five prime tables open and we got our pick of the litter. At this point I was beginning to think that maybe Montys was slipping and werent drawing them in like they used to. Luckily, I it appeared that we just hit a lull, and by the time we departed all the tables were full and there was a line out the door, but I digress. We were here for the Fish Fry, and thats what youre here to hear about..The Friday Fish at Montys runs a reasonable $9.29 and comes with all the fixings (at least at dinner time it does). Our orders went in and came back within five minutes, freshly fried and ready to be devoured. And devour I did.Since the fish was too hot to handle (too cold to hold, call the Ghostbusters and theyre in control) I jumped into the coleslaw pool first. I was greeted with a sweet and zesty blend that was clearly made fresh in-house. While not the creamy mayo-laden variety you expect at most supper clubs, it was light and fresh  just the kind of A+ offering youd expect from Montys. The dinner roll that sat atop my mound of French fries was also above average, clocking in with a lovely crust and doughy interior. The staple starch presumably comes with a lot of things at Montys and it is nice they decided to include it with the Fish Fry. A truly superb tartar was thick enough to cling to the fish, but still gave way to gravity, leaving the fish with a perfectly even coating.  It was a remarkable blend, featuring a peppery kick and a few ancillary items in addition to the traditional mayo and relish. While this kind of thinking outside the box can easily ruin a tartar these noteworthy additions actually enhanced the flavors rather than detracted from them. The sauce played remarkably well with the fish, augmenting its spicy batter with a zesty sweetness. Speaking of the cod, it was nothing less than outstanding and far exceeded my expectations. At first glance I thought the fish was doomed to fail as it had what appeared to be a thick and heavy batter  the kind known for trapping grease and turning a fine fish into a big old wet sock. Luckily for yours truly looks were deceiving in this instance. The thick batter was amazingly light, and fall-apart flaky. In addition, it was fried absolutely perfectly  crisp, but not to the point where it totally bubbles off the fish. Whats more, it had a tremendous flavor that was creamy, but still delicate. The beautiful batter fully engulfed the fish, but didnt overpower it. The actual cod was clearly high quality flaky cod, but the cuts were somewhat thin (minor complaint). The only downfall to this Fish Fry (if there was one) were Montys regular French fries. While certainly not bad in any way, they just didnt have a unique characteristic on which to hang their hat. They are basically the kind of fries that get that exterior shell that salt will not stick to. While it is slightly frustrating to not be able to salt them heavily it is probably healthier overall so I cant judge them too harshly for it. If nothing else, the portion was simply huge and lasted to the very end  bonus points!!!I have actually wanted to try the Fish Fry at Montys the longest time, but was never willing to bite the bullet. The bullet in this case being the tilapia fingers they served instead of cod. I have yet to meet a fried tilapia I actually like, so, I waited, and waited, and waited some more. Thankfully, Montys came to their senses and brought back the cod we fell in love with on this trip. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and will likely be back before long. 20089 Atwood AvenueMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-8505",4144,0.1715120274914089,0.5319442241607191

People either seem to love their sports memorabilia laden walls or loathe warehouse-like feel of the vast space. The kitchen also seems contentious as some love the simple bar fare, while others write it off as low quality and slapdash. I fall somewhere in the middle, and think the food (at least the Fish Fry) is reasonably tasty, and the bar itself is interesting. Of course, as a sports fan that is to be expected.As recently as November 2013 Pooleys kitchen was under the supervision of Diggitys  a hotdog specialty shop that had a commendable Fish Fry. Since then a newcomer has commandeered the ship, in the form of Kipps Kitchen. Kipps brought a whole new menu to Pooleys, along with a whole new crop of Friday Fish specials including: Cod (beer soaked), Catfish (also beer soaked), Walleye (baked or fried), Tilapia (baked or fried), and a House Specialty Smelt (1/2 lb or full lb). Since I was hungry, and you dont find it everywhere, I manned up and went for the full pound of smelt which comes with a side of Sidewinder fries. Since I beat the lunch rush by 15 minutes my order hit the kitchen without delay and the fish came out quickly. The smelt was certainly abundant, but didnt look like a full pound to me. There were probably 15 or so of the petite fish which varied slightly in size. They featured a substantial breading that really covered up the fishy flavor of the smelt, but still tasted good. It was almost exactly like the smelt at 5100 in McFarland, which is passable, but not quite as enticing as some of the other smelt in the area. The sidewinder fries that slithered alongside the smelt were an interesting lot to say the least. They were almost cottage fry-style, and were very tasty although non-uniform. There were thick chunks sprinkled in with thin chunks, dotted with a few over-fried nubs. By and large they were tasty and brought a welcomed balance to the basket. A thick and chunky tartar rode shotgun and clung to the smelt with herculean force. It had just the right consistency, and a nice pop, but was a little heavy on the dill pickle for my taste. A rye roll was the bread of choice, and was very dense but also very chewy. While I normally appreciate rye, this number was a little over the top and the last bite was so crusty that it couldnt even be eaten. It was a real gnawer. Last on the list was some house-made slaw that was creamy throughout but overwhelmed by a green pepper essence. While people either seem to love or hate Pooleys I dont find it to be such and all or nothing affair. The cod at Diggitys was good, and the smelt at Kipps is just fine too. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry, and will probably be back to try the walleye, cod, or catfish one of these days.

Now I work out near American Family and Pooleys is right there. I think Ill be going there a lot. There are a lot of similarities between the two sports bars, but the one that matters most to me is their fish. Lets compare on contrast the two.Both places serve cod on Fridays. Wilsons cod is flaky, lightly breaded, well-seasoned, and holds together extremely well. Pooleys cod is equally flaky, and perhaps even more seasoned, but has a much crumblier breading that falls apart (usually in the tartar). Slight advantage to Wilsons. Both places serve French fries standard with their Fish Fry. Wilsons fries are Sysco-style, Julienne-cut, and have never blown me away. Pooleys fries are equally Sysco-y, but of the crinkle-cut variety and served in a much heartier portion than Wilsons. Advantage to Pooleys. Obviously, both places serve tartar with their fish. Wilsons tartar is the nectar of the gods. Its thick and creamy, with the perfect pop. Pooleys tartar also has some pop, but is much thinner. Its also homemade and has much more dill and real chunks of pickle in it. While its good enough, the advantage goes to Wilsons. Both places give you bread with your fish (which all places should do, but many dont). Wilsons roll is the standard soft, squishy, dinner roll that is usually fresh and welcoming. Pooleys always has some sort of pumpernickel-rye bread (either roll or an actual slice) that is more traditional and really adds something to a Fish Fry that is lacking otherwise. Advantage to Pooleys on this one, although it is close. Both places serve coleslaw with their fish, and there is a clear winner here. Wilsons slaw has always been underwhelming, with very little zest, and a strange chalky flavor. Pooleys slaw is made in house, is always fresh, and has a good balance of flavors. While its not as creamy as Wilsons slaw it is still better. Advantage: Pooleys. While Pooleys takes three of the five categories, Wilsons takes the two that matter the most: the fish and the tartar, and gets our nod as the better Fish Fry. Thats not to say Pooleys is far behind as both are borderline highly recommendable Fish Frys. Overall, we recommend Pooleys and like I said, I think Ill be going there a lot in the near future. www.pooleysmadison.com5441 High Crossing BoulevardMadison, WI 53718     (608) 242-1888",2442,0.17720858134920633,0.4125297619047618

Pooleys is the place for you. If you love Fish Fry (and who doesnt?) same deal.I showed up this Friday hoping to try Pooleys new bluegill, but found out its only available at dinner time so I was forced to settle for the cod (which isnt all that bad if you have to settle for something). I had a plate of steaming hot fish in front of me within minutes of ordering and got right down to business. The cod comes as a 2 or 3-piece and I, of course, got the big one. Each of the three pieces featured Pooleys special breading which is incredibly flaky, heavily-seasoned, and really quite scrumptious. While the fish itself isnt pristine (a little greasy here and there), it is still flaky and works really well with the crumbly breading. Its the total package as far as fried fish goes, save for the fact that the breading is so crumbly and the fish so flaky that it has a tendency to fall apart in the tartar. No big deal though, thats why God invented forks. Speaking of the tartar, its alright, but not thick enough for my tastes. It also has a little too much real dill in it, and while its not off-putting it doesnt do much for the already spicy fish. That said, I still used almost all of it. I also ate most of the French fries even though there were a ton of them. The flock of fat crinkle-cut fries took over the far side of my wax paper lined basket and were quite satisfying. They were saturated with seasoned salt and peppered with parsley flakes, which wound up being a little overkill, but still much better than no seasoning at all. Bolstering the lineup was a whole slice of pumpernickel-rye bread which was lightly toasted and heavily delicious. It was just right and complemented Pooleys homemade coleslaw perfectly. While the slaw wasnt super creamy, and there was some slaw-water to deal with, it was fresh, and sweet with a perfect zippiness. While I wasnt able to get my bluegill fix this Friday, I still had a great Fish Fry at Pooleys and thats all that really matters. Overall, I recommend this Fish Fry and appreciate that Pooleys puts in the effort to do it right (which is more than I can say about a lot of places).

Thats all youre getting Sorry. Quick $9.50 3-piece for lunch. Fish took longer to come out this time, but there were a few more groups than my previous visits, so that is to be expected. Food was hot, but not scalding. I could tell it sat for a second b/c I heard he bell ding twice before it showed up. Everything was still good, but a step back from the previous visits. Cod was fine, but not as spicy, and breading was thicker. Also a couple of translucent-looking flakes of fish under there. Fries lacked the seasoning weve become accustomed to, but were plentiful. Tartar was loaded with big pickle chunks and tasted fine, but wasnt smooth. Roll was same pump-rye, but a little crustier on the bottom than expected. Slaw was really colorful, but lacked zest  didnt eat it all. Perhaps we overvalued Pooleys after two surprisingly good visits? Overall, its still recommendable, but not highly. Think Ill probably come back and try the all new bluegill although I hope its not as thickly battered as the cod www.pooleysmadison.com5441 High Crossing BoulevardMadison, WI 53718     (608) 242-1888",1142,0.09662296037296035,0.3814568764568765

I didnt want to deal with any sort of rigmarole this Friday, and since my last visit to Pooleys went swimmingly, I decided to just hop on that ship again. On my first trip Pool-side I wasnt sure what to expect so I sunk into the 2-piece cod instead of indulging in the full-fledged 3 banger. This time I jumped in feet first and took the $9.50 3-piece plunge with no reservations since I knew how exactly how deep the water was going to be. The sports memorabilia warehouse that serves as Pooleys was quiet during the Friday lunch hour, and just like last time my food arrived in the blink of an eye. The cod and fries were steaming hot and looked just right situated next to the big cups of coleslaw and tartar sauce in the classic wax-paper lined red plastic basket. The fish was so hot that I actually had to wait a moment before I could handle it comfortably, but once I did, it was just how I remembered it. It features a crumbly and heavily-seasoned breading that gives the cod with a real jolt. The fish itself was flaky, albeit slightly greasy. However, the errant oil didnt saturate the breading resulting in tasty fish that made quite a splash. A mammoth portion of French fries filled the bottom of the basket, and formed a luxurious bed for the cod to loaf around on. Like the fish, the fat, crinkle-cut fries were seriously spicy and practically drowning in seasoning (in this case what appeared to be Old Bay). A heaping dish of tartar constituted the deep end of the basket and gave the cod a noticeable leg-up. The homemade sauce was creamy, and relatively thick, but had a ranch undertone that I just couldnt shake. Its mayo-mate, the tartar, was fresh and colorful, but like the fries had an Old Bay blast that threatened to drag it under. Thankfully the fresh cabbage component, and creamy goodness of the mayo were enough to keep things afloat. Drifting along the baskets surface was a fresh pumpernickel-rye roll. The dark brown bun was a little firm on its flat bottom, but remained buoyant. It paired nicely with the slaw and took a little of the Old Bay edge off. Its always risky to dive into unfamiliar waters, and when I came to Pooleys for fish a couple weeks ago I played it safe for that reason. After a second visit I can say with certainty that things are all clear at the east side establishment. Overall, I highly recommend the Fish Fry at Pooleys, and will no doubt be back to swim in these waters again soon. www.pooleysmadison.com5441 High Crossing BoulevardMadison, WI 53718     (608) 242-1888",2687,0.10344761904761901,0.3588420634920634

You know what Im talking about  you really want to go somewhere or do something, but based on your preconceived notions of the place or event you just cant quite bring yourself to do it. Enter Pooleys Fish Fry.Ive known about Pooleys/Diggitys Fish Fry for a long time, but had a bad meal there ages ago and assumed the fish would just be more of the same. I put it off, and put it off, until I pretty much forgot about it altogether. Then one day, out of the blue, I got a push from one of the staff members, saying that we didnt know what we were missing. What we were missing turned out to be a really good little Fish Fry. I arrived at noon, and the humungous bar was deserted, save for a couple older gentlemen wolfing down lunch. I grabbed an open stool, ordered a beer and some fish, and within 5 minutes had them both  a nice start on a slow lunch hour. The fish at Ps/Ds comes as a 2-piece for $7.50 or a 3-piece for another couple bucks. Since it was lunch and I was still skeptical, I only went for the 2-piece, but regretted my tentativeness after the first bite. The fish was really great, and featured a light and flaky breading which was a little thick, but not obtrusive. The crispy coating was crumbly and well-seasoned, and played nicely with what appeared to be high quality cod. It was very yummy, and after mowing down the two I could only wish I had that third one. Lots of crinkle-cut fries came along for the ride and were loaded with season salt and what appeared to be parsley flakes. While the standard spuds are usually nothing special, these were expertly fried, and generously portioned. As far as freezer-to-fryer crinkles go, they had to be some of the best I can remember ever having, and believe me, Ive had my share. A thick and tasty tartar drove the fish home, and featured a strong mayo base, but just enough relish and dill to jazz it up. The homemade coleslaw was also pretty jazzy, but maybe a bit too much so. It was loaded up with Old Bay (or some such seasoning) and the strong spice dominated the flavor. While it wasnt bad it wasnt primo either. Last, but not least, was a nice little pumpernickel/rye roll which did exactly what it was supposed to do  serving as a nice change of pace between bites of fish and fries. What can I say? Sometimes we get pushed into situations we dont want to be in, and other times we find something great that we would never have known about otherwise. Overall, this is an easy Fish Fry to recommend, and probably highly so.

It stems from our fathers, and our fathers fathers. Generations of Wisconsinites have observed the special Friday tradition, and here at Madison Fish Fry we are honored to be a small part of it. We have enjoyed the experience of each and every Fish Fry, from the very best to the very worst, and everything in between. We have eaten more fried fish than we once imagined possible, and consumed more calories than is probably advisable. This Fish Fry commemorates the 500th entry in the Madison Fish Fry database. That is 500 individually ranked Fish Fry options from almost 200 different restaurants. From local lake perch to imported Icelandic cod, The Esquire Club to The Club Tavern, I guess you could say that we have been there, and done that. Since it was kind of a special Fish Fry I figured what better way to commemorate it than paying a visit to one of our local veterans halls. I have known the VFW on Cottage Grove Road has had a Fish Fry for quite some time, but only recently heard that it was worth checking out. The Fish Fry faithful and I pulled into their cramped parking lot around 6:30, and were not the least bit surprised that nearly every stall was full. As we entered we were greeted by a rowdy bar, enveloped by thirsty patrons on this muggy Friday evening. Jer paused to grab us a pitcher of Spotted Cow, while Gabe found the hostess and procured us a table in the mess hall. We were seated, browsed the menu for a bit, and a few geriatric moments later a member of the ladies auxiliary ambled by to take our orders. Gabe and I both went for the cod while Jer opted for the ocean perch. Our fish came no more than 10 minutes later and was nice and hot, as it should be. I snagged up one of three tiny pieces and instantly and let er rip. The fish was nice and light as was the batter it hosted. The flaky cod blended well with the delicate batter resulting in very tasty fish. A one-for-one swap allowed me a glimpse at the ocean perch as well. It was also very delicate, and enjoyed what appeared to be the same batter as the cod. It was equally good, if not even a little better than its deep-sea companion. Overall, the fish options were both very appetizing, but left me wanting more after Id exhausted my tiny allotment of three skimpy pieces. Accompanying the fish was a thick tartar which was insanely heavy on the relish. Now, I normally like a thick, relish laden sauce, but this was a little over the top and took too much attention from the fish with its flamboyance. The amount of attention taken by the tartar was equal to that given away by the plain-Jane crinkle cut fries.  They were a straight-outta-the-bag variety and nothing special, much like the hash browns with cheese and onions, tried by both Jer and Gabe. Gabe seemed to think they were decent, but Jer swore up and down that they were rancid or had been befouled in some way. I gave them a whirl, and thought they were definitely not good, but werent nauseating or anything like that.Completing the Fish Fry puzzle was some basic French bread and some very cabbagy coleslaw. The bread was largely forgettable, but the slaw was fairly tasty even though it was cut into near perfect cubes, which was kind of creepy. While this wasnt quite the stellar unheralded Fish Fry that I was hoping it would be for our 500th, it was still really good. Overall, I feel very confident recommending it, especially at a mere nine bucks. The fish was delish, while the fries and tartar did just enough to save face. Some bread, some slaw and a no-nonsense atmosphere helped to get the job done. While the service wasnt exactly crackerjack (the ladies auxiliary aint no spring chickens after all), it was familiar and welcoming which made for a great visit when all was said and done.  As arteries clog, and Fish Fry after Fish Fry goes by we think about how what a long strange trip it has been. Never would we have imagined 500 plates of fish would pass these lips.

It stems from our fathers, and our fathers fathers. Generations of Wisconsinites have observed the special Friday tradition, and here at Madison Fish Fry we are honored to be a small part of it. We have enjoyed the experience of each and every Fish Fry, from the very best to the very worst, and everything in between. We have eaten more fried fish than we once imagined possible, and consumed more calories than is probably advisable. This Fish Fry commemorates the 500th entry in the Madison Fish Fry database. That is 500 individually ranked Fish Fry options from almost 200 different restaurants. From local lake perch to imported Icelandic cod, The Esquire Club to The Club Tavern, I guess you could say that we have been there, and done that. Since it was kind of a special Fish Fry I figured what better way to commemorate it than paying a visit to one of our local veterans halls. I have known the VFW on Cottage Grove Road has had a Fish Fry for quite some time, but only recently heard that it was worth checking out. The Fish Fry faithful and I pulled into their cramped parking lot around 6:30, and were not the least bit surprised that nearly every stall was full.

Don’t get me wrong, I like it enough, but when you compare it to regular batter it is just too much usually. Last week we went to the Great Dane, naturally their fish was beer battered and really heavy. I wasn’t really in the mood for more beer battered Cod at this soon after but when I saw the menu at Tully’s II and realized they had Lake Perch as well as Cod I figured it was worth a shot. Tully’s II is located on Monona Drive near the beltline on Madison’s southeast side. The place looks small from the outside but once you get in it is actually quite spacious and bright. Right when you step in the door you see the bar located directly in front of you with dining rooms to either side. Separating the two dining rooms and somewhat far away from the bar was a kind of game room, complete with pool tables, phoos ball and the like. This room seemed slightly out of place but I bet if you had kids with you it would be a godsend. According to their menu, Tully’s II is the “Best Fish Fry in Monona”, so I felt like we were at least in for a good meal.The AYCE Beer Battered Cod at Tully’s II is $10.00 while the Beer Battered Lake Perch is only dollar more and also AYCE. I went for the Lake Perch for the reasons described above and was also able to try the Cod. The same beer batter was used on both types of fish and was good but definitely thicker than your average non-beer batter. The fish itself was good, with the Cod being slightly better than the Lake Perch. Overall this was actually probably some of the better beer batter I can remember, I give them points for that. Even though it was AYCE I was only able to eat 3 pieces, partially due to the thick and creamy batter and partially due to the salad bar you get before hand.Usually when you get Fish Fry you are served a side of coleslaw, like it or not. Tully’s II goes beyond and includes the AYCE salad bar with their AYCE fish which is nice. The rolls which were available on the salad bar were just your average style buns but tasted just fine when paired with the whipped butter on the table. The French fries were somewhat disappointing. The delicious looking shoestring style fries were a little cold and not as plentiful as you would hope for at an AYCE. The tartar sauce was good though even if it was just a big squeeze bottle hanging out at the table. The service at Tully’s II was fine. It seems to be a family run operation with a few dedicated folks running the whole show. If I am ever in the mood for a good AYCE Beer Battered Fish Fry, or if I have friends/family in town that are big beer batter fans I would not hesitate to go to Tully’s II.

Since my girlfriend wasnt in the mood for fish on this particular Friday I thought this would be a good place where she could find something on the menu that did suit her tastes. The Cannery Grill is located in appropriately enough, Cannery Square which must be a redeveloping area of Sun Prairie. The building is pretty cool and mixes the old brick and beam aesthetic with modern styling. The place is huge when compared to more traditional restaurants around Wisconsin. The Friday Fish Fry specials consisted of 3 or 4 piece Cod, Lake Perch or Walleye (pronounced Wool-Eye by our waitress). I opted for the Lake Perch since I had Cod for lunch but I did manage to wrangle a piece of my friends Cod off his plate. Both styles of fish were good, but not great. The Perch was much better than the Cod as it actually had some flavor. The Perch had a fairly good texture and decent flavor to the batter. It was not heavy and sat very well in my stomach after we left. The cod on the other hand was certainly edible but lacked flavor overall and had a firmer texture to it. It wasnt very tender or flaky and overall just not that great. Unfortunately I think our fish sat under a heat lamp for a little bit before it was served to us as it wasnt burn your face off hot which may have detracted slightly from the overall experience. If you are going to choose, definitely go for the Perch. Although I didnt try the walleye I saw someones order of it and it looked huge. The French fry option was for straight or curly cut and I went for regular straight. The fries actually tasted pretty good, but only received a score of Good from me due to the fact that they were slightly mushy and not served hot; they could have easily been Excellent. The tartar sauce was good as well but had a very distinct taste of sweet relish which was slightly over the top. Since I opted for the clam chowder I didnt get any bread which actually looked very good. The salads that everyone else got looked very good. The service was good and the waitress visited our table several times during the meal to see how we were doing.I think I would be able to highly recommend the Perch here if all the elements of the Fish Fry would have come together a little better. The fish and fries were not super hot and all the periphery items were just okay. Also, in a place as new and fancy looking as the Cannery Grill you come to expect extreme cleanliness. This was certainly not the case as everything was a little dirty, especially the floor around the table next to ours. Overall I think this is a decent Fish Fry.

http://madisonfishfry.com/reviews.php?restaurant=149,http://madisonfishfry.com/reviews.php?restaurant=149&event=1223,2017-12-29,Mariner's Inn,"Overall, I would highly recommend this Fish Fry.",Excellent,Good,Good,Good,Good,"Take-out is never the best option when you are talking about a Fish Fry. First off, a big part of any Fish Fry is ambiance - getting out of the house and welcoming the weekend with some drinks and camaraderie. Second, and most importantly, fried food (especially fish) doesn't travel well, and when it's trapped in a Styrofoam container it essentially gets steamed leading to soggy, mushy, and generally unappealing fish. For these reasons and more it's best to eat your as fish as soon after it's fried as possible which means sitting down at your favorite restaurant or bar for an hour or so and making an event out of it. Take-out should really only be thought of as a last resort, but it's the path we had to take this Friday.I was only a week and a half removed from arthroscopic knee surgery and since there was no real way to go out to a sit down restaurant comfortably I had to take my medicine. I knew I'd be relegated to take-out so I took everything into consideration and decided that walleye and fries from Mariner's Inn was the best choice. MI is only about 3 minutes from our house so I knew travel time would be minimized, and I knew that the walleye would be breaded rather than battered and likely not soften up as much on the short journey. We also had some friends coming over and I figured the kitchen would be doing some order juggling so I wanted to be sure my fish had as much wiggle room as possible. Clearly coordinating 6 meals in a to-go order is going to take some effort, but in general things arrived in fine shape. The walleye was a real deal, big-old fillet that looked superb despite the few minutes it spent in transit. The fat side of the fillet was a good inch and a half thick and home to the perfect walleye flavor. It seems like forever since I've had a genuine piece of walleye and I really missed that taste especially when it's paired with the exceptionally crispy and well-seasoned breading Mariner's applies to it. I was ripping seems, tearing planks apart, and loving every sticky, finger-licking bite. While it was though to do, I shared some with my fellow diners, and they agreed - this is the good stuff. I also dipped into the haddock and thought it was good but not quite as alluring as the walleye. The ""fingers"" were on the thin side, and cloaked by a pale batter that had a pleasant flavor. Four come to an order, and while they are significantly cheaper than either the walleye or lake perch at $14, I'd still splurge on either freshwater fish at $20. Whereas everyone took a liking to their respective fish, the reviews on the tartar were mixed. Some thought it to be a bit boring, but I for one like a mayo dominated combo. I will concede an up-tick in the relish contingent of 10% or so would liven things up a bit and add little variety, but the walleye was so good on its own that the basic sauce served as a fine accompaniment. Since the haddock was a little more plain, I can see where a more diverse sauce would really perk it up so this is essentially a case of using the right sauce for the right fish, I guess. My order of steak fries were battered and likely crispy when they came out of the fryer but I'd guess they were one of the first things fried because the small handful was lukewarm upon arrival and had lost its edge. Other's orders apparently still had the crunch so they must have been fried and boxed after mine. Oh well, it was no fault of their own and still a nice rendition which was much better than the standard fat supper club Julienne cuts. Putting an exclamation point on the meal was a banger of a slaw that was ultra zippy but not overwhelming. It wasn't creamy, but not really vinegary either. It wasn't crunchy, but far from soupy. It was just seriously tasty, balanced, and literally some of the best slaw I can remember having recently. A selection of white and pumpernickel rolls were there to pick through as well, and made an impression on everyone...""They even sent the bread!?"" All things considered this was an amazing take-out experience. Fried food typically doesn't travel well, so we are really lucky to have a place like Mariner's so close to our home. Sure $20 is a lot for a Fish Fry, but under these circumstances I'd do it again in a heartbeat. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and will think of Mariner's more often when we want to stay close to home. www.marinersmadison.com/5339 Lighthouse Bay DriveMadison, WI 53704     (608) 246-3120",4458,0.19026483781918557,0.5339216701173224

Not only was it hard to find a spot in their huge parking lot, but there was always a significant wait at the relatively tiny bar. It was such an ordeal we stopped going and figured we’d just fight the crowds elsewhere. Well, something has changed, or maybe we just hit them on an off night, but these last two Fridays things were slower, like waaaaaay sloooooooooower. Great for us!We actually used their on-line reservation system, but when we showed up at 6:30 it was clear that forethought wasn’t at all necessary. The parking lot was sparsely populated allowing us to walk right in and have our pick of tables. Of course, being that we had free reign, junior picked a high top in the bar area near the restrooms which was likely the least desirable spot in the whole place. Rather than fight that battle we just went with it, but seriously, just typical. Regardless of that situation, the service in there was great and the food quickly made us forget about the poor choices toddlers make.Mariner’s has lake perch, cod and, walleye available on Fridays, and since I’d never had it I spring for the $20 perch. Before the fish found us a steaming hot napkin-lined basket of pumpernickel rolls and other breads did. The pump-rye was really outstanding and so hot that the butter liquefied on contact creating a molten river atop the brown buns. It sounds as amazing as it tasted.These days you see a lot of places peddling “perch” and uninformed patrons go ahead and order it assuming it’s the traditional yellow perch. Far too often it’s not, with pike-perch or ocean perch sitting in its rightful place. Places like Mariner’s know the drill, and while they need to charge a bit more for it, stick with the real deal. Their portion is made up of seven fillets that are home to a light and crispy breading with just enough seasoning to let you know it’s there. Our lot was perfectly prepared and served as hot as can be. It was a rousing rendition and made us want to run right back in for more the next week.Mariner’s touts their hash browns and when I hear boasting like that I feel the need to make them back it up. Sure it’s an extra buck-fifty, but if they are as good as they say they are then that cost should be well justified…and it was (but almost wasn’t). My plate came sans-browns initially as a bevy of battered steak fries took charge. These spuds were super crunchy and generously portioned but had me soured on the thought I might miss out on the hash browns. But lo and behold the hash browns did appear eventually, and since they were tardy we didn’t even get charged for them. Two potato sides! Needless to say I was in heaven. Tons of caramelized onion lorded over the spud cake and almost tasted sugary. They were special, and not like any I’ve had before. They were so unique it was difficult to describe, but essentially took things up a notch which is all I was expecting them to do.The tartar came in a clear ramekin and had a good zip, but wasn’t as supper clubby as expected. Regardless, it was thick and creamy and complemented the already alluring perch just as it should.Keeping with our recent run of seductive slaws was Mariner’s brew. This batch was some of the best we’ve had recently which is saying something since we’ve had some good ones – see Avenue Club, and Freddy Valentine’s. It had the zip we love and an enticing vinegar essence that made for easy eating. It was obviously made in-house so you can bet there are no big Sysco jugs of slaw sitting around the kitchen.I’m sure there will be some dissention as $20 isn’t a cheap Fish Fry by any means, but man, this baby has it all. From the thoughtful service, to the genuine lake perch, to the signature hash browns, I felt like my cash was well spent and think well be dropping more dough there again real soon. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and think this is one mariner who takes the sea(food) seriously.www.marinersmadison.com/5339 Lighthouse Bay DriveMadison, WI 53704     (608) 246-3120",4101,0.19022243107769424,0.5347671261487053

Well, something has changed, or maybe we just hit them on an off night, but these last two Fridays things were slower, like waaaaaay sloooooooooower. Great for us!We actually used their on-line reservation system, but when we showed up at 6:30 it was clear that forethought wasn’t at all necessary. The parking lot was sparsely populated allowing us to walk right in and have our pick of tables. Of course, being that we had free reign, junior picked a high top in the bar area near the restrooms which was likely the least desirable spot in the whole place. Rather than fight that battle we just went with it, but seriously, just typical. Regardless of that situation, the service in there was great and the food quickly made us forget about the poor choices toddlers make.Mariner’s has lake perch, cod and, walleye available on Fridays, and since I’d never had it I spring for the $20 perch. Before the fish found us a steaming hot napkin-lined basket of pumpernickel rolls and other breads did. The pump-rye was really outstanding and so hot that the butter liquefied on contact creating a molten river atop the brown buns. It sounds as amazing as it tasted.These days you see a lot of places peddling “perch” and uninformed patrons go ahead and order it assuming it’s the traditional yellow perch. Far too often it’s not, with pike-perch or ocean perch sitting in its rightful place. Places like Mariner’s know the drill, and while they need to charge a bit more for it, stick with the real deal. Their portion is made up of seven fillets that are home to a light and crispy breading with just enough seasoning to let you know it’s there. Our lot was perfectly prepared and served as hot as can be. It was a rousing rendition and made us want to run right back in for more the next week.Mariner’s touts their hash browns and when I hear boasting like that I feel the need to make them back it up. Sure it’s an extra buck-fifty, but if they are as good as they say they are then that cost should be well justified…and it was (but almost wasn’t). My plate came sans-browns initially as a bevy of battered steak fries took charge. These spuds were super crunchy and generously portioned but had me soured on the thought I might miss out on the hash browns. But lo and behold the hash browns did appear eventually, and since they were tardy we didn’t even get charged for them. Two potato sides! Needless to say I was in heaven. Tons of caramelized onion lorded over the spud cake and almost tasted sugary. They were special, and not like any I’ve had before. They were so unique it was difficult to describe, but essentially took things up a notch which is all I was expecting them to do.The tartar came in a clear ramekin and had a good zip, but wasn’t as supper clubby as expected. Regardless, it was thick and creamy and complemented the already alluring perch just as it should.Keeping with our recent run of seductive slaws was Mariner’s brew. This batch was some of the best we’ve had recently which is saying something since we’ve had some good ones – see Avenue Club, and Freddy Valentine’s. It had the zip we love and an enticing vinegar essence that made for easy eating. It was obviously made in-house so you can bet there are no big Sysco jugs of slaw sitting around the kitchen.I’m sure there will be some dissention as $20 isn’t a cheap Fish Fry by any means, but man, this baby has it all. From the thoughtful service, to the genuine lake perch, to the signature hash browns, I felt like my cash was well spent and think well be dropping more dough there again real soon. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and think this is one mariner who takes the sea(food) seriously.www.marinersmadison.com/5339 Lighthouse Bay DriveMadison, WI 53704     (608) 246-3120",4101,0.19022243107769424,0.5347671261487053

We have been to Captain Bill’s a few times, The Nau-ti-gal a few more and The Mariner’s Inn even more. The last time we went to Mariner’s Inn for Fish Fry I got the Cod as was less than impressed. I thought that their other options had to be better so we decided to make a return trip to test this theory. I’d had the Baby Walleye at the Nau-ti-gal and knew it was on the menu at Mariner’s too, and that it was supposed to be damn good. We arrived at Mariner’s at 8pm or so and were able to be seated immediately. Since it was the day before Valentine’s Day we were handed the Special Event menu which was devoid of any Fish Fry. I nearly panicked and was more than willing to get up and leave but was reassured by the waitress that the Fish Fry options were still available even thought they weren’t listed. Whew. I went for the Baby Walleye for $17 instead of the Lake Perch and was not disappointed. The Walleye came about 15 minutes after we ordered and looked splendid. There were 5-6 full butterflies served on their own plate which were lightly fried and delicious. The tartar sauce that accompanied the filets was equally delicious but not quite enough. I asked for another cup and solved that problem. The French fries came on their own plate and were awesome. They were straight cut and fried with a seasoning or something that gave them a crispy outside. Superb. Before the fish we were treated to Mariner’s lovely basket of warm rolls and a side salad which was good but nothing to write home about. Last trip to Mariner’s the service was above reproach. This visit was a slightly different story. Our waitress wasn’t bad but just didn’t have it all together. It wasn’t enough to ruin the dinner but having to wait for every little thing starts to wear on you over the course of the meal. Overall this was a good Fish Fry, but for what you pay you expect a little more. Mariner’s is an “upper crust” kind of Supper Club and everything is clearly high quality but you definitely pay for the ambiance and reputation. There is no doubt this is a good Fish Fry but it is definitely on the higher end price wise, the food is great however so you can slice that pie any way you want. www.marinersmadison.com/5339 Lighthouse Bay DriveMadison, WI 53704     (608) 246-3120",2414,0.32697835497835487,0.5523290043290044

We have been here several times in the past, but never on a Friday night. The cod was somewhat chewy and didn't have a very nice batter. You actually get 3 pieces with dinner but I could only handle 2. The French fries were very good, lightly seasoned and thick cut. The bread was served warm which is very nice, try the pumpernickel. The coleslaw was actually very good (for coleslaw). The best part about the meal was the service. It was kind of a slow night due to the fact it snowed all day so our server was very attentive and even made some great suggestions for dinner. Next time I will certainly try the Lake Perch or the Baby Walleye instead.

The fish came fast, almost too fast. It was three minutes and a cloud of dust. The lunch special at the MSB is only a 2-piece deal, but also only costs $7.50 so its a good deal. The fish hit the fat part of the plate and was good, not great. It was basically exactly what I expected it to be. It consisted of two smallish pieces that were probably 3 oz each. The fish was of decent quality, and was a little watery but maintained some flakiness. The average cod featured a light batter with enough flavor to cover the imperfections in meat. In a word it was every bit of average, but still perfectly recommendable in our book. Alongside the fish was a decent portion of thick-cut Julienne fries that were perfectly cooked and had a satisfying crunch. A rich creamy tartar was also satisfying, and clung to fish even though fish may not have wanted it to. Some really good slaw and a regular dinner roll rounded out the meal and did all they needed to do. The slaw was of the creamy variety and had a good punch to go along with its milky consistency. The roll was a roll, plain and simple. While the Fish Fry at the MSB isnt something to go out of your way for it is a fine little Fish Fry. Overall, we barely recommend this Fish Fry, but for the price you really cant go wrong. www.sportbowl.com6815 University AvenueMiddleton, WI 53562     (608) 831-5238",1455,0.2102721088435374,0.5755991627420199

Since MFF is nothing if not a savvy consumer, once we read the fine print and realized that it said nothing of Friday-exclusions, we jumped on it. I mean, cmon. $15 for what amounts to four Fish Frys? Thats a seriously good deal.We corralled the troops and hit the Sport Bowl right during the lunch rush. Even so, we still had our pick of several tables and what would prove to be a very attentive waiter. The lunch Fish Fry at the MSB runs $7 and features two nicely sized pieces of cod, a fair amount of fries, and the rest of the standard sides.The food came about seven minutes after we ordered and was piping hot. Wasting no time, I lunged cod-ward and sunk my teeth in. The flaky fish was pretty good, but for some reason totally missed Jer. He was underwhelmed by the semi-thick beer batter and only ate one of his two pieces. Luckily, I was there to fall on that grenade and swallowed up his abandoned fry posthaste. While even I was not blown away, the fish lacked grease, had a nice flavor, and was just very solid in general. The fries on the other hand were much better. The julienne-cut potatoes were the battered variety and perfectly fried. Their crisp exteriors gave way to supple interiors making for an idyllic side. Reviews of the tartar were mixed, but  the sauce itself hardly was (mixed, that is). The homemade MSB blend was almost straight mayo, and while it missed Paco completely with its lack of zip I found it to be more than acceptable, especially when you compare it to some of the dillier sauces we have experienced.Standard rolls and so-so slaw rounded out the meals and while neither was a show stopper, both did what they needed to do.When all was said and done our wonderful waiter brought the check (a whopping $3 after our $30 Groupon), and we all had a chuckle. Sure, it wasnt the best Fish Fry we have ever had, but it just may have been the best deal we have ever gotten. $15 for $30 worth of food at the MSB!? If you ever see that one again, buy that baby and take it to the bank. Overall, this is an easy Fish Fry to recommend at the normal price, more or less at half-price.

It truly was the place where everybody knew your name. These kinds of bars are few and far between, but after a few visits I have to say that the Middleton Sport Bowl it is that communitys version of the famous TV tavern. Every time I have patronized the Sport Bowl the service has been really fast and incredibly friendly. The older gentleman working behind the bar is the Sam Malone of this place and really does seem to know all the locals. He runs the show and makes sure everyone feels at home and gets their fair share of tasty grub, and while Im not sure if he is the owner, I would put my money on it. He is Ted Danson reincarnate, although with a few more miles on the tires. On Friday the Sport Bowl has a 2-piece cod special for a mere seven clams during the lunch hour. Most places only do Fish Fry, and while I would never personally get it, Im sure others appreciate that they do have the baked option is available. I sat at the bar by my lonesome, and ordered a 2-piece from old Ted. It arrived from the kitchen no more than five minutes later and was nice and hot, as it should be.  Since I am not one to beat around the bush, I quickly parsed out my items and slammed a piece of the cod home. The MSB cod is beer battered and really good. The batter was a little thicker than I like it to be, but was by no means heavy. It was also surprisingly greaseless which is a rarity in beer battered cod. The actual fish was light and flaky and could still be tasted under its beer infused sheath. While the portion wasnt huge, it was lunch appropriate, and fair for the $7 price tag. On the side was a pile of fries which sported a crispy coating. They tasted great and were likely homemade, although some good imitators could have fooled me. Regardless, if they taste good, they taste good, and these did. The tartar was also superb and was plentiful enough to make it through the two pieces of fish and into the remaining fries. The sauce was mayo-centric but did have enough relish to keep things interesting. The standard dinner roll was less interesting, but was fresh at the very least. The coleslaw was also fresh and clearly homemade, although not really very tasty. It was a creamy variety of slaw, and looked good, but lacked the zip that creamy slaw needs. Overall, this is an easy Fish Fry to recommend. All the elements of a standard Fish Fry are there and done relatively well. The fish, fries and tartar are all tasty, while the roll and slaw do their jobs adequately. The quick service and clean establishment are what really put this seven dollar fry into the easily recommendable strata though. While food is not out of this world, it is highlighted by good service and pristine surroundings which add up to a quality Fish Fry when all is said and done. I am certainly not a regular, but with good food at a good price maybe I should become one? Heck, maybe MFF could be the Norm of the MSB? Then again, maybe not yelling Fish! doesnt quite seem to have the same impact as Norm! Well have to work on that.www.sportbowl.com6815 University AvenueMiddleton, WI 53562     (608) 831-5238",3149,0.25997066942719116,0.5187442267877053

I was meeting my lady for lunch and I knew she would not be interested in fish so I needed to pick somewhere in Middleton that has good food beyond Fish Fry. Even though we went to the Middleton Sport Bowl a couple weeks ago it was so good that I figured we may as well do it again.I arrived at the Sport Bowl right at 11am and my grabbed a table. My special lady showed up a little while later and we put our orders in. The Friday special at the Sport Bowl is straight forward, 2 piece cod with fries and slaw for $7. The food came about 10 minutes after we put our order in and was hot as can be. The cod was not as good this time as it was my previous visit. The pieces were smaller and a crispier and what I assume were “end pieces”. These pieces tend to be a little darker in color and have a firmer, sometimes chewy texture. They were still good mind you but not excellent.The French fries were spot and I think I lost about 1/3 of my portion to my girlfriend. The tartar sauce was also great and more than plentiful for the two pieces of cod. The coleslaw they serve looks homemade but certainly doesn’t taste like it. In fact, I went to the Owl’s Nest in Poynette for dinner and believe that they had the exact same slaw. It isn’t terrible, and it looks nice because they cover it with poppy seeds, but it is just not tasty. The roll served was your plain-Jane standard dinner roll but perfectly fine.Overall, this is definitely a tasty little Fish Fry. There does seem to be a small issue with the consistency of the cod but it really isn’t too bad. The French fries and tartar always seem to be right on the money though so that does help to improve the overall quality. The portion size is great if you have plans to do a physical activity after lunch but if you are looking for a heaping mound of fish or AYCE you should probably look elsewhere. This is good fish, for a good price and unlike an AYCE you won’t need to sleep this one off.www.sportbowl.com6815 University AvenueMiddleton, WI 53562     (608) 831-5238",2140,0.21272522522522522,0.47532175032175045

It was never enough to get me in the place but it was enough to make me aware that it was around. About 3 years ago or so the Sport Bowl was remodeled and went from a drab looking block building to the glass faced behemoth you see before you today. It was at this point that I actually visited the Sport Bowl and realized that it is indeed a bowling alley, and a pretty nice one at that. In addition to bowling they also have a nice kitchen which serves up tasty grub and one mean Friday Fish Fry.The lunch Fish Fry special consists of 2 long filets of deep fried Cod, served with French fries, tartar sauce, coleslaw and a roll for $7. The Cod was great, even better than I remembered it being on my previous visits. The fish must have come directly from the fryer because it was so hot it was not even edible. The batter was light and flaky as was the Cod. Looking back I noted that it tasted slightly cinnamon-y , but I didn’t notice it this time in the least. Great fish.The French fries were delicious too. Straight-cut and fried perfectly, they complimented the fish about as well as can be expected. I was also blown away at how good the tartar sauce was. It seems like they went to Wilson’s and figured out the exact same recipe. It was fantastic. The roll was a very traditional dinner roll which was soft and tasty and rounded out the important elements nicely. Coleslaw is of less importance to me but when you only pay $7 for a Fish Fry that is probably going to be the side you get. The coleslaw was homemade looking but just didn’t taste very good. Oh well. I was slightly taken aback by the MSB this visit. I knew it was good but this was more than I was expecting. The newly remodeled bar/dining area is very nice and with the high ceiling cigarette smoke is almost unnoticeable. The servers were friendly and punctual and did a great job of getting the fish out as soon as it was ready. It turns out this is practically the perfect lunch time Fish Fry. It is very straight forward but every element (save maybe the coleslaw) was dead on. The portion size was just right for lunch as was the price.

Unfortunately, these activates were to take place outside and it happened to be pouring rain so we had to put these plans on hold. Regardless, we still had to get Fish Fry and since we had planned to meet some friends in Cottage Grove we decided to have dinner at the Black Bear Inn.The Black Bear Inn is actually kind of a neat place. It has a nice big bar and a good sized dining room that has a sort of Northwoods cabin feel. We arrived at 7:30 and had no problem getting seated immediately even though we had a semi large group of five. We got a round of drinks, looked over the menu and got the special relayed to us by the waitress.The Friday Night Fish Fry consists of either thee or six pieces of beer battered cod. The six piece will run you eleven bucks while the three piece is only slightly cheaper coming in at $9. I went for the six piece because I was fairly hungry, but it turned out the three piece would have sufficed. The fish was okay, but I would not say I enjoyed it. The beer batter was dark, firm and a little too crispy. It tasted okay but didnt really leave me wanting more. I am not a huge fan of beer battered fish in general and this stuff did nothing to dissuade me. The cod itself was better, somewhat flaky but a little too greasy.The French fries that accompanied the fish were good but not great. They were fairly standard, straight cut potatoes with no real character. They were also not very hot which is always a bit of a let down. The tartar sauce had a good consistency but was a little too sweet for my tastes. Instead of coleslaw we got a soup/salad bar option and I went for the Clam Chowder, which was decent but unremarkable. In addition we got a nice sampler-style basket of breads which were all warm and tasty; this basket may have been the highlight of the dinner. Overall this Fish Fry was just not quite good enough to recommend. Everything was just a step below where you would want it to be except for our waitress who was pleasant and attentive and did a very nice job. Regardless, good service cant make up for a subpar Fish Fry. I dont think we will be back to the Black Bear for fish any time soon.320 W.

What's that, you say? FFF? That's nuts... But it's true. Changes in ownership, changes in cooks, changes in distributors, changes in philosophy, and even changes in wait staff can have dramatic impacts on the quality and consistency of a Fish Fry. Of course, change can be a good thing too (see our most recent review of the Whippoorwill Tavern), but a recent change in ownership has altered the Fish Fry at Utica Bar, and not for the better I'm afraid to say. When it was Mitch's Utica Bar the Fish Fry was quietly on of the best Satellite Frys out there. It was well worth leaving mother Madison and venturing into orbit for, but sadly with Mitch's blasting off his recipe and his fish frying technique went with him. What's left is decent, but just not the same.The fish out in Utica is still cheap ($10 for a 3-piece with extras for $1.50 each), but a shell of its former self. There are also shrimp and clams available on the menu so if you're feeling frisky there is some diversity there. It was pretty busy this Friday and took the lone waitress a bit to find us milling around the bar and grab our order (they do it Toby's style here - you hit the bar first, the waitress finds you there, you place your order with her, then you're seated when there's a spot open and food is ready). It took all of 90 minutes to get to our table which left plenty of time for cheap Old Styles and Rum Chata shots with said waitress, Elisa (it was her birthday - she was lovely). As soon as we sat down I could tell things were different. The plate looked pretty boring. The pieces of cod were relatively small (maybe a couple ounces each), and not of the highest quality. They were home to a leathery batter that had no seasoning to speak of. While I was hungry enough to eat all four pieces it wasn't because they we great, but more because I'm used to eating much earlier these days. Several spud choices populate the concise menu, but all three in our party went for the ""funeral potatoes"" based on Elisa's recommendation. Of the four options (fries, baked, and potato pancakes among them), these hash browns are the only truly homemade one and reside in a fryer-side Nesco roaster. They are clearly made by hand, with plenty of cheese mixed in. The gooey goodness saturated our souls and made up for the middling fish to some extent. Being finger-fed bites of them by the Elisa's mother beforehand is another story... Solo cups of tartar sat to the side and I got two of the skunky sauces with my 4-piece. The mix was thick, but the relish contingent was prominent, and stuck out a little too much in my opinion. The cup 'o slaw was the next size up and fine, but little else. Strangely, there was only one roll in the basket for our table making it feel misplaced, or more than likely, Elisa just grabbed the wrong basket from the kitchen. Either way it was just a plain roll, and I'm sure we could have had more if we'd wanted. While this may all sound negative plenty of positive changes have come with the new ownership at UB as well - the wait staff and bartenders seem more friendly and outgoing, and they have a nice new outdoor patio area. The Fish Fry has taken a serious downturn however. Overall, we don't recommend this Fish Fry, and are holding out hope they can turn it back around. Maybe they need to pick Mitch's brain, or bring him back as a guest chef of Fridays? It's also worth noting that Utica Bar is still cash only, but they do have and ATM if you're forgetful. 2167 County Road WCambridge, WI 53523     (608) 423-3522",3639,0.11482196482196484,0.48983512733512724

While it isnt always apparent exactly how they do it, the best just do, and when you eat one you just kind of know it. Its really as simple as that. Nothing more than a county crossroads, the tiny village of Utica boasts one of these truly special little Fish Frys. Mitchs Utica bar is basically out in the middle of nowhere, and although it is close to the interstate, it isnt close to any on-ramps. This insulated location helps keep the out-of-towners at bay, and ensure a strong following from the locals. For those of us not from the outer limits of Stoughton or Cambridge the tiny tavern is out of the way, and somewhere you probably wouldnt go without a good reason. Luckily, for us theres a great one. For a mere $9.75 Mitch pitches out 4-piece cod dinners, complete with all the trimmings. Dinner in Utica is a pretty straight-forward affair, and it all starts with a stiff Old Fashioned or a cheap beer at the big old bar. As you enjoy your drink the seemingly omnipotent waitress will come out of nowhere to grab your order - only seating you in the dining room when its ready. Ours took a good 45 minutes to an hour, but that just gave us more time to have a couple drinks, inquire about the eggs in the beer cooler, and play the jukebox. Once summoned, it took my eyes a second to adjust from the dimly-lit bar to the even more dimly-lit dining room, but when they did what they saw was awe inspiring. A full-stocked table awaited us, complete with steaming hot plates of fish, a huge bottle of tartar sauce, and a basket of warm rolls. We drank it in, and got to business. Im not sure the right term even exists to describe Mitchs beer battered cod, so Ill just go with scrumtrulescent. The fish was unbelievably light and flaky, and incredibly delicate. I plowed through the four small pieces with no problem and thought the 2-piece option they offer must have been a joke - I easily could have eaten two, if not ten more. The main reason the fish is so good is the beer batter, which has to be the thinnest beer batter out there. It is seasoned perfectly, and plays with the elegant cod rather than overpowering it. While every bite of fish was 100% pristine, it wasnt 100% delicious thanks to the amazing batter. My god scrumtrulescent. Mitchs cod can easily be eaten with or without tartar, but do yourself a favor and use it. The Utica tartar is superb and pairs perfectly with the fish. It has lotsa mayo, and just the right amount of relish, with no other BS to cloud the mix. It might sound boring and basic, but this is about as good as it gets when youre talking tartar. Continuing the gooey greatness is Mitchs coleslaw. Its rich and creamy, with just the zest you want in a slaw. The elongated white bread buns, offset the cool brew nicely, and are easily perked up by plenty of room temp butter. If anything is lacking at the UB its the potato options. While there are a ton of spuds to choose from, they are all processed, and uninteresting. Since there were three of us we got to try a few varieties, of which, the French fries were by far the best. They were the thick-cut Julienne variety, and were well-fried and hearty. The potato pancakes our friend Sean got were just little pre-formed hash brown rounds (basically Potato Olés from Taco Johns), and come with packaged syrup, or apple sauce for $0.50 ea. (which probably isnt worth the up-charge). The actual hash browns were also of the pre-formed variety, and were just like the rectangular patties that come in the big log from the grocery store. Like the rest, the hash browns were fine, but mostly thanks to the $0.50 cheese and onion upgrade.The only detractor to our dining experience in Utica (other than the so-so spuds) was the dude at the table behind ours. While the last time we came we got to sit next to the funny dad who was celebrating his birthday with the family, this time we got Joe Asshole. This jerk was literally berating his wife about eating like a cow in front of the whole dining room. It was totally out of line and while it didnt ruin our dinner altogether, it is something we wont soon forget. What a dink.Despite the dink, this was another great trip to Utica. If youre willing to make the trek to the southeast youll be rewarded with one of areas truly special little Fish Frys. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry, and will have to make it a point to get to Utica more often  its more than worth the drive. And to answer their self-imposed question: Where the hell is Utica Bar? Fish Fry heaven, thats where. U-ti-ca!

I had been waiting to get to the Utica Bar for a couple weeks but since it was either too far, or “too bar” I was unable to make it. This Friday I put all my cards on the table and told the misses that we MUST go to Mitch’s Utica Bar or I would definitely lose my mind. She concurred. Getting to Mitch’s Utica Bar is pretty simply really. Just take the interstate towards Chicago and get off on exit 147 (Hwy N). Follow N about 2 miles south and take a left on Hwy B. Follow B until it hits the Bar on the corner of B and W. It is a good 15 minute drive once you are out of town but it is well worth it, let me tell you.From the outside the Utica Bar looks like a standard bar that you would find at any rural intersection in Wisconsin. Once inside it is not a whole lot different. There is a good size bar, which we were able to get three stools at rather easily, a few tvs and the usual bar atmosphere. Since it is Utica, and not Madison, patrons are welcome to smoke which for me only enhances the ambiance. There are no menus at the Utica Bar. The food options are written on the black felt boards with the little white press-in letters and do not change from what I could gather. I avoided the top 2/3 of the board and looked straight to the bottom where the “Friday Menu” was listed.We came to Mitch’s Utica with one idea in mind and that was a delicious Fish Fry so that is what we ordered. The only choice was cod, although I think there were some other non-fish alternatives like clam strips and shrimp. We ordered at the bar and waited for our spot in the “dining room” to be ready while watching CC Sabathia destroy the Nationals. That guy is good, probably almost as good as the Fish Fry we were eagerly awaiting to enjoy. After about ten minutes our waitress was back and gave us directions to our table. When we sat down everything was ready and waiting for us. We wasted no time and immediately began to devour our spread. The cod was simply delicious with no weird tastes or textures. It was not as screaming hot as it could have been but all my pieces we hot enough. The crinkle cut style French fries were also great, exactly what you should expect at a bar Fish Fry. The tartar sauce, while sitting in a big squeeze bottle at the table, was also delicious; I would say it was almost perfect although being at room temperature. The basket of bread was okay but the buns were somewhat dry and flavorless. Lastly, there was an option for coleslaw or cottage cheese and I opted for the cottage cheese which was alright, but I overheard on of our fellow diners comment on how great the coleslaw was and I immediately had buyer’s remorse. Next time, the slaw.The table next to ours was a family out celebrating Dad’s birthday, and Dad was half in the bag. It was hilarious and provided the perfect ambiance for a Fish Fry at a bar. We overheard him several times saying “I have the best family,” and I had to agree with him because any family that would go out for Friday Fish on Dad’s birthday to the Utica Bar must be the best. The best bar Fish Fry for the best family, that is the way it should be.Overall Mitch’s Utica Bar was awesome. This is probably the best Fish Fry I can remember having at a bar. The big three items (The Fish, The Fries and The Tartar) were all phenomenal and the periphery items were all perfectly acceptable. $9.25 for a four piece Fish Fry? You can’t really ask for much more.2167 County Road WCambridge, WI 53523     (608) 423-3522",3506,0.29474206349206344,0.46436507936507965

When I showed up this Friday at 20 after 12 the entire parking lot was jam-packed which made me a little uneasy. With so many people in such a small space I wondered if Id even be able to get a spot at the bar much less a good plate of fish, but I went with it cause what else was I really gonna do?Luckily for me, there were a few open spots at the bar so I settled right in and got myself a beer. After some deliberation I chose the walleye over the cod or lake perch since they were all beer battered and I got (semi-) burned by some beer battered lake perch the previous Friday. All the fish options were cheap (in the $7.50-$8.50 range) so regardless of what I chose I felt like I couldnt lose. I definitely didnt. The kitchen at the DH was pumping out food left and right and I had my order within about 7 minutes. Surprisingly, or maybe not, the walleye plate was just the right amount of food for lunch. It housed one medium-sized walleye fillet, a handful of waffle fires, a big Solo of slaw and a small one of tartar. While there wasnt a roll on my plate, I did see some sitting on the counter which made me think they were available upon request (I wish theyd just come be default). I never did get one. Usually when I get a hunk of walleye I like to tear it down the seam to release some of the internal steam and make it more manageable, but with the beer batter completely covering the perforation it simply wasnt possible. I instead just ripped the tail end off and worked my way up with my fork. Even though it was tough to handle, the walleye was delicious. As youd like to see, the fish was flaky and pure. It didnt have any odd flavors, but even if it did the yummy beer batter would have masked them. The coating was very tasty, but still light and airy. It had a minimal amount of grease, and totally stole the show. While I usually like a light, well-seasoned breading, this beer batter didnt spoil the mellow fish one bit and I can only imagine how well it would pair with the cod. Adding even more allure to the meal were some well-seasoned waffle fries. The portion was plentiful and the sublime spuds actually approached the level of waffle wisdom you find at Dexters Pub. They were most impressive. A thick and tasty tartar came along for the ride and complemented the fish perfectly. It was rich and creamy with just the right amount of relish to keep it interesting. The slaw also kept my attention as the finely-chopped, homemade-looking mix had the ideal amount of horseradish on the back end to perk it up. Despite the fact that the joint was packed I was in and out in around 30 minutes which was very impressive. It had everything to do with the well-coordinated kitchen and waitstaff which operated as one cohesive unit rather than a bunch of separate entities. One person took my order, another dropped off the fish, and yet another cleared my dishes. It was a true team effort. Overall, I highly recommend this Fish Fry, and think its a one heck of a bargain at a mere $8.50. All for one and one for all seems to be an appropriate motto for the Draft House, and when youre talking Fish Fry thats a great place to start.

The food turned out to be very good and more or less put Verona on the map for me Fish Fry wise. There are some other newer bars in Verona which are reminiscent of the 5th Quarter, one of which is the Draft House. We have known about the Draft House for while but just never quite made it down there on a Friday. Since I anticipated a 5th Quarter like experience I decided this was the day to make the trek with a couple friends in tow.We arrived in suburban Verona around 12:30 and rolled into the crowed parking lot. The Draft House is a sizeable establishment with a separate dining room and bar area. We moseyed into the bar and grabbed the lone available table. As we waited for the waitress we glanced around at the many TVs and noted the Fish Fry special. Today the Draft House was offering Cod, Lake Perch and Walleye, all for less than 9 bucks. Eventually the waitress showed up with some menus and grabbed us some beers. The menus weren’t necessary since we were all here for fish but we looked them over anyway to make her feel good. We gave her our orders (two perch and one cod, all with waffle fries instead of regular), and about ten minutes later they were ready. The lake perch was beer battered and was good, but not great. The batter overwhelmed the fish underneath which was actually pretty tasty. In addition there were only 3 tiny filets which is not a lot especially if you brought an appetite. Reports were that the cod was also decent but nothing special.What was special were the waffle fries. They were spicy and delicious and came with a side of ranch. The ranch was offered upon request but must have become the norm since it was pretty much forced upon you whether you want that bastard or not. The tartar was super thick and tasted very good as well, although I’m sure I at least once dipped the fish in Ranch instead of tartar by mistake. The slaw was polarizing due to the hint of horseradish which I liked but others didn’t seem to. One thing I definitely didn’t like was the complete lack of bread with this Fish Fry especially considering the “conservative” portion of fish allotted. Oh well. Overall this was a good, clean Fish Fry that I would recommend to a friend. The service was quick and friendly once we actually got it, the food was good and the establishment was well kept. If you are on the area I would not hesitate to stop by although if you have an extra 5 minutes you might wanna skip down the road to the 5th Quarter.www.drafthouseverona.com/home.html1010 Enterprise DriveVerona, WI 53593     (608) 848-3158",2670,0.19826206673145447,0.5120023174104807

If you're not there by, say, 4:30 on a Friday night you will be waiting for a table, that's just the way it is. You either like it, or leave it, but don't complain about it - it's a Friday night in Wisconsin after all. Thankfully, Springers has a BIG bar, plenty of indoor seating while you wait, pull tabs, bar games, and probably the best part (at least 1/2 of the year) a HUGE waterfront patio with seasonal live music! It's an idyllic setting, with what comes after the wait falling right in line. What comes once you're seated is one of the most expansive Fish Fry menu's you'll ever feast your eyes on. In addition to COD SPECIALS (BAKED COD, LIGHTLY BREADED OR BEER BATTERED FRIED COD - available as a 2 or 3-piece), they are ALSO SERVING: BLUE GILL, CATFISH, GROUPER, WALLEYE PIKE, DEEP FRIED SHRIMP, and COCONUT SHRIMP, in addition to their FRIDAY CHEF FEATURES which this week were: RAINBOW TROUT, MAHI MAHI, LAKE PERCH, ORANGE ROUGHY, TILAPIA, FRIED SMELT AND CRAPPIES (WHEN AVAILABLE). Whew... Oh yeah, there are steak and chicken specials too, in addition to a great kid's menu! With so many options I was incredibly overwhelmed and bopped back and forth between the smelt, perch, bluegill and walleye, eventually settling on the walleye since that's what I'd told myself I was getting before seeing the exhaustive menu. I stuck to my guns at least... The ""WALLEYE PIKE"" runs $20 and, while I should have asked how it was prepared, I just assumed deep fried since the menu didn't specify. While it was fried, it wasn't immersed in oil as expected. This fillet was pan-fried and served on a bed (albeit a very thin bed) of spinach. While it was still good, and meant to be eaten with knife and fork, I dove in as I normally would - with two bare hands. The fillet was smallish as far as walleye goes, and without any sort of breading didn't have a ton of flavor. That said it was moist and flaky and very well-prepared. Oh well, you live and learn... Whereas the fish led me astray the hash browns were all that and a bag of chips. They slippery spuds were expertly fried and capped by a slab of ultra gooey melted cheddar and heaps of coarsely-cut white onion. While a little more care in the onion distribution would certainly have been welcome that's a pretty petty complaint, as they overall flavor was still superb. While the name says nothing of it, Springers is a supper club through and through and they have the traditional tartar to prove it. This stuff is as thick as molasses and measures up to any you'll find. The lakeside location also provides a whole basket of breads to diners before their entrées complete with: rolls, fritters, cellophane-wrapped bread sticks, and cold-pack cheese spread. It's as supper clubby as it gets and makes the Springers' experience so much more. The last thing to mention is the homemade slaw which is a real zinger and landed a punch where my walleye whiffed. Being fixated on one thing and/or making up your mind before you've seen all the options can be a good thing. It shows resolve and the ability to follow through, but you can also get burned, and I kind of feel like I got singed this Friday. Sure, my walleye was still tasty, but not what I was expecting; if able to do it over again I'd certainly pick the perch or select the smelt since those weren't just specials, they were FEATURES! Oh well, as I say, you live and learn and next time flexible will be the name of the game when playing Fish Fry roulette at Springers. Overall, we still recommend this Fish Fry and while I liked it, I'm sure the more health conscious among us would absolutely LOVE it. www.springersonthelake.com/3097 Sunnyside StreetStoughton, WI 53589     (608) 205-9300",3773,0.22725506949191154,0.509175717070454

Then there are places like Springers...Springer's is a Fish Fryin' kinda place and the Stoughton community clearly knows that all too well. When we pulled in just before half past five the parking lot was already overflowing into the neighboring yards, the music was in full swing on the patio, and the locals were loud and loving every minute of it. It was a great scene which was magnified 10 fold by their idyllic setting on the shores of Lake Kegonsa. We put our name on the list, grab a Cow on the patio and romped around listing to Natalie Imbruglia and Doobie Brothers covers. Within 30 minutes our name was called and we headed to the dining room for our feast. Springer's is staffed largely by high school kids, but don't let their ages fool you, these kids are trained to bust ass. Our waitress, who may or may not have been of legal smoking age, was on us in a flash and had another round of drinks and our orders into the kitchen in a jiffy. Lazy Millennials my eye... SoLK has just about every fish you can fry, but having tried the haddock previously (albeit many moons ago) I felt the need to branch out. I went for the exorbitantly priced bluegill and paired it with a side of hash browns (cheese and onion of course). While the freshwater finsters were far from free the allotment came in large so it wasn't a rip off or anything. Upwards of 10 triangular shaped fillets were  splayed across the plate and definitely the genuine article. Each tasty tidbit was home to light breading, that wasn't devoid of flavor but didn't scream salt either. A pleasing balance was struck and while I'd take a hint more seasoning the portion size was definitely there to make up for it. Truth be told - I crushed those little devils. Springer's puts real cheddar on the hash browns and while I love a good sharp, it just doesn't melt like American does. The crudely cut onions also left a little something to be desired and while they were still good for the most part, they didn't hit home like they should have. While the fish was missing a piece that tartar was there to complete the puzzle. This sassy sauce had it going on and caressed the sunfish every so tenderly, as if to say ""I'm here for you. We got this."" The basket of rolls, cinnamon fritters, cellophane sticks, and cheese spread also pulled their own weight and mostly came home in our to-go box (I know, we're getting old). When you're given the choice between soup, salad, and coleslaw, it's hard to stick with they typical slaw and today I just had to branch out. In all honesty, I probably should have just stayed in my lane as the clam chowder was largely forgettable and overloaded with potatoes. Oh well. Our last visit to Springer's was back in 2009 and I regret that it has taken us this long to return. This is a great Fish Fry and one we should go out of our way for more often...hell they still have walleye and lake perch I've never been able to sample. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry even at it's lofty price point.

I thought it was a great idea since it had been a while since we’d seen them and we were getting Fish Fry anyway. When they suggested Springers on the Lake in Stoughton it sealed the deal. I hadn't been to Springers even though I had known about it for some time and was interested to see what was what. My relatives tried to make reservations for 7pm, but were informed that on Friday, Springers (like most Supper Clubs) does not take reservations. We agreed to meet at 7 anyway and take our chances. Since there were two of us coming from Madison we decided to get there a little early and get our name on the list. We arrived a little before 6:30, accomplished our goal and grabbed a couple beers. It didn’t take long for the Janesville crew to show up, and no sooner had everyone grabbed a drink, than our name was called and we headed to the dining room. On Friday nights Springers offers up a very impressive list of fried fish starting with beer battered or plain battered cod. From here, they branch out to offer: lake perch, walleye, bluegill, rainbow trout, Tilapia and a Mahi Mahi special. Oh, and this particular Friday they were also offering fried Smelt. That is pretty much everything under the sun which gave me a tough choice to make, but since I had freshwater fish earlier in the day I picked cod and went for the plain fried. Once this choice was made the next option for 2 or 3 pieces was upon me; I went big and chose the 3-piece, when, in retrospect, 2 would easily have sufficed.Everyone at our table got cod, but some went for the beer battered variety. After having samples of both styles we concluded that both were good, but nothing special. First, the pieces were absolutely massive, with the beer batter was some of the thickest I can ever remember. The crispy coating was good, but so thick and heavy that it made the fish underneath practically disappear. The regular batter was MUCH lighter, but lacked a unique flavor that the beer batter had in spades. It really would be nice if they could strike a balance between the two. Perhaps some of their other fish varieties have found this middle ground?The “seasoned” French fries I got were good, but nothing outstanding. They were basically straight cut, but with “curly fry” seasoning. There were about 10 other potato options to try as well, and on our next visit we may be inclined to try an alternative. The tartar sauce also fell in a similar category. It was good, but nothing to write home about (at least it wasn’t ultra dilly). The basket of bread served was very nice however, and came with fritters (donut holes) which were almost like free dessert. Score!Since Springers seems to be the restaurant of options it is only fitting that they would give you the soup/salad/coleslaw/cottage cheese choice to top everything off. I went for the clam chowder which was heavy on the bacon, but very average. Overall, this is a pretty good Fish Fry, but I was actually expecting a little more from Springers.  The service was good and the Supper Club itself is actually pretty nice inside (from the outside we weren’t sure what to expect). If, and when, we come back I will try some of their other fish options, but at this point the cod is recommendable.

Weve championed the campus-adjacent underdog for quite some time, but recently they just havent been cutting the mustard. On our previous visit everything seemed to have regressed, but we tried to write it off as a one-time deal. This time, not only did the regression continue, but we had salt poured into the wound with a $1.00 price hike. The once super quick and friendly wait staff no longer exists, literally, theyre gone, as in there wasnt a single person tending the bar except for the cook. It was kind of strange to see him get drinks for everyone then rush to the kitchen to fry five orders of fish. He did an admirable job and we had the fish within five minutes, but still, no waitress?! Sucky.The food suffered a little bit from the lack of focus as the each of the three big pieces of cod were a little over-fried around the edges. Dont get me wrong, it was still decent, and had the same crumbly breading we have come to know, but it was lacking the spice we have come to expect. That spicy breading was one of the things that kept us coming back, and when its gone, so are we. Putting the cooks lack of waitressing prowess on center stage was the fact that he gave us steak knives with our Fish Frys. Perhaps he just meant it to allude to the steak fries that come with the RSR Fish Fry, but for whatever reason we were allowed them. The knives sat idle throughout the eating of the perfectly cooked fries, and while the fries did their part, the knives certainly did not (mostly since there was nothing for them to do).The best part about this Fish Fry was likely the gigantic Solo cup of zesty RSR tartar. The thick sauce was composed of a mass of mayo and a good amount of relish. It made anything and everything it touched more edible, and like the horseradish laden slaw, was rich and creamy, and a force to be reckoned with. Unfortunately, the once lauded Texas toast has totally faded, and while its better than nothing it certainly isnt great. Absence is supposed to make the heart grow fonder, right? Unfortunately in this case, we arent really missing the RSR when we get lunch somewhere else. Sure, it is still good enough, but while the atmosphere has improved with their recent remodel, the food has not. Overall, we will still give them the benefit of the doubt and barely recommend their Fish Fry, but nowhere near as highly as we once did.1206 Regent StreetMadison, WI 53715     (608) 256-7750",2490,0.11710052910052908,0.4971499118165786

Likewise, Fish Fry is not immune to the occasional sub-par performance, and even the most consistent places can have an off day now and again. Unfortunately for us, this Friday our weekly lunch fell victim to just such a fate.We had quite a crew this week, and since Jer had been boasting about the value-loaded Fish Fry at the RSR we had no choice but to convene there. I arrived at 12:15 to find Paco and Christian (of Sonic Foundry fame) seated at their own table, while my co-workers, Reese and Matt, sat a few feet away, both duos blissfully ignorant of impending meeting. I quickly coaxed them into joining forces and our league did what we could to cobble together a table big enough for our party of six. The waitress came by a while later and grabbed our orders  Fish Fry all around. She scampered away, returning moments later to distribute the sodas that come included in the $6.50 price tag. All was normal for the time being, but we were about to be thrown for a bit of a loop. The first hurdle we encountered was a longer than average wait. I chalk it up to the fact that rather than one or two fish plates, the cook had to coordinate six at one time; but instead of the usual 3-5 minute fry time, we didnt get our food for a good 10 minutes. It was no big deal, since when it finally appeared it was nice and hot. I cracked into one of the three pieces of fish instantly, and was greeted with something different than what I was expecting. We hit the second stumbling block. For some reason the breading that is normally salty and unique, lacked some spice, and left a bland taste in my mouth. Whats more, one of the pieces was not flaky and was actually tough to chew. It was unpleasant, to say the least, and seemed to have been forgotten in the fryer. The other two pieces of fish conformed to the RSR standard, and were light and flaky, and tasted fine despite the lackluster breading they hosted. Pairing with the single chewy piece, and tripping us up even more were the steak fries. While we have come to enjoy the thick-cut fries immensely, they were overcooked, and didnt enjoy the same fluffy/crispy contrast we have come to expect. Even the delicious RSR tartar, which is incredibly thick and generously portioned, could not pull these fries from obscurity. The final hiccup was attributed to the Texas toast. Usually, the thick slabs of grilled bread are well above your average dinner roll, but today the pieces were pintsized and a little burned. Not cool. While the crispy toast, substandard fish, and flawed fries missed the mark today, the RSR homemade slaw was dead on. The crisp cabbage concoction was incredibly creamy with just a hint of horseradish to perk it up. It was served in the same, larger than average, cup as the tartar sauce and salvaged the meal in some regard. The best among us are not immune from a bad performance, and it is inevitable that once in a while a Fish Fryer will not bring his A game. Today was just such a day at the RSR. Overall, this Fish fry is still recommendable, but if this had been our first visit to the RSR we likely would have thought long and hard about a return visit. Luckily for us, we have been there and done that, seeing the RSRs true colors in the process. Before you make a call on the RSR based on this synopsis, please see some of other (glowing) reviews to get a taste for a normal Friday at the RSR. Well give them a shot at redemption before long and still recommend that you do too. 1206 Regent StreetMadison, WI 53715     (608) 256-7750",3619,0.06653439153439154,0.4985271672771671

Well, there are those of us out there who think that simply wont do, especially when there is another perfectly good meal on Fridays where Fish Fry can be featured. Of course, we are talking about the fabled lunch hour Fish Fry. Over the years we at Madison Fish Fry have had the pleasure to work some of finest folks in Madison (at least in our opinion), and broken bread with them for the midday meal more times than we can count. We recently accepted a different job and with it came a new group of coworkers. When the new crew asked if they could tag along during our Friday ritual we took them up on it, if for no other reason than we are always looking to spread the Fish Fry love. We figured wed start our gang of greenhorns off at The Regent Street Retreat since it is a whale of a deal, and right in the neighborhood. We have written time and again about our affinity for the RSR Fish Fry, and figured this was a perfect opportunity to let our new friends in on one of the best kept Fish Fry secrets in Madison. After spending a mere $6.50, and getting more food than they could eat, we think that Doug, Reese and Dan would agree. As per usual, there was no wait at The Retreat, and the food was served by the friendly waitress within five minutes of placing our orders. The three generous cod fillets were so hot my anxious fingers could barely handle them as they were plucked one by one from the bed of fries which cradled their delicate bodies ever so lovingly on their short trip from fryer to belly. I quickly polished off two of the three flaky fillets, thoroughly enjoying their silky texture, and crumbly breading until the very end. My rapid gorging kept almost any grease from settling, although during a short hiatus to exhaust the RSRs signature slaw and Texas toast, a tiny bit of clear, clean, oil did sogify a scoch of the breading. Filling out the plate was a copious cup of tartar sauce, and a generous portion of thick-cut steak fries. The RSR tartar is incredibly creamy, and boasts a zesty kick that improves almost everything it comes in contact with. When the capable cod met this splendid sauce a match was made in heaven. The two danced together, combining their talents and creating a work of art where once nothing stood. The fries were also not to be scoffed at as these nifty numbers were well fried, and sported crispy golden exteriors to match their supple centers. As per usual, the holy trinity was well represented by the RSR.The aforementioned Texas toast rebounded from a poor showing on our previous visit and was perfectly toasted with just the right amount of butter. In the same vein, a perfect amount of horseradish punctuated the creamy coleslaw making it easy for us to dispose of the entire portion.  This visit was yet another resounding success at the RSR, and a great way to introduce our new coworkers to the Madison Fish Fry scene. All involved seemed more than pleased with their purchase, and commented that they this will not be their last visit to Regent Street on a Friday afternoon. Overall, we wholeheartedly endorse this Fish Fry, and are confident calling it one of the best values around town. 1206 Regent StreetMadison, WI 53715     (608) 256-7750",3291,0.24769594440647077,0.5231468823574086

The RSR. A Regent Street Mainstay. The place where nobody knows your name (and nobody cares whether they do or not). Home of The Annex. One of Madison's least favorite bars (for some reason). A little discussed, but big-time Fish Fry. Regardless, I guess I can't really criticize Madisonians too much about their indifference towards the RSR; when I was in school I rarely, if ever, visited the Retreat (and now I sorta feel like I missed out). Chalk it up as a learning experience. Since we at MFF don't want you to make the same mistakes we did, we encourage you to hit up the RSR and partake in one of Madisons hidden Fish Fry gems. At a mere $6.50 it is easily one of the best deals near campus, and should really draw bigger crowds than it does.This particular Friday, I pulled into the RSR around 11:30 to find Gabe and Miah's smiling faces there waiting for me. I told them I was meeting an ex-classmate there to discuss his new job, and if they felt so inclined, they should crash the discussion. Being the Fish Fry freaks that they are, they obliged. We waited for Aaron, and when he moseyed in a few moments later the attentive waitress returned to us and took our orders - four Fish Frys, my dear. As per usual our fish was ready about 3 minutes after she put the orders in and was fresh, fresh, fresh from the fryer. Also, as per usual, I cracked into one of my three pieces immediately and was greeted with a mouthful of steam, ahhhh... bliss. The cod was the same as it always is  three pieces of flaky fish coated in a crumbly breading with a nice salty flavor. They blended superbly with the creamy and zesty RSR tartar, which on this instance was overflowing the cup. Be still my beating heart.An adequate pile of steak fries rounded out the Fish Fry trinity, and while they were not as well fried as the fish, they were still above average. The slaw was also slightly above average with its horseradish kick and creamy substrate, although it seems like they have dialed the tanginess down a notch recently. Last, but not least, was the RSRs take on Texas toast. For some reason this element seems to be degrading over time, and I noticed that on this particular visit Miah didnt even get near it. While I have lost some of my affinity for it as well, I would still say it is at least an average accompaniment to the meal and holds its own against the run of the mill dinner roll served by most other places.After many-a Fish Fry at the RSR there a few essentials that we came to expect would be there each and every time:  1  a good Fish Fry for a great price, 2  a soda included with the meal, and 3  the polite young waitress who wasted no time in taking orders, dropping off the food, and getting refills. While it is pretty much the same as it always has been, they do seem to be evolving ever so slightly. The fish is still very good and an incredible value at $6.50. In addition, they still include a fountain soda which only increases its worth. However, recently there seems to be a revolving door wait staff, and while they all seem to get the food out on time, they are just not we have come to expect. Not bad necessarily, just different.Overall, this is still an incredibly easy Fish Fry to recommend and we will be forever confused as to why more people dont give the RSR the time of day. The place seems to have a bad reputation, and we at MFF feel it is somewhat unjustified. Sure it isnt the swankiest bar around, but then again, what is? It is still just a bar after all, and one that serves good fish at a great price to boot. That is enough for us, why not you?1206 Regent StreetMadison, WI 53715     (608) 256-7750",3707,0.16534788180310567,0.47431328207447615

Life is simply too short to not pour yourself into everything you do no matter how insignificant others may think it is. Here at Madison Fish Fry we are passionate about a lot of things, not the least of which is Fish Fry. We love sports, driving, the outdoors (on some level), and on Friday our #1 priority has to be the Fry. And why not? It is flat-out delicious and a tradition that needs our help to live on. Fish Fry IS a big part of Wisconsin, like it or not. Over on the East Side it was tradition to visit the boys down at Wilsons and indulge in their fantastic 3-piece each and every Friday during the lunch hour. When we made the move to new digs downtown this tradition was lost (and remorsefully so). While it wasnt the end of the world, it was certainly a bit of a bummer to break with the greatness we had come to know so well. Luckily for us, a little place called the Regent Street Retreat stepped up to fill that void that Wilsons left in our hearts. We showed up at the RSR last Friday and were not surprised at the lack of patronage, but were taken aback that the normal bartender/waitress was nowhere to be found. In her place stood a punky little vixen who was every bit as friendly and every bit as expedient. She came right up to our table, took our orders and brought me a beer. Seriously, three minutes later the fish was fried and our adventure began.As per usual, the RSR doesnt skimp on anything even though they only charge you $6.50. The three pieces of cod were lightly breaded and fried just right. While the pieces were smaller than they have been in the past I was actually pleased since the larger pieces of yore were just a bit too much for my lunch time appetite. These crumbly little buggers were just right and didnt make me feel bogged down afterwards. Aiding the fish was the RSR tartar which seems to be almost the exact same recipe used by our old friend Wilson. It was perfectly thick, and contained just the right proportion of relish  spot on really. Their slaw is also nice and thick and is punctuated by that horseradish blast that we have come to know and love. The RSR has definitely mastered the creamy stuff.Up until a couple weeks ago you could expect a massive pile of brew fries to accompany the meal, but for whatever reason they have recently made a swap. The new steak fries that stand in place of the brew are even better and certainly just as plentiful. These babies were perfectly fried and contain much more actual potato than their predecessors due to their thicker cut. Jer said it, and I have to agree, that these are probably the best kind of fires that go directly from the freezer to the fryer. Good choice, RSR.The last bit of Fish Fry fodder falls to the Texas toast. While my piece wasnt drowning in butter like it has been in the past it was still just kind of average. Im not sure if it is the toast, or just my tastes, but for some reason it is losing its appeal. No biggie really. It is still about average and a nice change of pace from a standard dinner toll. Overall, this RSR continues to make waves in the Madison Fish Fry scene. Yeah, it isnt the best you are gonna find, but is certainly a long way from the worst. It is simply a hell of a deal and is always served incredibly quickly by very agreeable young ladies. What more could fans of the Fry ask for? If you want good fish at a great price go to The RSR, if not there are plenty of other places out there just waiting to fleece you - just head up to the square. For my money, Ill take the RSR and run with it. If you love a good Fish Fry, youll love the RSR.1206 Regent StreetMadison, WI 53715     (608) 256-7750",3719,0.1603241972217875,0.4925794085432639

The RSR has an incredibly solid, easily recommendable Fish Fry. There simply isnt a need for me to go into elaborate detail on its contents any more.Fish  3 big pieces of light and flaky cod.

Waitresses just love the munchkins and will check on your table repeatedly, often just to get another peek at the rug rats. Since Madison Fish Fry does not have any fry of our own, we are usually subject to standard service. Well, our good friend Jer, has a niece and nephew who fall into the cute kid category, and it just so happened that he had jurisdiction over them this particular Friday. These are good Wisconsin kids who are respectful, and have been raised right. Somewhere in their upbringing they developed an (almost unnatural) affinity for the fried cheese curds. Since the RSR boasts good curds and a good Fish Fry, I suggested to Jer that we rendezvous there for some lunch action. I arrived shortly after the noon hour to find Adorable Ava and Big Bad Benny plowing through a hearty basket of the curds while Uncle Jer looked on and awaited his Fish Fry.Now, the service at the RSR is nothing to scoff at normally as the waitress/bartender basically has the place on lockdown. I have never really had to wait for anything, and when I showed up on this visit it was no different. She came to take my drink order, I told her I was having the Fish Fry and would take the Pepsi that came with it, and she was off to make it happen. Since Jer put in for his fish at the same time the kiddos' order went in, it was ready slightly before mine, which popped out of the kitchen no more than 4 minutes after she sent it in.As per usual, my $6.50 platter was set before me in pristine condition. The three generous cod fillets were mounted atop a pile of beer fires and flanked by the buttery garlic toast. The solo cups of tartar and coleslaw peaked above the mountain as if to say dont forget about me over here. I dove right in, and began to deconstruct my fried fortress.As always, the cod was superb even with the tiny bit of clean grease which accompanied it. The fish was tender and flaky with a light batter/breading that had just enough flavor. We have received the fish fresh from the fryer each visit, but I can see that if for some reason it sat before being delivered that it could get greasy and possibly soggy. Thankfully for us, our timing has been impeccable each and every time, and our fish has never been overly saturated by grease.After popping a couple of the kids curds I wasnt able to polish off my allotment of fries which was no big loss since they were a little soggier than normal. By and large they were still good, but not bordering on excellence as I have come to expect. The thick and sassy tartar was excellent however, and really took any imperfections in the fish and glossed over them which is the best compliment any tartar can receive. Unlike last week when the Texas toast was spot on, this week it was a little over buttered. Even so, it was still better than a plain Jane dinner roll which most places are 100% happy to serve. The stimulating slaw quickly helped to put any reservations about the toast to bed as the horseradish laden blend really is a force to be reckoned with. As we finished our fish the kids moseyed off to play on the pool table and enjoy a couple kiddy cocktails. How can you not like a bar where kids feel comfortable and are actually willing to wait patiently while their babysitter finishes lunch?  Overall, I will continue to highly recommend the Fish Fry at the RSR until I have a good reason not to. The fish (while a little greasy from time to time) is exceptionally flavorful, as are the fries and tartar. When you get these three items down pat you can usually just throw in any old bread and slaw and make it work, but the RSR does you one better and produces a tasty slaw and a uniquely flavorful bread option. They top it all off with a soda, and still only charge you $6.50. That sounds like a no-brainer to me.Perhaps the secret to our success is arriving early enough in the lunch hour that we are the focus of both waitress and cook  come early, leave happy is our mantra here. Whatever the case may be, MFF has found our Wilsons West, and it is the RSR. 1206 Regent StreetMadison, WI 53715     (608) 256-7750",4184,0.24041718880534677,0.5168118212197159

Most of the out-of-town students are gone, making it much easier to move around freely (save for driving down University Ave which is currently construction central). The free-wheeling summer attitude that results puts even the craggiest of individuals in a good mood, and you can almost feel the vibe as go about your day. I happen to believe a big factor in peoples moods, beyond the lack of congestion, is the Fish Fry at the Regent Street Retreat. While not technically on campus, the RSR is about as close as you are gonna get to the UW, and when grouped with the Big 10 Pub and Wandos, it constitutes the keystone in the UW Fish Fry Trinity.For us it is becoming almost routine to spend our Friday lunch hour at the RSR due mostly to the fact that their $6.50 Fish Fry is about the best value ever. I met my buddy Jer and one of his Project Assistants, Ali, outside his office, and the three of us took the short jaunt to The Retreat. Ali had no idea what she was getting into and went along with the boys in ordering the Fish Fry. When our plates were placed in front of us a few minutes later, her eyes got wide with the prospects of trying to eat that which lay before her (the RSR doesnt cheap-out just cause they only charge $6.50). Being accustomed to the mounds of fry-dom, Jer and I wasted no time in getting to work.As has been the case each and every visit, the cod was steaming hot at first bite. It was incredibly tender and flaky, almost so much so that it just fell apart. The crumbly batter clung to the flaky fish for dear life, but never once lost its grip. Jer and I put all three of them down lickitly-split, leaving Ali wondering exactly how we accomplished it, as she was not quite up to the challenge. She did do very well though. As I polished off the last of my fish all that remained were a few tiny grease spots which dotted the empty plate.The crispy coated beer fires were right on the money again, but while I really seem to enjoy this style of fries, Jer has been vocal about his indifference towards them. I think they taste great and since they are served in a more than adequate portion I give the RSR a lot of credit. I also give them props for their simply delectable tartar sauce which is thick and zesty, and compliments the fish superbly. Putting the finishing touches on the Fish Fry at the RSR are their bang-up coleslaw and the buttery Texas toast. The slaw has a serious kick of horseradish that really gives the creamy concoction a punch while the toast is slathered in butter and equally enjoyable. Well, I have said it in the past and I will say it again, we are per near becoming regulars at the RSR on Fridays. It is simply too good of a deal for MFF to pass up. Sure, the lake perch at the Big 10 may be a little better overall, but it is almost twice as expensive, especially once you tack on a soda or beer. For only $6.50 at the RSR you are getting a full-fledged Fish Fry complete with all the trimming AND a soda. It is almost too good to be true, and I have to imagine a deal this good wont last forever. Overall, I highly recommend this Fish Fry due to its completeness, value and overall deliciousness. We will be back to take advantage of this great deal again, probably next week actually1206 Regent StreetMadison, WI 53715     (608) 256-7750",3385,0.19185274560274557,0.4317342342342343

It was right down the street from my office and offered a consistently good 3-piece for lunch. Well, times change, and jobs do too. I recently began working closer to downtown and thus needed to find a new Friday staple, hopefully on par with my weekly Wilsons. When Jer suggested that the Regent Street Retreat might just be the ticket, I gave it serious consideration since both of my previous visits had been exemplarily. I determined based on these two trips that one more defining visit was in order. I called the cavalry and we agreed to meet and decide the fate of the RSR.Gabe and I arrived around 11:30, and, as per usual, the place was deserted. We grabbed a rickety table (or two) and waited for our friends. The fish of choice today was cod, but in the past has been haddock or bluegill. When I inquired into these inconsistencies, the waitress simply said: it is whatever he can get. Today he got cod apparently. Since we werent sure who all was going to show up we went ahead and ordered 3 Fish Frys, one for Gabe, Jer and I. About five minutes later a couple of my old coworkers (from the Wilsons days) sauntered in. As Nick and Jared joined us, the waitress came back to take their orders: two more Fish Frys. We briefly exchanged pleasantries and a couple minutes later our fish was ready.Just like our previous visits the Fish Fry looked pristine when served. It consisted of three nice sized pieces of cod draped over a stack of fries with cups of tartar and slaw on the side. It was capped off with two wedges of garlic toast that clung precariously to the edge of the plate. I wasted no time, grabbed a piece of fish and went deep into the sauce. The cod was extraordinarily light and really quite fluffy. The fish was tender and flaky, but almost fell apart it was so delicate. It enjoyed the same batter that normally comes on the haddock which is incredibly crumbly and light. I really enjoyed it, and Nick (a Wilsons aficionado) actually claimed it to be superior to our old standby. Jer was less enthusiastic about it, but still agreed it was tasty, just not as good as the haddock or the Wilsons cod which he recently tried. By and large everyone agreed that it was very good.Where Wilsons French fries are hit-and-miss from week to week the fries at the RSR have been very consistent. They have a nice crispy coating and have been freshly fried each and every time. The portion size is also generous, which is more than you can say for the Atwood institution. The RSR tartar is very good and the thick, creamy sauce, boasts a near perfect proportion of mayo to relish which rivals even the best tartar around.The RSR slaw is also vastly superior to its predecessor at Wilsons and enjoys a tangy kick of horseradish that, at the least, makes it unique. The garlic bread is also unique, although today it was so drenched in butter that it got a little soggy. Oh well, it was still better than a plain-Jane dinner roll.Overall, this is an easy Fish Fry to recommend. Be it: cod, haddock, or bluegill, the RSR knows how to fry em. My only qualm about making this the de-facto Friday option is the inconsistency in fish type offered. I really dont want to have to call ahead every time to figure out what is on special, although if all the fish is good, maybe it doesnt matter? I do really like to know what fish I will be eating ahead of time though Regardless, the service has been solid each and every time and the food is really good. When you consider that you get a full Fish Fry with all the trimming and a soda for only $6.50 it is hard to think of a good reason not to make this the new standard. This baby is certainly a diamond in the rough (as Nick put it) and easily the best deal downtown. Is it our definitive Friday lunch spot at this point? Not yet, but it is getting closer.1206 Regent StreetMadison, WI 53715     (608) 256-7750",3982,0.22958138902944092,0.47421412642191846

Are you ready for it? OK, here it is, but you gotta promise not to go blabbing it all over town The Regent Street Retreat is quietly offering one of the best Fish Frys in Madison and no one seems to have picked up on it I am only telling you because we are friends, but seriously, keep it on the down low. The first time we stepped foot in the RSR a couple months back we were not at all surprised to see the place was practically empty during lunch on Friday. Like most, we figured that the food was probably just not that good since the bar has a reputation as being kind of skuzzy. After receiving great service and a delicious Fish Fry we quickly changed our tune, and started singing the praises of the (surprisingly clean) downtown establishment. I knew it was only a matter of time before we would return, but I was still surprised when Gabe, Jer and I entered and the bar was even more deserted bar than on our first visit.We grabbed the same table that we took on our first trip and the same bartender/waitress came over immediately. She grabbed us all a beer and when she came back with them grabbed our orders: 3 Fish Frys, my dear. Much like our previous visit, the cook/presumed owner was in the kitchen chomping at the bit to make some grub. He had our fish fried and ready in no time. It was placed before us in pristine condition.I previously perused the bluegill, but this time haddock was the lone fish choice. My three large pieces were piping hot when served and simply scrumptious when tasted. The haddock was incredibly light and flaky with a delicious batter to match. The fish basically fell apart without effort which made it hard to eat with your fingers, but no less sumptuous. Although a tiny pool of grease leached from them and coated some of my fries it was still very good as were the grease soaked potatoes. My three asymmetric pieces of fish were gone in no time, and even though they all looked different they all tasted equally good.Accompanying the haddock were some kind of beer fries which I really enjoyed. Jer was less enthusiastic about them, but I think the crispy coated tuber segments were a near perfect addition to the fall-apart flaky fish. The mayo-rich tartar was also great by my standards, and improved the overall taste sensation without stealing the show from the fish. Mmm mmm mmm. A zesty, sysco-esque slaw was added to the mix and while it may not have been homemade, it was no less tasty. It had a distinct flavor, and like the garlic toast, added some additional flair to the meal. The RSR is truly the first real Fish Fry paradox I have come across. It is a great Fish Fry; it is cheap as hell, and served to you by a friendly young lady, in no time flat. What more are people looking for? It seemed to us that the presumed owner-guy was wondering the same thing what the hell do I need to do to get people to try my Fish Fry? To him I say, give it time good sir. If you build it, they will comeOverall, I recommend this Fish Fry highly because it is simply a fantastic deal. Basically, you get full-fledged meal, complete with three full pieces of fish and some bread for only $6.50! There is no cheaping-out here, my friends. I really cant tell you what is going on that makes this Fish Fry so unpopular, but I am fine with it. While I do recommend you try the Fish Fry at the RSR, I am 100% fine if you dont because it just means quicker service for me.  1206 Regent StreetMadison, WI 53715     (608) 256-7750",3592,0.25205565998329166,0.5030649540517962

Gabe and Jeff both went for the haddock with a soda while I went for the bluegill and a beer. The waitress rushed the order to the kitchen and grabbed our drinks. No sooner did I get through my first drink of Spotted Cow than the steaming hot plate of food was on us. I swear to god it was ready in less than 3 minutes flat; it was nuts, by far the fastest I have ever seen Fish Fry served. The underdog put one on the board early.As quickly as it hit the table, my hands were on it. I snagged up one of the 12 or so tiny bluegill fillets and went to work. The fish was simply great. It completely lacked the “fishy” taste I usually associate with freshwater fish and the elasticity common with bluegill. The fish was tender, delicate and fall apart flaky. The batter was also delicious. While it wasn’t razor thin, it was light and flaky, and didn’t overpower the fish underneath. A couple of the fillets were oddly sized, but when you get so much it is okay to have an odd one here and there, and even these oddballs were tasty. I quickly polished off my entire lot while they hot were still steaming, but did notice that some grease was starting to accumulate near the end.The haddock was also very good. The three fillets were quite generous especially when you consider the price. The haddock appeared to have a similar (if not exactly the same batter) as the bluegill. It was also light and flaky and tasted very good but not quite as good as its freshwater counterpart, in my opinion. However, both fish styles were enhanced by the thick, mayo-y tartar. This concoction was certainly above average and the small cup turned out to be enough for the hearty portion of bluegill, although I think the haddock would have pushed it beyond its limits. The French fries were of the Julienne variety. They were thick cut and well fried with a perfectly crispy outside, and a mushy inside. They were not phenomenal, but pretty damn good all things considered. After getting a good cross section of the items sampled it became clear that the RSR was never really an underdog, and is a Fish Fry to be reckoned with. To top off the meal they give you a cup of finely chopped coleslaw and some buttery Texas toast. The slaw was zesty and creamy, but could not hold a candle to the warm, grilled Texas toast. The fish, fries and tartar were already well worth the price tag, but when you tack on this toast and slaw it becomes a serious bargain. What's more, the addition of a fountain soda to the mix leaves you with possibly the best value in town. All told, you get a complete Fish Fry for $6.50 which seems to be barely enough for them to cut a profit (at least in our opinion).

The fish was good, borderline recommendable  but good nonetheless. Take that, Yelp!As I anticipated (based on their lackluster online reviews) the Tied House wasnt very busy this Friday. The place wasnt empty or anything like that, but for such a nice-looking, inoffensive restaurant I would really expect a lot more people on a Wisconsin Friday. We got a table lickety-split, and sat down to look over the options. It took surprisingly long for our waiter to come by which really gave me time to deliberate between the $12 4-piece cod or the $13 walleye. When he finally showed up about five minutes later our orders went in, after he made a quick beer run that is.After that initial delay everything went smoothly and I had my cod 10 minutes after ordering it. It was served scalding hot by a different server-person which actually seemed to irritate Rich (out waiter) somewhat  it was kind of amusing. I wasted no time and had at the fish the second his back was turned. The pieces were stacked Lincoln-log style and had a light, spicy breading which was reminiscent of our beloved Wilsons. The first bites were actually quite delicious, but as time passed the breading degraded due to a little accumulated grease. The cod itself was flaky and light, but the grease it produced caused the wimpy breading to flake off making the fork a necessity rather than an option.The Tied House has a vast amount of sides to choose from and I settled on the cheesy hash browns. The finely grated spuds were smooth and creamy, very much like those at Buck & Honeys. They were delicious and we cant really complain at all. We also have no qualms with the tartar as the mayo-heavy mix was dynamite. It housed just the right amount of relish and what appeared to be a few pimientos for color. Finishing off the Fry was Grays slaw which was creamy and rich with a adequate amount of zip. It was a diverse blend and the red cabbage contingent jumped to the head of the class. Oddly, there was no bread served which is a bit of a buzz kill, but it is what it is. No rye for you! All in all, I was actually pretty surprised by our visit to the Tied House. Most of the reviewers say it is average and unoriginal but compared to somewhere like Applebees or TGIFridays it is much more wholesome feeling, and the food doesnt have that vibe where everything seems to be reconstituted from a bag of powder. Overall, we feel pretty good about recommending the fish we had, and will be back some day to verify that The Tied House was indeed better than others have made it out to be. www.graystiedhouse.com/950 Kimball LaneVerona, WI 53593     (608) 845-2337",2841,0.21716370729082593,0.5053605057842346

I assumed some of the mystique of it being “the new place” would have worn off by now but they must have seamlessly transitioned into just being “the place” because it was packed. We arrived after 8pm and were told we would have about a 30 minute wait, it actually wound up being more like an hour and only after we got seated was the place truly starting to clear out.The restaurant is a really nice place. Since it is still newish everything has a kind of modern feel which I assume is pretty unique in The Grove. Since we had a decent wait we had plenty of time to chill in the bar, enjoy the ambiance and watch Blake Griffin tear Syracuse a new one. We also noticed that the group next to us seemed to be wearing an awful lot of UW paraphernalia and be very popular with various patrons entering and exiting the establishment. I was trying my best to put two and two together and figure out what sporting event they were at. I knew the men’s hockey team wasn’t around and the basketball team was long gone. Eventually I overheard an older gent come up say “Hello Mr. Vetter…” It was then I realized that it was UW Women’s Hockey goaltender Jessie Vetter’s parents proudly boasting their UW and USA hockey garb, celebrating the national championship  and whatnot…true local celebrities.Eventually our vibrating coaster thing went off, scared the crap out of me, and we got a table. The Fish Fry at 1855 was 3 good sized pieces of beer battered Cod served with “smashed” baby red potatoes, tartar, slaw and bread. The Cod was served hot and tasted good although it was little heavy. The batter was actually a fairly thin coating and had a decent taste but was very firm. My slightly greasy fish actually slipped completely out of its “shell” more than once. The potatoes were all right but I would much rather have had French fries. The tartar sauce as good, although a very conservative portion had me asking for a second helping.The bread came before the fish and the warm slices did a nice job bridging the gap. The coleslaw was also pretty good and had a discernable aftertaste that actually made you want to eat more, very peculiar. The service was also good but I barely remember it for some reason. Overall this was a decent Fish Fry but not really great. The food is obviously very high quality it seems like they are just trying to push it a little too far by making the batter too unique, the potatoes, too original, et cetera. However, you can almost recommend this Fish Fry based on quality alone, I’m sure there are folks out there that would really like this Fish Fry, it is just a bit much for me. www.1855saloongrill.com/218 S.

Joey's AYCE haddock was as rock solid as they come and never disappointed from a quality or cost perspective. North and South retains some of that, but unfortunately, not all of it.N&S still has AYCE haddock on Fridays (as well as some other non-AYCE options), but it's now $14 instead of $13. Inflation is to be expected, so that's not that big of a deal; what was more worrisome was the fish. Whereas the fish at Joey's always tasted like fish, the haddock at North and South had a decidedly shrimp-y flavor. The two marine members clearly shared the same fryer with the flavor of the shrimp permeating the fish's batter. Besides that unwelcome essence, the batter was light and crispy, but the only flavor you could really discern was the shrimp. It was hard to look past it, and it wasn't an isolated occurrence as both rounds had the same issue. Like Joey's, N&S has a plethora of sides to choose from and since I'd had plenty of fries and slaw recently I went off the board with potato cakes and mac-n-cheese. I presumed the cakes would be pancakes, but they were more loaf-y than that. Rather than thin, they were bloated, and more like a deep fried cheesy potato puff with onion. In actuality, they were really good, a welcomed change up from regular old fries, and lacked any sort of shrimp flavor (which was a plus). The mac-n-cheese was also super creamy and really flavorful, basically exactly what you'd expect from a smoke house. There are also baked beans, fries, slaw and many other sides to choose from so any diner should walk away happy here. A hallmark of Joey's was their mini cornbread muffins that came with literally e v e r y t h i n g. N&S has phased out the gritty delights in favor of well...nothing. It's a total bummer as they were always a treat and will definitely be missed. A superb tartar may have save the shrimp, whoops...I mean fish, but this blend fell flat. While it was pungent, it wasn't pungent in the normal supper club kinda way. It was a bit stanky and only made the fish marginally better. While it wasn't coarse, it wasn't smooth either and just didn't do it for me. The old mantra states: do one thing and do it well. While I wouldn't say N&S has stretched themselves too thin, I can say their AYCE haddock missed the mark this time. Overall, we don't recommend this Fish Fry, but won't totally write them off. Places can bounce back, and maybe next time we'll get there before too many orders of shrimp hit the fryer.  eatnorthandsouth.com/6602 Mineral Point RoadMadison, WI 53705     (608) 829-0093",2754,0.10939542483660131,0.4589429361488185

These places tend to have figured out all the subtle nuances that transform the meal from plain old fried fish into a full-fledged Fish Fry. Things like relish trays, homemade coleslaw, and hand-muddled Old Fashioneds are a few of the little add-ons that take everything to the next level and set the supper club or local tavern apart. Joeys Seafood on Mineral Point Road is not one of these places.Thats not to say Joeys doesnt have a great little Fish Fry though. Joeys is a franchise turned family operation that offers nice, clean food, in a family friendly environment. Whats more, Joeys will actually take a reservation on Friday nights - although they refer to it as preferred seating rather than a definitive time where a table is guaranteed. Since we were meeting friends and have a little one we made a date for 7:00, and were happy enough to be seated by 7:15ish. Joeys has fish all day every day, but on Friday they offer a true All You Can Eat haddock Fish Fry that is sure to please. Before the fish finds its way to the table a basket of mini-cornbread muffins will show itself. They are Joeys standard bread option that comes with every meal and represent cornbread well. Our waitress was on her game and she had our fish in front of us in no time flat. The first round was hot although not scalding by any means. This minor transgression would be remedied on round 2. Regardless of its temperature the haddock was quite tasty. The smooth fish was paired with a relatively light batter, but the pieces were on the small side. The original portion would certainly not have been sufficient so its a good thing it was AYCE. One or two also had a slight shrimp-y flavor which let you know that fryer oil had been shared.The fries followed suit and were good, but nothing special. They were the standard julienne cuts and a came in a decent numbers although I certainly would have liked a second helping on round 2. Truth be told, I regretted not trying potato cakes which sounded like a very unique offering. Im still kicking myself. Continuing the trend of inoffensiveness was Joeys tartar which was pretty much straight mayo, although I think I caught one good sized pickle chunk in there. The slaw was also a fine blend and clearly made in-house, but had a so-so flavor and not much zip. While Joeys isnt the prototypical Fish Fry joint they do an admirable job with their Friday special. The fish is good, and since its AYCE there is plenty to go around. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and think its a one of the best you will find on Madisons west side even if its not a supper club or classic tavern. eatnorthandsouth.com/6602 Mineral Point RoadMadison, WI 53705     (608) 829-0093",2852,0.20284933645589381,0.45612151964611003

Eight bucks for two of the tiniest, greasiest pieces of fish we have ever seen? Say it aint so! A tasty, but tiny portion of fries? Oh, Joe. Say it just isnt so! Creamy tartar, without a hint of relish? Please, please, Joe,  say that this just aint so! When we showed up at Joeys we thought that we simply couldnt lose. Wed partied with Joe, and his AYCE haddock a few times previously, and been more than pleased with the results. From the flawless fish to the complimentary corn bread, everything hit the mark. Today we deviated from the game plan, and went for the $8 2-piece instead of the $12 AYCE which turned out to be a huge misstep on our part. When I first gazed upon the fish I knew we were in trouble. The two measly pieces of haddock were long, thin, and greasy. Despite those detractors it actually tasted good, but the portion was simply way, way too small to be anywhere near satisfying. Had the portion been more substantial (AYCE for example) I would likely recommend it, but eight bucks for this skimpy bit of fish was just not a good deal.Thick on cut, but thin on quantity, the Julienne fries were delicious, but failed to satisfy. Likewise, the tartar didnt please the crowd with its lack of relish and hint of horseradish. The complimentary corn muffins, while they didnt scream Fish Fry, were better than nothing, and did fulfill the need. The only thing in abundance was the homemade-looking slaw, which was good, but in no way picked up all the slack left by the fish and fries. Overall, we just cant recommend this Fish Fry. I guess for some reason I assumed that if you were only getting the 2-piece they would give you two bigger pieces  makes sense, doesnt it? It turns out they just give you the same ones you would get with the AYCE, which are small, but can easily be made up for with the All You Can Eat option. There was simply nothing to make up for it with the 2-piece, and when we go back it will be AYCE or nothing. In the end, the $4 AYCE upgrade is well worth it. eatnorthandsouth.com/6602 Mineral Point RoadMadison, WI 53705     (608) 829-0093",2118,0.10365853658536585,0.5145470383275262

A more recent version on Wikipedia is a little more thorough as their definition reflects some actual thought on the subject: a meal usually consisting of either battered or breaded fried fish, French fries, coleslaw, hushpuppies,  lemon slices, sauce, malt vinegar and dessert. While I wouldnt say either definition is dead on, the Wikipedia version at least hints at that which should be expected at a Fish Fry. The Wiki explanation is broad enough to cover pretty much all the bases including supplementary items like lemon wedges and malt vinegar. They do mention the staples of the Fry, namely the fried fish, potato (French fries), tartar sauce, and coleslaw, but for some reason they omit bread. They instead include hush puppies and dessert, which while nice, are both rare to see at a Fish Fry. Tobys Supper Club and the Churches are the only places we have ever been that include dessert, so it is tough to make that part of the definition. Some places do still offer hush puppies, but not many; Joeys Seafood on Mineral Point Road is one of the few. On Friday Joeys serves AYCE haddock which is probably more definitive than most.Fish: The haddock at Joeys is nothing less than exemplarily. The fish is served in long, thin fillets that practically float on air. The fish appears to be high quality and well trimmed resulting in perfectly smooth white fish. The batter is incredibly light and flaky and tastes great. The combination of the light fish and light batter makes putting five pieces or more away no problem (even during lunch, which actually might be a problem).  French fries:   The French fries are of the skin-on Julienne cut variety. They are well fried and play their part admirably. I have no complaints. Tartar:  Being that Joeys is in the seafood game exclusively youd figure they would have a good handle on the tartar. That being said, their sauce is good and does aide the fish, but is not ideal. It is basically straight up mayo with a tiny hint of horseradish. While it tastes good, it is certainly not typical tartar and could not be used to define what tartar should be. Bread:  Although the Wiki nerds dont seem to think bread is a component in a good Fish Fry, we know better. Joeys doesnt include it in their menu descriptions either, but like most places, it is standard fare regardless of what you get. Dont let the standard term fool you though; Joeys bread option is a basket of tiny cornbread muffins served with honey butter that is nothing less that delicious. Jer wrecked the basket I had one. Misc:   We normally only care about quick service and decent coleslaw, but since Joeys is a seafood place they have things like malt vinegar and Old Bay Seasoning which also add to the diversity. Whats more, in fitting with the Wiki definition they do offer hush puppies as a side in addition to several other things like red beans and rice. I actually tried the hush puppies instead of slaw and was not impressed. They were really dry, likely straight from Sysco, and overly loaded with onion. Jer was also not thrilled with his red beans and rice, but did like the slaw.Fish Fry is hard to define as it means a little something different to everyone. Some people think back to eating at their local VFW with grandma and grandpa and what they got there is exactly what they expect every time. Others are used to places like St. Peters where it is dirt cheap and they just keep pumping food in your direction until you cry uncle. Still others expect fancy fish with unique interpretations like you find at Picassos or Coopers Tavern. Regardless of what you expect, Joeys will not disappoint. Overall, the AYCE haddock is easily recommendable and while it is not the definitive Fish Fry, it meets all our criteria for greatness. In addition, you can get it any day of the week which probably makes this the best every day Fish Fry in the city. Of course, it is one of, if not, the only every day Fish Frys in the city, but you get the point.eatnorthandsouth.com/6602 Mineral Point RoadMadison, WI 53705     (608) 829-0093",4333,0.11458656330749352,0.464467054263566

The fish had a light and flaky texture to match the batter and was very good, although I will lean towards the haddock on subsequent visits. I also got a piece of the lake perch which had a little more flavor than the cod but the same batter. Usually perch is adorned with a different style of batter (more like a breading), but I must say this stuff worked really well across the board and was probably a little better on the perch than the cod even though I didnt expect it to be. As per usual the French fries were salty and well fried. They were simply a great compliment to the fish without being overbearing. The tartar was also great and made the fish all the more delectable. It is served in the classic supper club style tin cup and has a classic supper club taste to match.

Joeys used to be a chain restaurant, albeit a small one and I have found chains tend not to offer the best in Fish Fry. Apparently the Joeys franchise went under, but due to its popularity the Madison location stayed open under local ownership. After seeing a few favorable comments on the state of affairs at Joeys I decided to move them up my list.Joeys offers fried fish every day, and quite a variety at that. Basically every fish option (besides bluegill) is in play from haddock and cod, to lake perch and walleye; they are all there along with plenty of their other deep sea neighbors like crab and mussels. Usually Joeys refers to their fried fish as Fish and Chips but on Fridays they crank it up another notch and offer an All You Can Eat Haddock Fish Fry for 11 bucks. Although they do still cut you a deal on the regular haddock Fish and Chips if the AYCE is too daunting of a task. Between the two of us Jer and I got one AYCE Haddock for $11 and one haddock Fish and Chips for $7.The food came about 15 minutes or so after we ordered, fresh from the fryer and hot as can be. The haddock was served in long thin strips and was covered in a light flaky batter. The fish itself tasted great and was so light and delicate that it practically floated on air. I devoured my original three pieces and re-upped with a couple more and another plate of fries.Like the fish, the French fries were perfectly fried and tasty. They enjoyed some sort of seasoning salt which really gave the skin-on potatoes a delightful kick. The tartar also had a nice little kick to it. It was a thick, mayo-heavy blend that helped to put the fish over the top, although as Jer noted, the haddock was so good it wasnt really even necessary. With your fish you also get a really tasty coleslaw and some mini cornbreads. The cornbread was delicious and is clearly one of their staples as comes whether you get fish or not. While it is not really traditional Fish Fry bread it was still very good.  While Joeys may have been a chain at one time it is certainly no Long John Silvers. The fish, fries and tartar were outstanding. When you consider the quality and quantity of food the 11 dollar price tag is more than reasonable. To top it all off the service was great even though the place was bustling with the elderly of Madisons Westside. Overall, I can easily recommend the haddock Fish Fry at Joeys and will be back soon to try their other tempting fish options.eatnorthandsouth.com/6602 Mineral Point RoadMadison, WI 53705     (608) 829-0093",2709,0.2336166666666667,0.5109717948717948
http://madisonfishfry.com/reviews.php?restaurant=162,http://madisonfishfry.com/reviews.php?restaurant=162&event=518,2010-08-13,Outpost Bar & Grill,"Overall, I would barely recommend this Fish Fry.",Good,Good,Good,Poor,Good,"If there is one thing you should know about Madison Fish Fry it is that if you make a claim about great Fish Fry at place X we will show up there before too long. We recently heard rumors that The Outpost Bar and Grill in Cottage Grove was an X and supposedly this X marked the spot of the Groves best Fish Fry. Wasting no time, I rounded up a small crew and headed to the busiest part of town on any given Friday. Now, this particular area of Cottage Grove is a hectic little spot on Fridays, but it really cant be attributed to The Outpost, although they do draw their fair share of folks. The main culprit is the  1855 Saloon which resides directly across the street from the tiny neighborhood bar. For some reason the 1855 is the place to be on Friday, even though their Fish Fry leaves a little something to be desired (in our opinion). Regardless, the popularity of the Saloon leads to cramped streets and little in the way of parking. Luckily for team Fish Fry, we found an open stall smack-dab in front of The Outpost; things couldnt have started off on a better note. The plan was for the Fry Guy to grab his fish at the bar while the ladies hopped across to the 1855 for some fancier foods. Well, upon hearing that the Saloon offered little more than an hour and a half wait, the whole crew decided to drop anchor at The Post and see what was what. We waited at the bar for a good 20 minutes, had a beer, and noticed the Best of Cottage Grove  Fish Fry signs that dotted the walls. We were intrigued by the positive praise and ready to see what the hubbub was all about. We only had a few adults and one kid in our party, but for some reason got the biggest booth/table in the place. The waitress came over pretty soon after we were seated and took our orders  two Fish Frys (one large and one small) and one salad bar for our resident herbivore. As soon as she departed we scampered to the salad bar to see what there was to see. It was filled with supper club staples which is impressive considering this aint no supper club. We loaded up on salad, cottage cheese and slaw and headed back to our booth/table hybrid.The salads didnt last long, and actually didnt have to. Before MFF had consumed his fill, the fish hit the table and the greens were quickly cast aside in favor of heartier endeavors. And by hearty, I mean hearty. The large Fish Fry at The Post will run you ten bucks and is definitely not skimpy. Usually if I hear about a 4-piece for that price, including salad bar, I assume the pieces are gonna be teeny tiny -these were not. These were full sized cod fillets and were pretty good, but not as great as I was hoping they would be at first glance. They sported a light breading which had a little spice but certainly could have used a bit more. The fish itself was fairly flaky, but wasnt really moist. Since these were full fillets with both thick and thin sections, the lack of moisture led to thin stuff getting a little firm and chewy. Overall, it was decent and the flaky fish far outweighed the less desirable parts.Making even the not so flaky parts of the fish more edible was the zesty tartar. The well-proportioned mayo blend was on the level and they made sure to add a second cup with the large fish portion. Extra sauce is always a good choice for a cook to make with this much fish. Usually Madison Fish Fry is a French fry eating machine, but whenever we see potato pancakes as an option, we just cant help ourselves. Unfortunately, The Outposts rendition of the Fish Fry classic is not exactly what we were hoping for. These cakes didnt appear to be made in house and while they did have a hint of onion, were nothing to crow about even with the scoop of apple sauce that tagged along. The only bread served with the Fish Fry was apparently located on the salad bar, and must have run out because the basket was empty when we went through the line and never seemed to get refilled. Oh well, their loss.This Fish Fry was a bit of a mixed bag. The cod was decent and served in a huge portion, while the potato pancakes should have been a step up from regular fries, but were actually just so-so. The tartar was fine and the salad bar was a nice addition, but it all just barely adds up. Basically, this might amount to the best Fish Fry in the area, but that is only because the only other places around are the Black Bear Inn and 1855, which are subpar at best. Cottage Grove just doesnt seem to be representing on the Fish Fry front which is a bit of a shame. Sure Doubledays and the Oakleaf are up the road, but I would expect more than a couple/three decent Fish Frys in a town of this size. Overall, I still think the Fish Fry at The Outpost is recommendable, but juuuuuust barely.227 S. Main StreetCottage Grove, WI 53527     (608) 839-5205",4814,0.15507056718791407,0.4873618869792339

A while back, almost two years to be exact, we stumbled upon the all you can eat Fish Fry at the Immaculate Heart of Mary School. While we enjoyed the hospitality and the atmosphere, we were not exactly blown away by the actual Fish Fry. As the old saying goes, the lord works in mysterious ways. While visiting the St. Peter Catholic School Fish Fry in Ashton a couple weeks ago we shared a table with some folks who claimed the IHMS Fry was superior due to the fact they have beer battered as well as regular fried cod, whereas St. Peter only has one style. Since I believe the Fish Fry at St. Peter to be some of the absolute best around, I took this claim very seriously and knew we had to revisit the IHMS ASAP.Let the sermon commenceWe arrived at the school just before 6:30, and got in the short line to pay. The Fabulous Fish Fry will run you exactly $10, with no tipping necessary later on. We gladly offered up the dough and followed the scent of fried fish down the hall towards the gym. As we approached the end of the line, Jer sauntered right past Gabe and I on his way to the front. He was on a quest to see what could be had in the way of refreshments. When he came back with a round of ice-cold Spotted Cows and told us of the scant two-fifty price tag, I knew divine intervention was at hand. The lord was smiling upon us this night. For all those allergic to seafood, please hear our prayer.After about 10 minutes of waiting in the hall, a table opened up for us and the service began. We claimed our turf at Table 27, and headed towards the buffet line. Now, I normally dont like buffet style Fish Fry because the fish tends not to be fresh from the fryer, and the longer it sits the worse it gets. However the turnover at IHMS is so high that nary a piece of fish has a chance to get cold. The buffet consists of (in order): bread, salad, coleslaw, applesauce, French fries, baked potato, baked/beer batter/regular fried cod, tartar sauce, milk and coffee, of which I took everything except a baked potato, the baked cod and coffee. I performed a delicate balancing act; my one hand consisting of a plate, piled high with a mountain of fried delights, the other clenching a trio of milk cartons (one chocolate). I scurried back to the table as best I could, and began my feast.For all those who can no longer eat fried food, please hear our prayer.At the onset I grabbed one of my two pieces of beer battered. I was immediately struck by how light the batter was. It was flaky and had a good taste as did the actual fish underneath. The regular fried was also very good and enjoyed a light breading which had a little spice to it. While neither can hold a candle to the St. Peter Cod in my opinion, both were better than I remembered them being the last time. I actually enjoyed the beer batter a little more than the plain fried this time which is the exact opposite of what I experienced previously.For all those vegetarians who have chosen to not enjoy your bounty, please hear our prayer.The fries were also significantly better this visit. In 2008 they were basically a thick Julienne cut and were very bland. The crinkle cut fries they had this time were much more on par with what you come to expect at an AYCE, and I had no problem putting away a couple serving worth. In addition the tartar was vastly improved and served in individual cups which were still chilled.For all those non-Wisconsinites that dont know what theyre missing out on, please hear our prayer.I bowed my head in gratitude. The fish, fries and tartar were all drastically improved over our previous trip and I got to drink my favorite beer as we waited. The average white roll didnt do a whole lot, but then again it didnt have to; at the least, it was fresh and soft. The salad, coleslaw and applesauce were also just fine, but none of them were transcendent. For all those who go out for a steak on a Friday night instead of Fish Fry, please hear our prayer.Im not sure exactly what the deal was on our last visit, but when we wanted more fish we had to go through the buffet line again. This trip we had a waiter - of sorts. Ashton (oddly enough), was our ~10 year old server who was nothing short of amazing. When we ran low on something, Ashton was there. He got our table more refills than we could ask for. Before we knew we needed it, Ashton was ready to get it. He had no problem ducking and weaving through the crowd as he ran to the buffet to do our bidding. He was often back with your food before you knew he had even left to get it. This child was doing the lords work and loving it. Beyond the food, his excellent attitude helped to make this Fish Fry a top notch experience. He even got me a scoop of ice cream at the end although I was more than willing to go myself. Jesus loves you, young man.For all those who love Fish Fry and can barely wait for next Friday to get here, please hear our prayer.  Overall, I would recommend this Fish Fry based on the food alone, but having an eager youngster racing around on our behalf made it truly memorable. While it is no St. Petes, it is certainly no slouch, and like St. Petes it is an all around fantastic value. All told, I ate much too much at this Fish Fry; as I waddled away from the school I had the smell of Fish Fry all over me. I had been baptized in the IHOM Fry, we all had. It had saturated not only our clothes, but our souls. Praise be!Thus ends todays sermon, this is the word of the Fish Fry.

Served in the auditorium of the school the room was abuzz with youngsters clearing plates and hawking ‘delicious’ baked goods on the more than willing patrons. Not truly family style, it was more of a buffet, but still all you can eat. My friends and I all left more than satisfied.The cod was available three different ways: baked, fried and beer battered. I started with two each of the plain fried and the beer battered. Both were good, but after eating 4 good sized pieces I only needed one more, and my choice fell to the plain fried which was slightly better. The French fries were more than likely the same ones that are served for school lunches but were okay, not great. The tartar sauce was plentiful but was warm due to the fact it was in a huge bottle at the table, it was still decent. The bread was a little roll which was good, and ‘good for me’ according to the eager 10 year old who served them up. There were a few options beyond coleslaw, such as applesauce and salad, which is nice. In addition you get all the 1% or skim milk you can drink, AND a couple scoops of delicious Schoepps ice cream to top it off. Overall this was a fun Fish Fry and well worth the $9.75. I would recommend both the beer battered and fried cod, but would lean towards the plain fried if I were to go back again.

Gabe and I took the 20 minute drive north of DeForest only to find the Wild West themed restaurant closed for “vacations & remodeling”. Since we were already in that neck of the woods I figured we might as well hit up the Lockwoods Longshot in Arlington.We showed up and grabbed a drink and were told to put our names on the list. Apparently one waitress was out sick so there was only one bartender and one waitress handling the whole place and it was keeping them plenty busy. We wound up waiting for a good 20 minutes even though there were a lot of available seats in the dining area. Eventually we got seated and waited for our waitress for another 5 minutes. She was somewhat crabby and justifiably so but, it was still kind of unappetizing. Regardless I remembered the fish being very good so I opted for the four piece because I was hungry. Before the fish we got to choose from salad or beans & slaw. I picked the beans & slaw which were both very good. I finished both and waited the 15 minutes for the fish to show up. Our four pieces Fish Fries came and wound up being way too much to eat. The fish was nice and hot and had a very tasty batter but was not quite as light and flaky as I remembered. My pieces got greasy on the bottom very quickly and I had to flip them over to keep them lively. The tartar seemed better this time as the mayo and relish seemed to be in better proportion which was nice. The straight cut fries were good, just about what I remember. What I can’t really recall what the bread was like but clearly it was not memorable enough. While the waitress was kind of rushed she did do a good job with our table so I really can’t complain about her beyond the fact we could hear her grumbling on her way in and out of the kitchen. Overall, this visit to the Longshot was a bit of a let down. However, when the Longshot is fully staffed and on their game it is definitely recommendable so I will give them some slack. The main elements of the Fish Fry are good and the beans and slaw option is nice. I still feel like I can recommend this Fish Fry but I’m not sure if we will be back to Lockwoods…it is a long shot at this point. 210 US Hwy 51Arlington, WI 53911     (608) 635-7790",2350,0.20992096287550827,0.5513997113997113

He had been there a couple times and been very pleased so I decided to give it a shot. We arrived fairly early and were seated pretty much immediately. The Fish Fry special was clearly posted on the wall above the bar and in the dining room. 2 piece Fish Fry - $7.95, 3 piece - $8.95, 4 piece $9.95 with a salad or beans & coleslaw, and a baked potato or French fries.  We opted for the 3 piece which was just about perfect, although I bet I could have put that fourth piece away if I would have needed to. The fish was delicious, light and flaky and hot as it gets. The batter was light and very tasty. The French fries were also spectacular. Skin on potatoes cooked just right. The coleslaw and beans were actually pretty good too, although the beans could have been a little warmer. A pumpernickel-rye kind of bread was served and looked like it had come strait out of the package from the store. I also thought the tartar was a little strange. While I like a thick mayo-relish tartar sauce, this stuff was practically straight mayo and was a little over the top.The Longshot is essentially a bar with a small dining area off one to one side. This certainly is not the fanciest place you are gonna find for dinner but they do know how to fry a piece of cod. The service was lackluster which was slightly disappointing but I think the food made up the difference. If you are looking to get out of town some Friday night and are in the mood for a low-key Fish Fry take the 20 minute drive to Arlington and hit up Lockwoods Longshot. Good fish for a good price.210 US Hwy 51Arlington, WI 53911     (608) 635-7790",1682,0.2143398268398269,0.5374819624819627

We went to an alternative style Fish Fry and it just didnt work out. I knew I needed a real classic style Fish Fry this Friday and that is exactly what we got at Doubledays in Cottage Grove.I had been reluctant to try Doubledays based on the fact that it shares a building with a bowling alley. Usually (and I dont think I am off base saying this) bowling alleys are not the best places for a nice dinner, that is unless of course you listen to our friend Terry of Fubar fame. This may have been an unfair appraisal of the situation as we would soon find out. The actual restaurant and banquet hall that is Doubledays is upstairs and completely separate from the bowling alley below, in fact I am positive that I did not once here the explosion of bowling pins during my meal. On Friday nights Doubledays does a massive Fish Fry that seems to be their big event for the week and let me tell you this was an event.Doubledays is not messing around and they throw out the full gamut of fish options on Friday Nights. They have Cod, Walleye, Lake Perch, Bluegill as well as some non-fish options. You can check their website in the link below for prices but everything was more than reasonable. Since I knew Gabe would go for the Cod my choice was narrowed down to freshwater fish, and I opted for the Bluegill. A trip to the salad bar is included with the all the fish except for the cod. If you get cod it can be added for a dollar more and is definitely worth the upgrade over a coleslaw/cottage cheese option. I got the clam chowder which was decent but certainly not great. It tasted very clammy, but Im not sure if I ever once actually bit into any clam, hmmm? Still, with a Fish Fry I dont even expect to get a soup and salad bar so it was very nice upgrade over the standard. We enjoyed our salads and within 5 minutes or so our dinners were ready.The plates came from the kitchen as hot as can be. My fish and fries were scalding. They claim to serve a half pound of Bluegill with each order and I can verify that its true. My plate was covered with 12-14 mid to large sized Bluegill filets which were well cooked and had a very flavorful, but not overbearing batter. They were delicious. The cod seemed to enjoy the same batter which clearly had some sort of spices in it that made it tasty and unique. Overall, I would say the Bluegill was better Bluegill than the Cod was Cod. Gabe is a bit of a Cod aficionado and thought the opposite. Regardless, they were both very good, and can easily be recommended.The French fries were also on the money. They were shoestring style, served hot and crispy and absolutely delicious. The tartar sauce was also dead on and did everything to enhance my fish without drawing too much unnecessary attention. The bread was a standard style dinner roll and was available on the salad bar, it was also above average.The atmosphere at Doubledays is kind of odd since it is basically one large room with a bar at one end that can be divided in half with a big curtain. If you grew up in Wisconsin you have seen this sort of thing before so it isnt really surprising but some might think its kind of cheesy. For me, it is all part of the ambiance. The service at Doubledays was not great however. It seemed like there was basically one very busy lady running around taking care of every table in the place. While she did admirably it was just kind of unsettling to see her buzzing around here and there all night. At least she got our fish out when it was hot and fresh, I give her props for that.Doubledays also offers an AYCE Fish and Chicken buffet but I find these can be hit and miss. One thing that did impress me was the fact that the (somewhat young) chef/cook was at the buffet repeatedly checking on the freshness of the food. This is rare and made me feel like he was very attentive and that our food would be good as well, and it was. Overall this was a great Fish Fry there is not much more that needs to be said. Whether it is a Supper Club, a dive bar or in this case a bowling alley, you never know where great Fish Fry is going to show up so you need to actually try them for youself.

Of course, the reason I've been to the North Street staple so many times is because their fish specials are some of the best in the city and I just can't seem to get enough of them. Their bluegill, lake perch, and walleye are all wonderful, with the cod coming in just a tail behind. The bluegill and lake perch specials alternate on ""specials"" the menu with the perch winding its way to Wednesday and the bluegill falling on Fridays. This week we showed up on a Friday so, of course, it was a bluegill affair.Now, I say I've eaten Fish Fry at Dexter's well over 50 times, but of those 50 something times at least 30 of them have been the superior sunfish. I simply love the stuff, and while it's always great, I think today's batch of bluegill might have been the single greatest batch ever (and I'm not even joking). This panfish was nothing short of incredible. Each and every one of the 10 tiny divers was tender and moist with the absolute lightest breading imaginable. It was so perfectly fried and so delicious that I swear I saw heaven in those tiny canoe shaped fillets even if just for a moment. The waffle fries on the side (or under the pile of fish as it were) were also spot on and went blow-for-blow with the benevolent bluegills. The portion was princely and each crunchy morsel supplied a welcome textural change to the plush fish. Of course, these spuds are never short on seasoning which is something I personally can't get enough of. For those wanting to dial it back there are always brew fries available, and for those feeling even friskier the garlic-chili are also a people pleaser - think minced garlic and chili oil, and thank me later.Dexter's house tartar has grown by leaps and bounds over the years and currently sits as some of the best you will find in our fair city. It's a surprisingly diverse blend, but has all the hallmarks of a thick and rich classic supper club sauce. Like the tartar, Dexter's slaw has evolved over time, and while it's still not perfect it's far better than it used to be. This is a vinegar-based slaw that has a disproportionate amount of onion in it, to the point where that's about all you'll notice. While that could be a problem for some, the strong flavor relates to the real rye bread that come along making for a modern combo that hearkens back to the flavors of the traditional Milwaukee Fish Fry. Dexter's has received numerous accolades for their Friday Fish Fry, including the coveted Best of Madison among others, and I for one am not going to complain. I think the is one of the best Fish Frys in town, and this visit only served to cement that opinion even further. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and think it somehow keeps getting better with age if that is even possible. www.dexterspubmadison.com/301 North StreetMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-3535",2944,0.31527142857142854,0.5515857142857145

It used to be their menu shifted around a bit, with bluegill one week and lake perch the next which made it hard to tell what to expect on any given Friday (or Wednesday for that matter). All that has seemingly changed recently with Fridays featuring cod, bluegill, and walleye; while  lake perch is consistently, and exclusively, part of their Wednesday lineup. We went a couple Wednesdays in a row recently and were tickled pink with the perch plates.Both of these trips basically yielded the exact same results (save for the potato option) so I'll just roll the reviews into one (save for the potato part). The perch at the Pub comes six to an order and are 100% the genuine article yellow perch. Each lovely little panfish is dusted with a light flour breading that has just enough seasoning to let you know it's there while still allowing the inherent perch flavor shine through. This is the good stuff and among the best perch you're likely to find this side of Minoqua. We almost exclusively go for the waffle fries when we visit North Street since they are the best around, but the garlic chili fries we opted for on the 12th may have just stolen the thunder. These babies get a subtle heat from the chili oil, which pairs surprisingly well with the pungent garlic aromas. Of times, they drown the shoestring cuts in the oil (which necessitates a fork and/or slick fingers), but this round had just enough to keep the fries crisp. It was a prefect balance and one that has me leaning G-C from here on out. Just as the menu has stabilized Dexter's has found the sweet spot with their tartar. For a while it was a hit and miss mix, but they're crushing it every time now. Thick, creamy, zesty, sweet...this stuff has it all and then some. They are also one of the only places in town willing to roll with the rye bread, and although it was a little stale on both recent visits (likely holdovers from the previous Friday), it's still better (and more traditional) than a dinner roll. The slaw still has onion overtones, but those notes strike the rye just right. Consistency is king when it comes to Fish Fry, and Dexter's has hit their stride. They are out-distancing much of the competition making it easy to see why they are in the running (and winning) Best of Madison competitions year after year.

Both visits were stellar (as expected) and both featured freshwater fish (also as expected).We'll start with the $16 bluegill during the tap takeover and we'll also start by saying we love Indeed's beers...if you like ""craft"" and have never tried theirs we'd highly recommend you do. As far as the fish goes, it was simply superb. Each of the 9-10 tiny fillets were light and smooth with an equally light and pleasant breading. Just enough of the fishy bluegill flavor comes through to let you know it's the genuine article without being overbearing. It's GOLD, Jerry! Dexter's is no slouch when it come to sides and their waffles are the gold standard...I'm sensing a theme here. They are heavily-seasoned to a rich amber color and come in a portion that would make Zeus blush. The same goes for the gilded tartar which takes the cake when it comes to creaminess. Is thick and bold, and offsets the seasoning in the fish just right. Some oh-so-traditional rye does the deed and the onion-laden slaw pays the piper. Separate they might turn some folks off, but together they rise to the top. When you couple everything with the quartet of high-octane IBC beers all went smoothly and I left feeling on top of my game. Our Wednesday night rendezvous was more of the same, except this time it was lake perch that found its way to our table. Like the bluegill from a couple weeks prior the perch runs $16 and is essentially perchfect (see what I did there?). The six fillets are light and fresh tasting with the wispiest breading you could imagine...almost like gold dust. The fish itself was slightly sweet and not fishy in any way shape or form. It would make a prefect foray into freshwater fish for those fearful of fishy flavors who may be stuck in the cod rut. Just as it does to the 'gill the tartar takes the perch to the top of the podium with its thick consistency and pungent flavor. This round we went for the brew fries since the little man was with and he has waffled on the waffle fry seasoning in the past and we wanted him to have a fall-back. The brews are fine but take the silver when the aurelian lattices are around. The same Friday slaw comes on Wednesday and this one was packed in the cup like a fresh tub of Play-Doh and didn't want to relinquish it's hold. The rye also seemed like a holdover from the previous Friday as it was a little stale - certainly not the gold standard by any stretch. It may come as a shock to some but Dexter's recently took the gold medal as the Best of Madison Fish Fry and I for one don't totally disagree. Sure, there are a lot of great contenders but for me this one has it all - fantastic freshwater fish, superb spuds, terrific tartar, special slaw, real rye, and an outstanding beer selection. That's the full meal deal and the full Friday Fish Fry experience (they also have a good whiskey selection and make a good brandy old fashioned sweet as far as I've heard). Overall, we highly recommend these Fish Frys and will come back periodically for their ""Au""some fish.

I say, another (Fry)day, another Dexter's. I've rekindled a relationship with Dexter's recently partially due to their fantastic beer selection, but mostly due to the spectacular fish options. This time I went for the walleye and a side of their garlic-chili fries, ya know, just to shake things up...The walleye comes in at 18 beans, which isn't cheap, but is pretty much par for the course when you are talking about REAL walleye. The fillet also isn't the biggest you will find but it basically checks every other box. It's light, it's flaky, it's a good two inches on the fat side, and perfectly crispy on the thin side. It also has a nice light breading that lets the fish shine though and sticks to your fingers if you let it. It's just good stuff, plain and simple. Dexter's waffle fries are my muse, but once in a while I like to cheat with the slick and sassy garlic-chili upgrade. These babies are as unique as fries get and ooze almost as much charisma as chili juice. They'll soak the whole plate (including the batter on your fish) if you're not careful, but if you proactively manage them by dredging each fry through the pool they can be controlled. It's control worth having too... The homemade tartar at Dexter's is a celebration of flavors and really drives the fish home. There are lots of goodies hiding in there which add up to more than the sum of their parts. It's a banger, that's for sure. The slaw comes pre-packed into a four oz Solo cup which allows the juice to settle and the top to dry out. Do your best to mix it without spilling because you want it wet, but you also don't want to lose a single morsel. It's good, and adds a refreshing lightness to what some might perceive as a heavy meal. And last is the rye, because Dexter's. That's why. I've never really had a bad Fish Fry at Dexter's, but it sounds like a lot of folks have and all I can say is that's a bummer, man. Maybe it's the fact that I stick to the freshwater fish, and most people get the cod (which in my experience isn't quite at the same level)? Regardless, Dexter's does it for me and I'll keep coming back until they don't. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry, and love just about everything Dex does. www.dexterspubmadison.com/301 North StreetMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-3535",2327,0.2187407407407408,0.5178112874779542

It was hard to put our finger on exactly what was missing, but the once omnipresent edge wasn't there anymore. Sure, there were still tons of great beers, and the food did it's job, but it wasn't an eye-opener like it used to be. Dexter's had settled into a rut for good, or so we thought... Maybe we just lucked out, or maybe there's a new cook in town, but whatever the case the spice came back today. The bluegill and waffle fries were on point, and brought back everything we loved so much back in the day. Someone clearly found the salt shaker again as the breading brought back all the oomph that had been fading over the years. At least 10 fillets lorded over the plate and put all their subjects in order with a well-seasoned scepter. It was simply superb stuff and the flavor I'd been longing for. The waffles fries also go their groove back with the pungent seasoning of olde. I can tell you unequivocally that something had changed because they were ""too spicy"" according MFF Jr. and he had been gobbling them up with no hesitation on previous visits. It was just fine with me as the bevy of starchy lattices kept me satisfied, and despite the fact there were almost as many crumbs floating around under the full grids they were no less appealing. YES! Dexter's potent tartar really put the fish on ice with it's creamy classic flavor, while the half slab of marble rye made me really happy with its presence alone. A 4 oz cup of their homemade slaw also seemingly reverted to the days of yore with less of the onion-y overtones we've become accustomed to. This blast from the past suited me just fine although even the onion-laced version blends well with the rye. I have no idea what happened on this trip to the North Street mainstay, but I'm certainly glad it did. It was an all-around unexpected surprise and exactly how I hope things go down from here on out! Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and pray the sass is here to stay. www.dexterspubmadison.com/301 North StreetMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-3535",2158,0.23485746352413017,0.4160516273849605

Well, that, and I was going to make sure it was great walleye. Well, that, and I was going to make sure it was at a place I wouldn't have to go too far out of my way for. A few places came to mind that fit that bill - the Villa Tap (their walleye is always so good, but if I went there I might be tempted by the lake perch and not get the walleye at all), or the Tip Top (their walleye is great too, but I just had it not all that long ago), or Dexter's (theirs is also excellent, it seemed like eons since I'd enjoyed it, AND they have fancy beers). That settled it, great walleye and a fancy beer at Dexter's was the answer.Walleye is a premium fish, and the lord of the lake has steadily risen in price over the years; Dexter's fillet currently sits at a hearty $18. Still, 18 beans isn't out of line with what you find most anywhere else, and since Dexter's sustainably sources their walleye, paying a little more is little price to pay. As per usual we came for lunch (the dinner rush is a bit much with a 4 year old) and as per usual the plate looked impeccable. The walleye fillet was actually on the small side, but not a baby by any means (it was likely in the 8-10 oz range instead of the 12-14 that you often see). The meat was as flaky as can be and cradled ever so gently by a light breading that clung perfectly but lacked some of the seasoning we've come to know and love. Uncharacteristically, it also leaked a little grease which left a kiddie pool on the plate. The errant oil wasn't enough to make the breading slough off the surface, but was enough to make my fingers sticky (and not necessarily the intriguing Fruit Roll-up stickiness of old). The side of record on North Street are the waffle fries and these grids never fail to impress. While the portion was scaled back to some extent they were all large cuts which meant there were no nubbins floating around. These spuds are well-seasoned, expertly fried, and pack a satisfying crunch. Dexter's homemade tartar also keeps 'em happy with a thick consistency and pungent flavor. It's a good one and has been for almost as long as I can remember. A heap of slaw took was formed to the cup it came in not unlike the tin can cranberry sauce at Thanksgiving. It was a a dry mix and lacked the onion blast we've become accustomed to (and somewhat enjoy). It was kind of uninspiring but bolstered to some extent by the half slice crusty rye that needed to be ripped apart like a wild dog on a hunk of meat. Going into any Friday with a predetermined mindset can be dangerous, but luckily for me I knew Dexter's had my back. Sure, there is other walleye in the area but theirs in consistently good and they hit the mark yet again. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and will swim back the next time we want to land a big one and crunch some of those oh-so-delicious waffle fries. www.dexterspubmadison.com/301 North StreetMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-3535",2996,0.22136807181889148,0.5112334113973458

There are just people out there who love to root for the underdog no matter the case, and there are times I'd include myself among them...except when it come to the Fish Fry at Dexter's. I don't get any of the animosity they seem to draw these days.Of course, no restaurant is immune to an off-day or even an off-plate for that matter, but for me Fish Fry is all about consistency and Dexter's hits the mark much more often that they miss it. Sure, I've had one or two there that haven't been amazing, but even those have been better than many places best efforts. This Friday I had the bluegill (again), and not only was it better than most (again), but it was one of the best (and prettiest) plates I've seen...and I've seen my share. The bluegill goes for $15 and the 8 Lake Erie sourced fillets were succulent. They gracefully rolled across a landscape of waffle fries with their light, and I do mean LIGHT, breading. The practically translucent crust allowed the fragile fish to shine bright and it took center stage with its alluring essence and flaky, yet firm meat. It was a total winner and one I can't imagine anyone would disapprove of (although I'm sure there's some objector out there who would find some sort of issue). Stellar stuff. Waffle fries are a dime a dozen, but Dexter's versions are worth at least twice that. These are easily the best waffles I've had anywhere and apparently my 3 year old concurs (he ate about half of my stack). The lattices are coated in a zesty seasoning that makes them ultra-crispy which plays politely with the plush potato parts. Dexter's homemade tartar isn't the thickest on the block, but really packs a wallop. It's a very diverse mix, but so well blended you can't really pick it apart. The slaw is normally much easier to dissect, but it was missing its usual onion overtone this week. Thankfully, it still kept its allure and paired well with the scaled-back half slice of rye. If I had to wager a guess, I'd say the people who decry Dexter's Fish Fry do so because they came in when they were swamped, had a lengthy wait, then got fish that was fried in overused oil resulting in a greasy rendition without much flavor. I can empathize with that, and it's part of the reason why I normally skip the dinner rush and come for lunch instead. This week we were pretty much the first duo of the day at 11am and everything was fresh and fast as lighting. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and think it's about as consistent as they come.

In fact, they tout the fact that they won the Best of Madison award in the category and with good reason - it's tasty, it's consistently good, and it's unique enough that it sets itself apart from the run-of-the-mill cod specials out there. We actually hadn't been there for over six months and sort of forgot what we'd been missing...we won't make that mistake again.The impetus for this visit to the North Street staple was a tap takeover from the Indeed Brewing Company in conjunction with the typical Friday features. I showed up early to get my hands on some of that sweet LSD (a Lavendar, Sunflower Honey, and Dates ale), and was a couple deep before old Gabe sauntered in and we transitioned from the bar to a bar-side table. In no time his cod was ordered and my bluegill beckoned and we shot the $hit. The fish arrived in pristine condition and looked every bit as good as I remember. Bluegill can have some overtly fishy flavors, but this Canadian-born batch was as smooth and mild as they come. There was nothing wacky in the taste department and the texture was flaky and pure - no rubber band effect here. While Dex isn't giving their lightly-breaded beauties away ($15), that price is competitive and when you consider it is from a sustainable source (or at least they claim) it feels justified. A spud-head through and through, I swoon over hand-cut fries but welcome all comers as long as they are all they can be - Dexter's waffles fries are. These starchy lattices are hefty as can be and the maximized amount of surface area allows for ample seasoning to be applied. They are simply wonderful in every sense of the word. Like most of the food at Dexter's the tartar is the good stuff and always in the zone. The thick and creamy blend bathes the bluegill in benevolence, bequeathing bliss upon bloated bellies. Some radical rye follows in the Milwaukee-style Fish Fry tradition, while an onion-y slaw sets it off. Dexter's definitely still has it and while I don't necessarily think it's ""the best"" I'd have a hard time arguing with anyone who does. This is a great one, no ifs ands or buts about it. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and you can bet your sweet bippy it won't be six months before we're back again. www.dexterspubmadison.com/301 North StreetMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-3535",2405,0.28640816326530616,0.5316190476190475

Once in a while we'll get together over fish and shoot the breeze. Usually it's at one of the places we used to frequent while working together like Wilson's, the Villa Tap, or Dexter's, and today the Earthlings had the later on the brain.Dexter's is basically a can't-miss Fry and has enough option to keep everyone happy, including cod, freshwater fish, and baked options. On our most recent visit the bluegill had returned, but it was absent again this Friday so we just defaulted to its freshwater brethren the lake perch. The LP runs $15, which is about average in 2017 and comes in the average portion of six. Since we had a reasonably large group it took a reasonably long time to get our grub, but that didn't mean it sat around. The Great Lakes Lake Perch were obviously the real deal as Dexter's prides themselves on disclosing their suppliers. The sextet of swimmers was slightly over-fried leaving them crispy rather than supple with a breading that was missing most of its signature seasoning. Still, it was better than most of what's out there, but not quite a top 25er in our book. We've stumped for Dexter's waffles fries for years and this batch hit the mark flavor-wise, but fell short in numbers. There were probably only ten full-sized lattices on the plate with tons of nubbins beneath them. It as a disappointing display to be sure. Dexter's tartar is as homemade as they come and also as tasty. It has a big, bold zip and clings to the fish like a wood tick on a German Shepard. They also provide plenty of real rye, which pairs perfectly with onion-y coleslaw. These two are the Fred and Ginger and the Fish Fry...they dance like angels and make each other way better than they would be on their own. while some of the polish has certainly worn of Dexter's apple, this Fish Fry still speaks for itself. It has everything you expect and a few things you don't, and most importantly it's all balanced.

Some days you just want to shake things up. Some days you can see whats ahead and know something special needs to be done. This was one of those days. It was a Wednesday. It was sunny and pleasant. But most importantly of all it was the day before Thanksgiving, which inevitably meant a Friday Fish Fry wasnt in our future. So we did what needed to be done, and paid Dexters a visitand what a visit it turned out to be.It seems like eons since we last had bluegill at Dexters, but through some twist of divine fate it was back today. Like Christ rising from the dead it had inexplicably returned to bathe us in its glory and subtle fishy flavors. $14 seemed like a measly pittance when we contemplated all the satisfaction it would bring so we gladly obliged and even upgraded to a side of garlic-chili fries. Some of the polish appears to have worn off Dexters proverbial apple, and the lunch crowd was sparse to say the least. For us that meant our food was ready in the blink of an eye and served steam rising from their tender little loins. Four fish made up the allotment resulting in eight superbly seasoned, lightly breaded beauties. The sodium quotient seemed to be bumped up a notch, which was excellent since weve become accustomed to it being less-so recently. The salty breading offset the bluegill essence perfectly and was further enhanced by the slightly snappy texture - a little snap, a little pull, but nothing rubbery. This is the good stuff. The garlic-chili fries came on their own plate which was a huge plus since it kept the pungent oil from saturating the delicate crust of the fish. The plentiful juice bathed the crispy spuds in spicy goodness necessitated a fork feeding, which we usually frown upon, but in this case well make an exception. The subtle heat and a pungent garlic blast was well worth it. Dexters has some of the biggest and boldest tartar sauce in the business and the bluegill is better for it. This sassy number really offsets the well-seasoned fillets perfectly and highlights the subtle fishy flavors without burying them all together. Rye seems to be making a comeback on Friday diner plates, but Dexters isnt a follower, they set the pace. Theyve been on the rye train since day one, and designed an onion-y coleslaw to go along with it. Its a match made in Fish Fry heaven and pays homage to the real deal Milwaukee-style Fish Fry of yesteryear. We thought Dexters bluegill had gone the way of the proverbial dodo, but apparently it just went into hiding for a while. Unfortunately, without keeping an eye on the Daily Specials section of their site theres no way to know when its around, but I guess if we want it bad enough well just have  to do what we have to do.

I wasnt sure what hed been up to, and I know he didnt care what Id been doing, but I figured we might as well get together. Id eat some of his fish, hed enjoy my company (and my hard earned cash) and wed live like it was 2012. Yup, MFF and Dexter were together again.Dexters biggest draw used to be their bluegill (for me anyway), but for whatever reason it seems to have been phased out for good. Walleye, lake perch, and cod are all that remain as far as real Fish Fry fish are concerned and today we went walleye. We were a little on the short side of twelve but even at that time they were not busy at all. Maybe some of the mystique has worn off or maybe the prices have just gotten too rich for some peoples blood, but whatever the case may be we were one of the few. The fish was still good so I know quality isnt the issue. In classic Dexters fashion the big walleye fillet takes precedence with the signature sticky breading that makes it shine. While there wasnt as much seasoning as there once was it still has the perfect texture. The fish itself was superbly flaky and looked like it was straight out of a textbook, if such a thing existed. Weve long loved Dexters waffle fries and this crew were they usual suspects although, like the breading on the fish, they seemed to be missing a bit of seasoning. Still, they were crunchy and munchy, and erased from the plate by my gigantic Friday appetite. A signature sauce is one of the defining characteristics of the best Fish Frys and Dexters blend is different from any you will find. Its a tad sweeter and has a few more elements that set it apart. Pimiento anyone? The sauce is definitely good on its own, but really sparkles when slathered on the flaky fish. A half slice of rye puts me in the right mood, and mixes well with the onion-y overtones in the house made slaw. Its a big flavor combo which is something most places dont seem to think too much about in 2016. Its always good to see old friends, and especially good when those friends make amazing fish. While we miss some things about Dexters (specifically the bluegill) there is still so much here to love that wed be fools to stay away. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and think you just cant go wrong. Is it the best of the best? Maybe not, but its not too far from it, and is enough to keep us coming back time and time again.

From the moment I laid eyes on it a magical love affair ensued. I would order it, it would be delicious, and we were both oh so happy. I thought wed be together forever, but like so many relationships things changed as the late aughts morphed into the early teens. Dexters rarely (if ever) has bluegill on their menu anymore so were forced to settle for its freshwater brethren the lake perch. Settle being the operative word. Luckily for us, settling for the lake perch is the equivalent of choosing a ribeye over a fillet mignon. Both are great, and really depend on individual taste to decide which is better. Since we were the first duo of the day, our $15 plate was ready in no time and looked pretty much perfect. The bunch o perch were definitely the real deal yellow perch. They were small and crinkly and curled lengthwise in the fryer into little canoes of love. While there wasnt a ton of seasoning in the breading it had just the right texture and was a consistent as they come. Usually Id opt for the waffle fries, but I splurged by upgrading to the garlic-chili fries for an extra buck fifty. Unfortunately, the slick spuds came sans-sauce leaving them as just the standard brew fries. While not what I ordered, its hard to complain about them as the crunchy shoestrings are perfectly crispy and offset the flaky fish just right. Dexters tartar has plenty of bang for the buck and really takes the fish to the next level. Its clearly made in-house and easily some of the best there is. It has no unnecessary additions (like capers), but still tastes diverse which is the mark of a great tartar. Ds P is one of the only places in town that serves real rye with their Fry, and while the slice today tasted a little stale, it was still better than what most places trot out and way better than nothing (which a lot of places try and get away with). Slaw should never be the focus of any Fish Fry and Dexters knows that. Their oniony mix plays a supporting role, and while not perfect, is alluring with its strange watery creaminess. The onion overtones really offsets the rye making for a traditional flavor combo that many dont fully appreciate. While our love for Dexters bluegill is currently unrequited, we hope its only a temporary hiatus. Fortunately we have a friend in their lake perch and are glad that its there to fall back on.

With these specific criteria only a handful of came to mind, and the first place to pop was Dexters. With demand comes higher prices and the cost of the Great Lakes Lake Perch keeps on a-climbin. It now sits at a hefty 16 bones but not one of those dollar goes towards actual marrow. These petite perch are perfectly filleted leaving only delightfully delicate and flaky meat. While I didnt count the actual number of fillets there were a lot of them since each was pretty small. Regardless of their stature, they were stellar - smooth and mild, devoid of any fishy flavors, and paired with expertly executed breading. Thin yet crisp, flavorful yet not overly pungent, this stuff delivers the goods. It adds oh-so-much to the fish without overshadowing it whatsoever, which is the mark of true frying mastery. Even though it was the New Year I felt inclined to stick with an old standby in Dexters wonderful waffle fries. These lattices are in a league of their own and are truly the Silver Slugger of spuds. Their crispy coating crushes the competition and drive the Fry home every time. Of course, there are more than enough of them to go around with each hulking slab being a more than meets the eye. After polishing off the original portion I almost ordered an additional side of them as we sat and had a couple more beers, and Im not even kidding about that. Them shits is tasty. Dexters tartar is also a no-doubt slam dunk and while the perch is easily good enough to be eaten solo it becomes a little something more when slathered with the special sauce. Great things happen when relish and pimiento meet the other elements in the diverse blend, making for some of the best sauce in this, or any other city. Rye rye, baby, rye ryeDex has a ticket to rye and he dont care (if you like it or not).  The big, soft half slab suits me just fine and makes one Dexters one of the few places in the city mainlining a stranglehold on the most traditional of Fish Fry starches. When you pile that sucker high with a bit of Dexters now-signature, onion-laced, homemade slaw, subtle homage is paid to the days of a big old slice of rye with a whole slice of raw onion laid on top. While that was before my time I have an appreciation for this attempt at honoring history while evolving to meet the demands of the modern Fish-going public. To say we started 2016 off right would be an understatement as we may well have started it off in the absolute best way possible. We got reacquainted with our old friend Dexter and introduced another friend to all he has to offer. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and place it squarely amongst the best in Madison. Dexters does it all, its a simple as that. www.dexterspubmadison.com/301 North StreetMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-3535",3067,0.23138069676802064,0.4980135592107423

What happened to Dexters!? It used to just be a divey little spot with peeling linoleum and stained ceiling tiles that served and under-the-radar but amazing Fish Fry. My how things have changed. They now have fancy-schmancy beer boards, new flooring, and neon liquor shelves. Thank god theres still some of those stained ceiling tiles or I might not even know I was in the same place. This aint your grandpas Dexters.All kidding aside, most of the changes made at Dexters are for the better. While they exterior looks the same as it always has the interior now feels clean and modern, and of course, they still have their Best of Madison Friday Fish Fry  although even that has evolved somewhat. Ive always been a sucker for Dexters bluegill, and truth be told thats why I came today. To my surprise not only was the gill absent from the specials but so was the lake perch! Standing in was what has come to be known as Dexters Wednesday Menu which has crappie instead of the other freshwater-ers. I was astonished, but since Id wanted to try the crappie (but never go out on Wednesdays) I seized the opportunity to do so. Like its freshwater friends the crappie isnt cheap at $14, but the portion is handsome and the plate is filled out. Crappie looks a lot like lake perch although the fillets are slightly larger, thicker, and more oval-shaped. In addition, the meat tastes more fishy than perch and isnt as flaky. The mushier texture isnt bad, but it just doesnt quite live up to its counterparts which is probably one reason its rarely seen as a Friday special. Of course, its home to the same breading as the rest of Dexs fish (cod aside) which gives the limp fish something firm to hold on to. All things considered its still very good, but a step below the lake perch, and a few more from the bluegill.Thankfully, the sides are the same as always and the waffle fries were as amazing as ever. Sure, the portion seemed trimmed, but the seasoning was dead on and the time the spent in the fryer was just right. The tartar was also in the zone, although appeared to be chunkier than usual. The robust blend did the fish right with plenty of zip and no overbearing flavors. Dexters has also historically been one of the few places in town willing to serve rye with their fish and the big half slice stayed the course. It was stanky and fresh and well-suited to the homemade coleslaw. While the onion quotient has been dialed down this slaw is still as diverse as they come although not the best around. You cant win em all. Holy crap(pie)! Dexters is still great even with all the changes theyve made. While its not a dive anymore it still has a charm that sets it apart from chain restaurants or overly modern places that feel cold, and of course, their Fish Fry is still amazing. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry but do hope the perch and bluegill return at some point. www.dexterspubmadison.com/301 North StreetMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-3535",3007,0.15775467587967584,0.5010291097791097

Fish Fry #1000! And where else would you expect it to be than Dexters Pub!? Sure, a few other places crossed my mind when I thought about where to celebrate such a momentous occasion. Maybe I should go to the place Ive been to more than any other  Wilsons; or maybe I should go to the place with the single tastiest fish  the Villa Tap; or maybe I should go to one of the places that have it all  Crawfish Junction or Tobys? Any of those would have been fine choices, but I had to pick my current go-to  Bluegill and waffle fries at Dexters. Its simply a cant-miss Fish Fry, and the last thing I wanted was #1000 to be a miss. I always do Dexters for lunch since dinner has basically evolved into a Friday night free-for-all. During lunch they are nowhere near as busy and the food always comes freshly fried. A plethora of small fillets arrived splayed over a hearty pile of waffle fries and might look slapdash to some, but those in-the-know know better. The fish is everything bluegill should be complete with a subtle fishiness and a well-seasoned, tissue-thin breading. The waffle fries are just one of Dexters many outstanding sides and continue to be as on point as ever. Their satisfying crunch is complemented by their superb seasoning making for some seriously superior spuds. The homemade tartar is as zesty as they come and easily picks up any slack the fish lets out. A little rye goes a long way and this half slab is just enough. It pairs nicely with the Dexters slaw which happened to be a little creamier, and lighter on the onion than that in the recent past. While I can honestly say I never expected to eat 1000 Fish Frys in a little over 10 years I can also say that its been a blast doing so. Whether its freshwater fish or an oceanic variety Ive grown to appreciate what makes each and every one of them unique and special. Overall, we highly recommend the bluegill at Dexters and think its one of the most special of all and easily worth of the big 1K. www.dexterspubmadison.com/301 North StreetMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-3535",2086,0.17012458471760794,0.4915079365079366

The walleye goes for sixteen bucks and fifty cents more if you want a side of onion rings like I did. This round was pretty much everything Ive come to expect from Dexters. One big old piece of pristine walleye with a light, sticky breading ruled the roost. The fish was flaky as can be and tasty as all get out. It was simply a stellar piece of fish and easily some of the best walleye available this side of the Mississippi. While the rings are an upcharge they are well worth it if youre in the mood like I was. The portion is hearty and the flavor distinctive  almost a smoky in a way. Any Fish Fryer knows that delicious fishes are made ever more delectable by a transcendent tartar and Dexters home brew is all that and then some. It has a thick consistency and plenty of pop which complements the flaky perfectly. Real rye bread is the essence of the Fish Fry and Dexters knows it as well as any. They have it, they serve it, I love it. Pungent slaw is ryes best friend and Dexters onion-heavy mix is as chummy as they come. The two work together in harmony and add a major element that many other Fish Frys lack. Dexters knows what they are doing and its really as simple as that. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and think its still one of Madisons finest. www.dexterspubmadison.com/301 North StreetMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-3535",1559,0.27523333333333333,0.45277460317460316

Likewise, if you ever find yourself at Dexters Pub do the same  its like Canada South, theres bluegill everywhere!While that might not be 100% true, the Canadian Bluegill at Dexters is pretty remarkable and will make you feel like its all around you. The $13.00 plate comes packed with nine or so of the small fillets and theyre nothing short of pure munching pleasure. The mild fish is kissed by a light breading with just the right amount of seasoning to make you stand up and say, Oh Canada! Its a dish of bliss especially when accompanied by a big old handful of Dexters signature waffle fries. If spud cruncher is your name, then these waffles are your game. They are crispy yet supple with a spicy coating that makes you wonder what everyone else is doing wrong. They are perfect as far as waffle fries go, and will have you grinning from ear to ear and bite to bite. I promise. The perfection extends to Dexters homemade tartar which is big and bold, and complements any of their fish (especially the bluegill) perfectly. Its a classic blend but has a little something extra to go along with a thickness quotient that has increased dramatically over the years. This stuff is like glue, but way tastier (unless youre a 5 year old, then thats up for debate). Like so few places in town Dexters pairs their fish with a slice of real rye bread, and while it may miss the modernist palate, the Fish Fry purist in me cant get enough. Its got all that stank, and pairs oh so well with Dexters equally pungent homemade, onion-loaded slaw. Its what Fish Fry is all about. Well, besides the fish While Canada might be where bluegill originates its home is clearly at Dexters. This is some of the finest fish Madison has to offer and will keep you coming back for moreand moreand more. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and think its pretty gosh darn great, eh. www.dexterspubmadison.com/301 North StreetMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-3535",2036,0.19044261294261292,0.5129812779812779

Its amazing because of the variety of delicious fish available and maddening because you can only choose one of the outstanding options any given Friday. Its always a tough decision to make and one I struggle with each and every time.This trip was no different and despite the fact that I adore the bluegill, love the lake perch, and swoon over the walleye I forced myself to order the Bering Sea Cod because I hadnt had it for so long. The cod is the cheapest of school coming in at $11 and since I was the first order of the day the oil was smoldering hot and fried it fast. As expected, the cod was good, although surprisingly greasy. It was actually a bit of a grease bomb and although the ooze seeped all the way through the batter it didnt destroy it. The fish itself was flaky and pure and while the batter was a tad thick, it had a great flavor which enhanced the flaky meat. It was bolstered even further by the homemade tartar sauce which is a nearly perfect mix. After their encounter the sheen of the remnant oil danced on the skin of the sultry sauce, not unlike a recent photo of a certain Kardashian sister. It dazzled the eyes and the taste buds causing an almost preternatural instinct to scoop it up by fish, by finger, or by whatever means available. It was alluring, it was intoxicating, it was the essence of the Fish Fry. Staying with the sauce, it comes in a 2 oz. cup which is more than adequate for the freshwater fish, but comes up short on the three beefy pieces of cod. When fish is a little greasy it begs for tartar and by piece three its wishes went unfulfilled making the last few bites slightly less desirable. Dexters sides are a force to be reckoned with and the garlic-chili fries brought the goods today. The shoestring cuts make an ideal foundation for the blend of throaty garlic and peppy chili oil resulting in a great flavor combo that lasts and lasts. It is a massive portion of spuds, and I do mean MASSIVE. A thick half-slice of real rye really beefs things up as well, and while Dexters has had a ticket to rye for years now this rendition was a solid step up from the thin slab of yesterday. The same old oniony and pungent slaw finished things off and while its so-so solo it pairs perfectly with the stanky rye. Dexters is just one of those places that has it all figured out. They make great fish, have stellar sides, and fill things out in all the right ways without cutting corners to do so. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and have no qualms about calling it one of the best in town.

Or, on second thought, should I even begin? There really isnt anything else I can say about the Fish Fry at Dexters at this point. Its simply great, but you already knew that. Dexters used to fly under the radar, but all that has changed now. The place is swamped on Friday nights which is why I usually go for lunch when the crowd is much sparser and the service much quicker. Ive had all the fish options many times (except for the new Sablefish which Im a little leery of), so this time it was simply a matter of suiting my fancy, and today I fancied walleye. The fish came before half of my PBR was even gone (PBR was the cheap beer on tap, Im not one of those guys), and looked marvelous. The fillet was average-sized but plus-taste. The Canadian sourced cut was moist and flaky and enhanced to the utmost by Dexters signature breading. The sticky coating clung to fish and finger alike with herculean force despite its brittle appearance. The seasoning blend in the breading enhanced every last bit of the meat making for a true taste sensation. Dexters has great side options and while Ive availed myself of most of them I always come back to the waffle fries. The portion today was on the light side number-wise but on the heavy side size-wise. Each tater lattice seemed to be center-cut with plenty of potato-y goodness to offset the spicy coating applied post-fry. As Ive said many times before, these waffles are the stick by which all others should be measured. A hearty dose of Dexters smooth and zippy tartar joined the fold, and bolstered the lineup significantly. While the walleye was just fine on its own, a dunk in the special sauce took it to the next level. The coleslaw is homemade, and unlike any youll find elsewhere. Its fresh, and peppy, but punctuated by an onion overtone that is too pungent for some. Thankfully, Dexters pairs the slaw with a half-slice of rye that helps to take the edge off, at least when theyre eaten in unison.Look, you already know Dexters is great. Do I really need to keep harping on it? No, probably not, but there is something to be said for a place that never misses a beat, never drops the ball, and consistently puts out plate after place of perfect fish. Its amazing, I love it, and I keep coming back for a reason. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry, and just hope Dexters keep doing what Dexters does.  www.dexterspubmadison.com/301 North StreetMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-3535",2488,0.298487345987346,0.4726012876012876

I just cant get enough.Dexters does everything about Fish Fry right and they have a great selection of beers for those who are really into that sort of thing. They also have, or at least had, $1 pints of Old Mil this Friday and I couldnt help but sit and have a couple with a nice big old plate of walleye. While the fish was on the pricey side at $15 the cheap beer kept the tab manageable and I left one happy camper. Like all fish at Dexters the walleye is wild-caught, and simply superb. The filet this time around was large and meaty, almost too big to be believed. It was home to Dexters signature light breading that has just the right amount of flavor to let the pike shine through, and shine it did. There was so much flaky meat that many would shy away part way through and ask for a doggy bag, but I gleefully kept ripping and chomping until every last flake was devoured. Like Homer and his Yodel, it was so good I wish I was eating it right now. Dexters is all about choice (as evidenced by their huge tap beer and fish selections) so you know there are plenty of sides to choose from. We usually want the waffle fries and on occasion opt for the onion rings but today was all about the garlic-chili fries. The change of pace was welcome as the slick, zesty fries left a delightful chili-infused residue on the plate and in our heart. They were plentiful and scrumptious, and a welcome breather from the beloved waffles. A thick and creamy tartar makes any Fish Fry better and Dexters mix is flawlessly executed. While the walleye was great on its own the savory sauce really puts it into another dimension. A nice little bit of rye also comes along for the ride and pairs perfectly with Dexters homemade, oniony slaw. While its not the best slaw youll find, and too oniony for some, its always fresh and homemade and strikes a balance with the rye that I for one appreciate. Dexters used to be just another bar, but over time has become something much more. Its now one of Madisons best beer bars and best spots for a Fish Fry. And hey, if youre not into fancy taps of high-octane microbrews theres $1 taps of Old Mil or other regular beers. You just cant lose! Overall, we highly, highly, highly, recommend this Fish Fry and just cant get enough.

Like a fine wine, these things grow more nuanced and complex as time passes, providing increased pleasure for those with patience. Of course, Fish Fry is not immune to this phenomenon. Even though some places stagnate and are happy to stick with the same old-same old, other places go out of their way to improve the dining experience every single Friday. Dexters is such a place.Constant improvement has turned Dexters from a simple underground beer bar into a Fish Fry hotspot. Waits on Friday nights regularly exceed an hour, but since the same fish is served all day long those who know whats up simply show up at lunchtime instead. All of the fish on Dexters menu are currently wild caught in North American waters which is a nice touch, especially for the environmentally conscious among us. Dexters always has cod, lake perch, bluegill, and walleye on special on Fridays as well as a few other things like a catfish po boy. The bluegill goes for $12 and that is what we sampled this time around. The plate consists of seven pieces of the sunfish and all the usual sides. We begin with the fish, which is genuinely great. It features a light and flaky breading that is nothing short of marvelous. This well-seasoned coating covers the smooth and fresh tasting fish flawlessly making for near perfect munching. While some things in life simply beg to be improved upon Dexters waffle fries arent one of them. They are just flawless as is  crunchy, spicy, and generously portioned. Dexters tartar also has plenty of panache with a creamy consistency and fantastic zip that really adds something to the fish. Fish Fry purists expect some rye on the side and Dexters delivers with a tiny slice that does all it needs to do. The rye buddies up with some homemade slaw that serves as Dexters latest triumph. In months and years past their slaw has been the target of much contention. It was known to have too much onion and not enough punch, but things have finally changed. The current creamy mix still has the onion undertone but it has been substantially muted. The creamy, zesty, fresh mix is now pure enjoyment and easily Dexters best slaw yet. Patience is a virtue and those whove stuck with Dexters from their humble beginnings have been rewarded handsomely. They are currently offering some of the best fish in town and somehow manage to keep fine-tuning things for the better. Overall, we highly, highly, highly recommend this Fish Fry and will keep coming back until we have a good reason not to. www.dexterspubmadison.com/301 North StreetMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-3535",2686,0.24762711864406778,0.4874135469050722

They have one of the best all-around Fish Frys in town and when we dont want to take any chances they are one of the first places that comes to mind. We recently found ourselves at Dexters doorstep for lunch two Fridays in a row  the first being a solo visit and the second a reunion with the crew from WisSportsNet.Truth be told, things actually went a little smoother on the solo visit - the fish was hotter, it came much quicker, and the portion was larger all around. It was a little disconcerting on the follow up Fry but not totally unexpected when you consider groups are generally served all at once and coordinating that much fish can be difficult. On the first trip we went for the bluegill with a side of onion rings, while on the second we changed thing up with lake perch and waffle fries. The bluegill is buck cheaper than the lake perch, which works well for us since the bluegill is actually a bit tastier in our opinion. While both fish feature the same light breading, the seasoning works a little better with the fishier sunfish than the inoffensive perch. Regardless of which you prefer, both fish are smooth and flaky, with the light breeding you love, and the subtle fish flavor you crave. You really cant go wrong no matter which you choose. Dexters really does a number on the fish, but not at the expense of the sides. The onion rings we got with the bluegill were thick-cut and very tasty, but hard to keep in one piece (as onion rings so often are). They featured a crispy batter that had a rich, almost smoky, flavor. While we liked the rings enough, we still prefer Dexters waffle fries which are spicy and delicious, although were lacking in abundance when we ate with our friends. Besides the fish and the sides everything else was pretty much exactly the same between the two visits. The tartar was tremendous, featuring a thick and creamy mayo base with a great zip; the thick, soft half-slice of rye was radical (longtime Madisonians will get that reference); and the slaw was homemade and diverse. While some would say the ample onion overpowers the slaw, we think it pairs perfectly well with the pungent rye making a new flavor sensation that neither provides on its own. Weve heard some rumors recently that Dexters is slipping, and perhaps they are getting overwhelmed by the crowds on Friday nights. While we wouldnt go that far, it was pretty evident that there were some discrepancies between our solo visit and the trip we made with Nick, Rick, Travis, Norb, and Adam. Everything was a bit slower with the group and the portions suffered when served in bulk, but even those detractors arent enough to make this anything less than a stellar Fish Fry. Overall, we highly recommend both the bluegill and lake perch at Dexters and wont hesitate to come back for either... especially at lunch time. www.dexterspubmadison.com/301 North StreetMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-3535",2984,0.1311562344759066,0.48819347319347317

Besides the fish and the sides everything else was pretty much exactly the same between the two visits. The tartar was tremendous, featuring a thick and creamy mayo base with a great zip; the thick, soft half-slice of rye was radical (longtime Madisonians will get that reference); and the slaw was homemade and diverse. While some would say the ample onion overpowers the slaw, we think it pairs perfectly well with the pungent rye making a new flavor sensation that neither provides on its own. Weve heard some rumors recently that Dexters is slipping, and perhaps they are getting overwhelmed by the crowds on Friday nights. While we wouldnt go that far, it was pretty evident that there were some discrepancies between our solo visit and the trip we made with Nick, Rick, Travis, Norb, and Adam. Everything was a bit slower with the group and the portions suffered when served in bulk, but even those detractors arent enough to make this anything less than a stellar Fish Fry. Overall, we highly recommend both the bluegill and lake perch at Dexters and wont hesitate to come back for either... especially at lunch time. www.dexterspubmadison.com/301 North StreetMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-3535",2984,0.1311562344759066,0.48819347319347317

Rarely if ever do you find the most diminutive of frying fish, and when you do its usually at some sort of special event. It really is a shame since smelt has strong roots in Wisconsin and when fried just right offers a truly exceptional taste. If you can find an AYCE Smelt Fry like the one at the North Bristol Sportsmens Club make sure you go to it. Smelt are small and if the fish is good you are going to want to eat a good 20 to 30 or so of them, so having them portioned out ahead of time can really cramp ones style. Dexters has established itself as one of the preeminent Fish Fry joints in Madison and recently kicked off a Wednesday Night Fish Fry in an attempt to relieve some of the pressure on their Friday feed. We paid them a visit last week and had our choice of cod or walleye, but this week they changed things up a little bit, and I would say its definitely for the better. This week they still had the cod, but also added crappie (a little odd, but intriguing), and wait for it wait for it SMELT!!! Needless to say I was wasnt about to miss an opportunity to get my smelt on.While its not an AYCE smelt feed, Dex gives you around 12 fish for your 10 bucks. Its a good deal all things considered, and of course, it comes out steaming hot (Dexters would never server cold fish, theyre good like that). Unlike other smelt you might find, Dexters puts in some serious prep work to get the little buggers ready. Not only are the heads and tails chopped and the guts cleaned out, but they actually go the extra mile to fillet each and every one of them. From there they coat them in their signature light breading and fry them to golden-brown perfection. The fishy taste of the smelt is well complemented by Dexters spicy breading, and while the filleting causes them to be almost totally flat, it also causes them to be totally delicious. For a first soirée into smelt, Id say Dexters knocked it out of the park. Hopefully they stick with it. Even though there are a ton of side options I find it almost impossible to shy away from the waffle fries, and this round reiterated why. The pile of spicy spuds was huge, and delicious as all get out. They are literally the worlds perfect waffles and you simply cant do better. End of story. Some places use tartar to cover up the flavor of their fish, but Dexters diverse blend enhances the taste of the freshwater finsters rather than replacing it. Every iota of the thick mix was sopped up by the smelt and left me grinning from ear to ear. Even on Wednesday youll find a half-slice of rye with Dexters fish and while this piece was on the dry side, it was still the rye you like, and paired with a big cup of Dexters homemade slaw. Its a dynamic duo if ever there was one. Smelt can be a tough hill to climb, but, as expected, Dexters planted their flag at the summit without much difficulty. While Id like to see a few more of the tiny fish on the plate, the $10 price tag is fair when you consider all you get. Overall, we highly recommend the smelt at Dexters and really hope they keep it around. Its a nice change of pace from the usual Friday suspects, and gives Wednesday something special to hang its hat on. If it sticks around Ill definitely be back for it, you should give it a shot too. www.dexterspubmadison.com/301 North StreetMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-3535",3427,0.14419724295190717,0.5021902392797915

On Friday Dex rolls out the whole gamut of fish, but on Wednesday there is only cod and walleye to be found, which, in all fairness, is all most places do on Friday anyway. So I guess you could say a Wednesday Night Fish Fry are Dexters is as good as a Friday Night Fish Fry anywhere else.Of course, my cod came quickly, and why wouldnt it? It was a Wednesday after all, and unlike Friday night the place wasnt jam packed with people free to come and go as they pleased. The kitchen was also manned by one dude instead of three or four like you find on Friday. The cod was good, but like the Wednesday menu itself, has been scaled back somewhat. The pieces used to be a good four to five ounces each, and Id say this time around they were maybe three. Each was enrobed by a really dark beer batter, that was fried to the max, but not burned or anything like that. The fish underneath was super flaky, and paired nicely with the ultra-flavorful batter. While the batter looked daunting, it was surprisingly light, and very good, but not quite Owls Nest or Hooterville good. The side of record at Dexters is the waffle fries and this batch was massive. While the portion would be too much for some lightweights I crunched every last one of them without issue. They were pure spuduly perfection, and thats all Im going to say. The tartar was also great and has come a long way in a short amount of time. This sauce easily stands up to the flavorful fish although the cup is a little too small for all three pieces. I was scraping bottom about halfway through the second piece. Even on Wednesday Dexters brings their A-game as evidenced by the half-slice of rye bread. While you may not like rye, its what is expected by a Fish Fry purist and I had no problem mowing it down. It was all good, and all goneyou should really do yourself a favor and learn to like it. Like the tartar, Dexs slaw has come a long way over the years. What was once an abomination has become a strong suit and was the first thing I finished. The current mix is onion-y and juicy, and really complements the rye well. If youre sick of fighting the crowds on Friday nights, and I know many of you are, hit up Dexters on a Wednesday. As long as youre okay without bluegill or lake perch there is still a lot to like, especially if you are into the Wild Caught stuff. Overall, we highly recommend Dexters, but of course you already knew that. www.dexterspubmadison.com/301 North StreetMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-3535",2664,0.2246728395061728,0.511837742504409

The bill said sunfish. My belly just said thank you. At this point any review of Dexters is just going to be more of the same so Ill try to keep this brief. This is arguably the best Fish Fry in Madison, and theres no secret about that fact anymore. People love this place, and they love the fish.Bluegill and sunfish are basically one in the same so it really didnt make any difference to me which one it happened to be. As per usual I came for lunch, and as per usual the fish was ready lickety-split. There were seven of the freshwater finsters on the plate and each one was a delicate little work of art. They had the freshwater fish essence, which pairs perfectly with Dexters signature paper-thin breading. They were light and flaky all around, and all seven fillets found the bottom of my belly in about seven minutes. Dexters has a few French fry options, but for my money the waffles are where its at. The portion this time around was gargantuan, which was a bonus since they were fried perfectly and I wanted a lot of them. Of course, they were from a brown freezer bag, but they were well-seasoned on the outside, and fluffy on the inside so who really cares where they originated? Over the years Dexters tartar has morphed from simply serviceable into somewhat sensational. The current incarnation perfectly complements the fish with its creamy texture, and zesty flavor. The slaw has followed a similar trajectory, although it took a little longer to get to where its at. The homemade mix has totally turned the corner, and balances a subtle onion flavor with a light vinegar base. While its not the creamiest youre going to find, it pairs perfectly with the half slice of rye Dexters has recently added to their Friday lineup. This is arguably the best all-around Fish Fry in Madison, and few places can even come close what Dexters is doing. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry, and whether its bluegill, or sunfish, its enough to keep me coming back time and time again. www.dexterspubmadison.com/301 North StreetMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-3535",2112,0.16282945736434112,0.4572978959025471

Back then there was nothing really exciting about Dexters except for some occasional intensity on the volleyball court. In those days Dexters was known as the Sandlot, and was a nice neighborhood spot, but not a destination by any stretch of the imagination. Those days are long gone in 2013, and Dexters Pub has become THE place to be (on Friday nights at least). Dexters has grown, morphed if you will, into the new age Wisconsin tavern with flair. They are slinging high quality suds and more fish than their tiny kitchen was ever meant to handle. This has resulted in long waits on your average Friday night, and even longer waits this Friday when Toppling Goliath Brewery was in attendance as part of the Great Taste of the Midwest festivities. It was more chaotic than normal in the small bar, but since our friends Sean and Sasha were moving west (and wanted go out with a bang) we stuck it out. It was a good 75-90 minutes before our light-up coaster went off (Dexters actually has those now), and we were shown to our table for four. Everything went pretty smoothly from that point on as the wait staff and kitchen were in high gear. The fish took about 15 minutes to arrive, but was nice and hot when it did. My walleye was on the small side (walleye-wise) but was still more than adequate. The sweet fish was flaky and moist, with a mild flavor that let the breading take charge. The breading was light and crispy and really completed the flavor profile thanks to Dexters signature subtle seasoning. It was an excellent preparation and definitely write-up worthy.Usually I opt for the waffle fries when I fish at Dexters, but something in me wanted to branch out this Friday (perhaps it was the effects from four hoppy Toppling Goliath beers?). For whatever reason, the brew fries struck me as appropriate this week, and with their crunchy coating they were. The batter made them feel a little heartier than your average fries, and while the waffles are probably still a better option the brews were very satisfying. A light, but thick, homemade tartar played bow to the fishs cello. It had just the right zip to offset the flavorful fish, and together they played a beautiful tune. It was a harmonious melody that tickled the tongue and prepared the palate for even further enjoyment. Enjoyment in this case came in the form of a half-slice of rye and Dexters homemade slaw. While the slaw isnt necessarily music to the ears its subtle vinegar base and onion-y overtones blend well with the rye, adding a note to the meal that would otherwise be absent. A great beer selection and great food have become the name of the game at Dexters, and everyone just seems to love it. They have become one of the toughest tickets in town on Friday nights, and if you go there will likely be decent wait, but at least there will be plenty to keep your taste buds jumping. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and still think its one of the best Madison has to offer. www.dexterspubmadison.com/301 North StreetMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-3535",3153,0.1909250495267444,0.5561060972925379

There is renewed vigor for the Wisconsin tradition in the Capital City, with places like Dexters Pub leading the charge. These establishments have taken it upon themselves to bring back what originally made the Friday Fish Fry so popular (lightly breaded freshwater fish), while still embracing what modern fish goers expect (crispy beer battered cod). Like a fine wine, Dexters Friday specials have grown more complex and nuanced over time, but somehow managed to keep the traditional aspects alive while evolving to meet the demands of the modern Fish going public.I rolled into Dexters for a quick one since I was due in Door County by 4pm and still had some packing to do. As the doors swung open at 11, I confidently strode through, grabbed at spot at the refurbished bar, and had the first order of the day in. Of course, since I was the one to break the seal, everything was ready in the blink of an eye and served too hot to even handle (just as Id anticipated). As you know, we love the freshwater options at Dexters but today we bucked tradition, instead choosing to be the modern man. Mr. Robotos plate of cod looked like something out of a Fish Fry guide; it was piled high with plump pieces of fish, a big old heap of waffle fries, and all the rest of the usual suspects. The three chunks of fish were nothing if not massive. Each one constituted a whole handful, and although they were beefy, they were still light and flaky. This juxtaposition of size versus density was achieved mostly through Dexters incredibly light beer batter which is every bit as tasty as it is delicate. When the celestial coating is paired with the pristine cod the true essence of the modern Fish Fry comes alive. Complimenting the cod perfectly was a side of Dexters house-made tartar. The whipped delight was thick and zesty, and bumped the cod up yet another notch. A bevy of waffle fries canoodled with the cod, and while they arent as traditional as say, potato pancakes, they are a modern Fish Fry lovers dream. This batch was plentiful and tasty, with a little spice, but nothing overpowering (as the garlic-chili fries often are). Over time Friday Fish has evolved to include a dinner roll instead of the more traditional rye bread. While the bleached starch may be appealing to a wider audience, it is less customary and less healthy for you. Dexters once prescribed to these white bread ways, but recently took it back to the old school. As of this writing Dexters has turned back to the true essence of the Fish Fry, and is now featuring a half-slice of rye that actually pairs pretty well with their vinegar-based onion-y coleslaw. It is truly exciting to see our local Fish Fry establishments representing the best that traditional Fish Fry has to offer while still embracing the modern masses. Overall, we highly recommend the cod at Dexters as well as all their freshwater options. This is a case where you just cant lose regardless of if you take it traditional or have moved to the modern. Dexters does it all. www.dexterspubmadison.com/301 North StreetMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-3535",3181,0.1796744791666667,0.479375

It was going to be a perfect Friday.  A delicious Fish Fry at Dexters, and an opening round victory for the Badgers in The Tournament would make it so. It was all going to be so perfect, then it wasnt.In all fairness, Dexters held up their end of the bargain (and then some). Usually when I come to Dexters on a Friday I try to remain open-minded since they do all the fish varieties so well. Today was a different story. Today I was on a mission. A mission called: Wild Caught Bering Sea Cod. And I was going to get that cod, come hell or high water, I was going to get it. Of course, hell showed up in the form of Dexters new Wild Caught Great Lakes Perch, and the screws started to turn on me. I was torn six ways from Sunday, but stuck to my guns and tried to focus my attention on the opening seconds of the basketball game instead of the scrumptious sounding perch. As the bartender arrived an order for the cod finally passed my lips, and a wave of relief washed over me. I withstood the temptation. The $9.90 3-piece cod came quickly, and appeared to be the first fish of the day to be fried. The three cube-ish cuts of cod were large, and fall-apart flaky. The pristine fish was paired with a flavorful beer batter that looked like it was going to be thick, but was actually incredibly light and a little creamy. It was absolutely superb all around, and has to be some of the best beer battered cod currently available in Madison. When fish is this tasty it really doesnt need much assistance, but Dexters includes a world-class tartar anyway. Their homemade sauce is thick and creamy, and has a nice zest that kicks the fish right in its fish butt. I have been a champion of Dexters waffle fries since I first laid taste bud on them, but today they were a disappointing (much like our beloved Badgers). They were a little less spicy than normal, and although the portion was ample they just didnt blow me away like they have been known to do. Dexters slaw was also not a game changer and although its fresh and homemade, its a little strong on the onion. Its a strange brew thats sorta creamy, and sorta zesty, but just not that great tasting. The plain old white roll was also just so-so, humbly serving its purpose in support of the fantastic fish without seeking much acclaim of its own. The first round loss was certainly a stinger, but at least the Fish Fry I had at Dexters eased the pain somewhat. While the Badgers turned out to be a faulty flock, the cod was practically perfect, and did everything it could to make this the flawless Friday I anticipated. Overall, I highly recommend this Fish Fry and envision a serious problem next time I come to Dexters. Perch, bluegill, walleye, and now cod. A delicious dilemma indeed. www.dexterspubmadison.com/301 North StreetMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-3535",2873,0.22910407647907646,0.532163059163059

Choosing a fish at Dexters is like choosing between children, and no matter how bad I wanted to try the cod I couldnt bring myself to do it  the three freshwater options were simply too tempting. I eventually settled on the $10.30 lake perch since it had been a while since I last perched at Dexters. The seven fillets that arrived were average sized, but ultra-flavorful. The perch was smooth and mild, and breaded with a slightly crispy coating that was a little spicy, but a lot delicious. I knew thered be cod eaters around the table and when thats the case its usually possible to pull a one-for-one. This time I convinced Zach to take the trade, and we were both equally happy he did. The Wild Caught Bearing Sea Cod was simply out of this world. It was light and luxurious with a delicate texture. The Krispy Krème coating of the not-too-distant past has been replaced by a light and decadent encasement, which flaked apart effortlessly and revealed a most superb treasure. The fish was light, flaky, and moist; it was almost perfect, and everything youd want in cod. While I do need a bigger sample size to really say for sure, what I tried was something special, and you can bet the next trip to Dexters Im forcing myself to cast that line.

It was still fairly thick, and while I think it pairs well with the fish, I did overhear others say it wasnt their cup of tea. I guess some folks are even pickier than MFF! Dexters new and improved slaw got the same lukewarm reaction as the tartar which I found a little strange. Some people really liked the crisp and fresh blend, while a couple others though it had a little too much onion and wasnt creamy enough. I just appreciated that it was a step in the right direction, and well leave it at that. The dinner roll was standard, but as fresh and soft as youd like it to be.  By the time all was said and done we were at Dexters for nearly three hours, but Ill be damned if I heard one single person complain about it. Perhaps it was the lively company, or the outstanding beer selection, but whatever it was, by the time we got our food the wait in the bar was a distant memory.

It would be nice if more places had a huge beer selection, but still had your old favorite around. It would be nice if more places made you feel like your business was appreciated, rather than expected. And it would be really nice if more places had an amazing Fish Fry, but also enticing choices for those not in the mood for fish. It would be nice if there were more places like Dexter's, but in reality there just aren't. We had day-after-Thanksgiving guests in town, and they happened to be freshwater fish fans. Since I know Dexters knocks that ball out of the park I decided to fall back on the old mainstay (again). We arrived a little early, had a drink the bar, and eventually found our way to the dining room. As I predicted, it wasnt terribly busy since it was the day after Thanksgiving and we were able to get a table at our leisure (rest assured, this is normally not the case on Friday nights). While I wanted to try the Wild Caught Bering Sea Cod I just couldnt bring myself to do it, especially after noticing the equally untamed sounding Wild Caught Walleye. It was a fishly dilemma to be sure, but one of the most delicious variety. The walleye came in no time and looked just fabulous. The single flaky fillet was large and in charge, and lorded over the frydom with a subtle intimidation. The meat on the monster was moist and tender, and paired perfectly with Dexters seasoned breading. The coating clung to the fish with magnificent force, and stuck to the fingers like cotton candy. The saccharine goodness was sweet and spicy, and necessitated some serious digit-licking just like one needs after gorging on a bag of Nacho Cheese Doritos. If you get the lake perch at Dexters sometimes theyll  drape them over the top of your fries creating a delicious, edible rainbow (if you get the walleye, forget about it - its too damn big to be draping anywhere). Regardless of whether theyre used as a prop or just come on the plate, the spuds will be plentiful and delicious. The waffle versions are simply amazing, and the garlic-chili rendition isnt all that far behind. It is pure potato perfection at Dexters, and you cant really go wrong with any of the options. The roll was just a roll, and Dexters knows this - as long as its there its something. Dexters new slaw on the other hand, was something different all together. It looks like, and I may be saying this prematurely, but it looks like, Dexters has finally figured out the coleslaw conundrum. This rendition was easily the best weve had at Dexters, and was creamy and fresh without any of the overpowering flavors were accustomed to. Finally, Dexters. Finally.If the fourth Thursday of every November is Thanksgiving, then every fourth Friday of November should be something too - a celebration of returning to normalcy, returning home, and returning to the Fish Fry. This year we celebrated at Dexters and as per usual, it was a festive one. Everyone was thrilled with their food (including the vegetarian in the group), and had no problem commenting on that fact. Overall, we highly recommend the walleye at Dexters, and dont be surprised if it shows up in our Top 25. It is just that good. www.dexterspubmadison.com/301 North StreetMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-3535",3337,0.2858872793872794,0.6034814074814074

No, some malady didnt suddenly befall the fish, and no they didnt suddenly decide to ditch the Spotted Cow (which would be a tragedy). No, the major difference on this trip to Dexters was a birthday and what turned out to be a mini birthday party for our Fry brother, Nick.I used to share an office with Nick and we pretty much ate fish every Friday, racking up pert near 100 Frys at Wilsons alone. Those were the good ol days, but as all good things must do, they came to an end. Eventually we moved on and found other fish, which is what brings us to Dexters. Dexters has basically usurped Wilsons spot as our go-to Fish Fry mostly because of the variety of fish offered and their impeccable quality control. In short, Dexters does it all, and when Nick asked me to pick a place for a big crew I offered it up. Good call, MFF. Good call.Stunningly, I pulled into the parking lot at exactly the same time as Nick and his car-load of coworkers. We hustled inside and pulled together a couple of tables in the dining room since it was wide open and another full car-load was on its way. Upon seeing we had taken up shop the bartress (see our last  review) buzzed right over. The rest of the crew arrived shortly after and within moments we all had drinks in front of us and orders of fish on the way. Dexters was on their game as per usual.Bluegill is back on the menu at Dexters which basically left me no choice. Ive had a hunger for it for some time now and when the line was cast, I eagerly took the bait. Dexters has never been one to skimp on the fish and the bluegill fillets were GIGANTIC. They were easily some of biggest (and tastiest) Ive seen (or eaten for that matter). The beefy bluegill were expertly fried, and dusted with Dexters signature light breading. It was classic Dexters and I could go on forever talking about it, but Ill just stop here. It is great stuff, period. Like the fish, the waffles fries were in abundance and perfectly fried. While the regular fries are fine and the garlic-chili fries pack a punch, the waffles are something special which makes branching out a regrettable decision. Of course, a bunch of party-goers did branch out and I didnt hear a single complaint among them, so theres that  Dexters doesnt disappoint. The Fish Fry mastery continued into DPs homemade tartar sauce. It is an excellent mixture, although with so much fish I actually ran out of the thick and zesty blend which was a bit of a bummer. The standard roll was nothing to write home about, but hey, we all get socks for our birthday every now and again, and while they may not be the flashiest gift, they get the job done. The basic bun got the job done too, which is enough for me. While Nick was the one celebrating birthday we all got a present from Dexters in the form of some much improved coleslaw. It was a good blend, and while there was noticeable onion, it wasnt quite as pungent as the pepper blast from the past. It was dramatically better and a candle that just about everyone at the table had no problem blowing out.If the folks at Dexters werent aware of who MFF is before now they most certainly are on to us after this trip. There was a lot of Fish Fry related banter and some genuine inquiries into the popularity of Fish Frys which I was obliged to answer (being the expert). Its no big deal, and Ill just consider it as a little birthday present to our friend Nick to go along with the awesome Fish Fry he enjoyed. Overall, we highly recommend the Fish Fry at Dexters, and will continue to do so. It also sounds like they gained a few new fans, and why not? Nicks birthday lunch turned into a party for us all. Thanks birthday boy!  www.dexterspubmadison.com/301 North StreetMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-3535",3864,0.20193804932441292,0.4090554395099851

Since it was lunch we had our pick of the litter table-wise and grabbed our favorite high-top in the bar. Dexters swift bartender/waitress hybrid whipped by and took our orders lickety-split and the game was afoot.As is the norm at Dexters the fish was ready in about 10 minutes. My $10.29 plate of sunfish looked idyllic and was nice and hot. The waitender (or should I say bartress?), and kitchen were on their game as usual. I tore into the fish and it was nothing less than superb. The sunny little buggers were slightly larger than your average bluegill, but equally delicious. They boasted a light fishiness, which was a little sweet, and very tasty. The flavor melded effortlessly with Dexter's signature so-light-you-can-see-right-through-it breading. Yum. Just yum.Dexters homemade tartar is thick and creamy, and totally kicks the fish up a notch while Dexters signature waffle fries are probably some of the best on this, or any other, planet. Historically the slaw at Dexters has been hit and miss, with far more Ks than singles. This time around they made solid contact and the homemade blend was fresh and sweet. A plain old dinner roll did its part and drove the run that in.Of course, I was pleased with everything on this visit to Dexters and it seemed like everyone else was too. Overall, I highly recommend the sunfish at Dexters and will continue to do so forever and ever (or at least until they stop offering it). Dexters is simply great. Bring your friends, bring your family, and don't think twice about it, theyll love it too. www.dexterspubmadison.com/301 North StreetMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-3535",1977,0.19203639179248932,0.5163259775454897

While it may not be the swankiest place out there, it has a nice vibe, a stellar beer selection, and a focus on fresh, tasty food. Ive been a big fan ever since my first visit back in 2008 and often find myself recommending it to people who want to stay in Madison, but still want variety on a Friday night. It always goes over well.I showed up solo this time  a quick lunch on my mind. The bar was fairly crowded, but I easily found a stool and caught the bartenders eye (The Great Taste of the Midwest was in town and a bunch of sud suckers were bellied up for lunch). She came right over with some menus even though I didnt really need one (I had lake perch on my mind). Regardless, I perused the offerings while she grabbed me a drink and while doing so couldnt help but notice something strange. While Dexters famous bluegill was nowhere to be found a surrogate Sunfish stood in its place. I was oh-so tempted by the alien arrival, but stuck to my guns and picked the perch  biting my lip the whole time. As expected, my $10.29 plate came in 5-7 minutes and was scalding hot all around - theres no B.S. at Dexters. I jumped right into the steam pit and nearly got burned. Each of the seven fillets was lightly breaded, totally grease-free, and simply delicious. They were on the smallish side, but remained tender and moist  just how perch should be. While almost perfect, a little more seasoning in the breading would help, but of course, we are nit-picking. This stuff is simply great.If big portions are your thing Dexters has you covered (in waffle fries). A veritable mountain of the perfectly-fried grids bonded beneath the fish forming the perfect perch for the perch. The spuds were spicy and crispy, what Id call superb. Even though I polished off every last crumb I have to believe most souls wouldnt fare as well as yours truly. In fact, I have seen some of the best Fish Fryers fail to reach the summit. Any great fish should be paired with a great tartar sauce, and Dexters plays matchmaker perfectly. The homemade brew is sweet and zesty, blending with the perch to create a flavor sensation neither could achieve on its own. The Fish Fry at Dexters is the same whether you go for lunch of dinner, and as such you are given a dinner roll. While it is a pretty basic bun Im not one to complain since there are plenty of places that have phased out the staple starch altogether.  For some reason a reasonable slaw continues to elude Dexters and while this rendition was decent, it didnt quite do it for me. While it masquerades as a thin, vinegar-based mix, there is none of that vinegar pop that grabs you by the back of the throat and lets you know whats what. At least it wasnt overloaded with onion this time (as has been Dexters downfall in the past), but it just wasnt as good as everything else.When all was said and done, I was in and out of the North Street nook within 20 minutes - like a thief in the night (although being a good Wisconsinite I did pay my tab in full and gave the lovely barkeep a nice tip to boot). Everything about this visit lived up to the lofty expectations I have placed on Dexters (a side or two of slaw aside). Overall, I highly, highly, highly recommend the lake perch at Dexters and will continue to do so until the give us reason not to and I seriously doubt thats gonna happen any time soon.www.dexterspubmadison.com/301 North StreetMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-3535",3468,0.2826539408866995,0.5626765188834155

To this point weve only looked at Dexters through a lunchtime lens and really havent seen how the eastside eatery handles the dinner crowd. As you know, Friday Night Fish Fry is a far cry from its noon hour counterpart, and just because Dexters dominates lunch doesnt necessarily mean they can maintain their standards when things get gritty after the sun goes down.  What better time for us to see how they handled the pressure than the first Friday of Lent 2012?Jer and I arrived a little early, and as we expected, there was a wait. We put our name on the list, scored a couple stools at the bar and ordered a bucket of Rhinelander shorties. Apparently this beer choice wasnt hip enough for the ultra-cool bartender as we overheard him when he remarked to some other customers that it was, mass produced bullsh*t when they inquired as to what it was. He then went on to recommend a product from New Belgium (which is apparently anything but mass produced BS), and they gleefully gobbled up his suggestion. Whatever, fella we were here for the fish not the approval of some flat cap wearing bartender.As we waited for the rest of the people in our group to show up we sucked down our BS beers and our name was called a couple times, but since everyone wasnt around we just had Nick (the owner) move us down the list. We watched as order after order of fish was fried - most of which was beer battered cod. A lot of walleye, and some perch made it through the oil too, but nowhere near the amount of cod which says something about its popularity. Eventually, the rest of our group showed up, the list was exhausted, and we got our table in the dining room - which was still pretty much full at a quarter-to-eight.The waitress came around in due time and took our orders which we had ample time to deliberate over at the bar. Since the bluegill doesnt swim these waters during the winter I picked the perch, while Garrett chose the cod, and Jer  feeling frisky  went for the grilled lemon-pepper walleye. I have to say I was shocked by Jers choice, but eager to see what they had in store for him.Dexters runs a smooth ship and we had our fish within 15 minutes of ordering even though the kitchen was still buzzing. As per usual the perch was delicious. The plate featured six average-sized fillets that some would describe as limp looking. The flaky little fillets featured Dexters signature pale and flaky breading which houses just enough spice to keep things interesting without overpowering the delicate fish. Jers pan-fried lemon-pepper walleye looked superb as well, but reportedly featured quite a few bones to go along with its velvety texture and succulent spices. While I didnt try it, it wasnt for lack of want, but more the fact that he devoured every last bit with no problem. A huge portion of Dexters brew fries covered the remainder of open real estate on my plate and were superb. While this amount of fries would be overwhelming for most, their crispy deliciousness kept me coming back for more until each and every one of the sublime spuds were gone. Mmm mmm mmm. Dexters tartar hit the fat part of the bullseye, as the thick and creamy sauce gave the perch the boost it needed. The standard dinner roll also hit the target, as did Dexters latest take on coleslaw. This slaw shot had an overarching onion flavor, but was good, clean, and fresh - certainly a gallant effort if nothing else.What can we say? Dexters dominated dinner just like they lord over lunch. The perch was exactly what we have come to expect, the fries were phenomenal, and everything else fell in line. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry, no ifs, ands, or buts about it. Whether its lunch or dinner, Dexters just gets the job done.

As fate would have it MiahMan called in distress and said that he and Cousin Nate were at Dexters and in need of assistance. I sprung into action. Like Clark Kent with a phone booth I changed from average Joe into Superfish in the blink of an eye. I leapt tall thresholds in a single bound on my way out the door and flew down 113 at light speed using my x-ray-like vision to weave in and out of traffic with ease. The force of the Fish Fry drew me in and the 10 minute drive was made in what seemed like mere seconds. In a flash, I was in the door, a plate of perch awaiting my arrival.The $10 perch plate was generously appointed with  7-8 large fillets, an unconscionable amount of brew fries, corpulent cups of tartar and coleslaw, and a dinner roll. Like kryptonite, the perch brought our trio to its knees with its flavor and bounty. The fish was delish. Each and every piece was moist and flaky with a breading to die for. The bevy was too much for MiahMan and Cousin Nate, but heroically Superfish was there to save the day, taking out his adversaries with ease.Dexters brew fries are not one to be messed with and today they came in waves. The platoon of potatoes took the low ground, and provided a solid foundation for the perch to brace itself against. They were entrenched, but we mustered up all our courage (and hunger) and busted the crispy critters out of their salty bunker. The garlic/chile rendition MiahMan and Cousin Nate took on also came in large numbers. They were a force to be reckoned with as the slightly-spicy squad kept our heroes at bay until the end when Superfish intervened and thinned their herd. Coming to our aide was Dexters homemade tartar sauce which was a powerful mix with a mayo:relish proportion that was tough to tame. The zesty sauce perked up the perch and made its ultimate demise inevitable. Testing our conviction was the standard tear-off style dinner roll, which neither helped nor hurt matters, and Dexters latest peril-fraught endeavor into the realm of the slaw. Try as we might the strangely unappealing slaw took the wind out of our sails causing us to turn away in horror. Luckily, the cabbage-y catastrophe was a minor setback and the phenomenal force of the Fish Fry won the day.As quickly as we arrived we were gone, vanishing into the wondrous Madison skyline -our bellies full, and our foes bested.  Somewhere lost would-be fish goers cry out, where, oh where do we find the best Fish Fry!? For these souls, there is Madison Fish Fry - a lover of The Fry, a seeker of fishly knowledge, a champion of the people, by the people and for the people. Madison Fish Fry gives them hope that, should they seek, they will find. He gives them a name, an answer to their most lingering questions, a place to fulfill their deepest fried desires.

Wilsons? Rudes Lanes? The Villa Tap? Somewhere else? All sounded plausible, but didnt seem to fit the bill. I struggled with the options, some nudging me north, others pulling to the east, and still more wheedling me west. With the convolution it was nearly impossible to decide, so I just headed out, hoping fate would intervene. As I drove south along 113 the murky haze began to lift as an almost unnatural force willed me towards something. Eventually this something came into focus, it was Dexters Pub, and I knew fate was smiling on me.Yes, Dexters was the epiphany I was looking for. It met all my criteria: open by 11, lots of great options beyond cod, and quick service to get me on my way. I landed on North Street at 5-to and waited for the doors to open. At 11 oclock on-the-dot the entrance flung wide and I scampered inside. Of course, since I was first in, I was first fried and my bluegill was ready in no time flat.  The bluegill has been getting steady bumps in price and now rests at $10.29, which is still a fair value in our book. On this day my eight small fillets were slightly under-fried and a little on the limp side, but that didnt bother me since I like em like that way once in a while. They housed a wafer-thin, nearly-transparent breading which was well-seasoned and delicious. The fish paired perfectly with Dexters homemade tartar which was rich, creamy, and zesty  exactly what you want.Practically pushing the fish off the plate was a mound of waffles fries which were produced from a big brown freezer bag. They were cooked to a perfect crispness and heavily spiced once removed from the oil and shook clean. They were delicious, and the sheer numbers added some serious beef to the meal.Finalizing the foray was a regular roll, some room temperature butter and Dexters latest rendition of homemade coleslaw. While the roll was what we expected it to be, the slaw was again hit-and-miss. This go-round was not as good as our previous sampling as the thin, vinegar-based blend, missed the mark. It had a very pungent cabbage flavor, and while it was vinegar-based, it lacked enough of the acidic liquid to crush the cabbage tang.Try as we might, we are instinctively drawn to Dexters and powerless to resist its charms. Their fish is simply superb, and you really cant go wrong with any of the options. We would love to change it up every now and again but the bluegill has us hooked. Whats more, the generously portioned fries make the meal feel more substantial and the tremendous tartar, average roll, and pedestrian slaw all do what they need to do. Overall, this is still, and will always be, a highly recommendable Fish Fry and one that will keep us coming back time and again. www.dexterspubmadison.com/301 North StreetMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-3535",2986,0.20504629629629625,0.536270180436847

Ocean fish, lake fish, Dexters can really make fish. Ten dollar perch, a cup of clam chowder. A lunch fit for a king, thats a no-doubter. Homemade soup before fish, the way it should be. A few large pieces of clam, still, mores nice to see. Or just chop it finer, and disperse it throughout. Good soup regardless, but not what Fish Frys all about.Fish is the focus, and Dexters knows that. Perch, bluegill, and walleye are all where its at. Seven perch fillets, not huge, but not small. Light, flaky, and moist, they did not appall. A light breading, their highlight, let the fish in the door. Just slightly under-spiced, it still won the war. Not a drop of grease to be seen, even once all was gone. Dexters, dear Dexters, over your fish we do fawn. A load of waffle fries, took over the plate. Pushing the fish to the side, we simply couldnt wait. In classic abundance, these fries stole the show. Already perfectly spicy, salt we did forgo. Right on the money, tartar sauce perked the perch.

The waitress buzzed right over, dropped some menus, and scampered away to grab us some drinks while giving Reese a chance to peruse his options. I was already locked into the $10 bluegill so the only decision for me was between brew fries, waffle fries, or pub chips, of which I branched out and tried the homemade chips. When she came round again, fish orders were placed, drinks were sipped, and merriment exchanged. The food arrived posthaste, and I pounced on my platter like a jungle cat. Several of the bluegill met their makers instantly as I sunk my claws deep into them, devouring their flaky torsos in the blink of an eye. The rest of the school met a similar fate, as the airy fish was simply impossible to resist. The light breading was home to the perfect blend of spices, and complimented the flaky fish flawlessly. Also flattering the fish was Dexters outstanding tartar sauce which was thick and zesty, and paired perfectly with the bluegill. At the end of the day the tiny cup was just enough thanks to the fact that the fish was so good the sauce could be used sparingly. From our previous experiences we know that Dexters waffle fries are a cut above the rest. It just so happens the homemade pub chips were also nothing to scoff at. The thin-cut chips were nice and hot when served, and tasted divine with the generous dousing of salt I laid on them. All in all they were very good, but the one detractor, if there is one, is that they got cold quickly; so for you slower eaters, you might need to make an adjustment or be satisfied with cold chips. Not a big loss in my book, but definitely something to think about when deciding on your side.Rounding out the plate was a nice, soft white roll, and Dexters latest take coleslaw. The roll was what we have come to expect, but ever-changing slaw was a bit of a surprise. This has to be the best slaw weve had at Dexters to date - although it still wasnt perfect. The previous versions included vast amount of green pepper, but this latest incarnation seems to have supplanted onion for the verde veggie, making for an extremely potent mixture. While this rendition was a dramatically different there is still some room for improvement.As I polished off my remaining morsels, Reese offered a bite of his bountiful walleye fillet, which I simply couldnt refuse. The wonderful walleye was every bit as good as the bluegill and home to the same spicy breading. Reese also sprung for the homemade Hungarian mushroom soup which came before the fish, and he claimed to be excellent. Apparently all of Dexters soups are homemade, so make sure to check them out if you are a soup eater.Overall, this was another fantastic visit to an icon on the Madison Fish Fry scene. Both styles of fish were above reproach and blended effortlessly with Dexters signature tartar sauce. The pub chips were also great, and fit right in with the rest of the fantastic potato options. After sampling all the varieties we have come to the conclusion that you really cant go wrong with the spuds at Dexters so just get whichever one happens to sound best to you. The banquet is capped off with a standard dinner roll, and Dexters continually improving slaw, making for a truly idyllic Fish Fry experience. If you live in the Madison area, and are a fan of Fish Fry you simply have to make the trek to Dexters. We promise, you wont be disappointed.www.dexterspubmadison.com/301 North StreetMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-3535",4217,0.23444850288600294,0.5286518959435625

I was already locked into the $10 bluegill so the only decision for me was between brew fries, waffle fries, or pub chips, of which I branched out and tried the homemade chips. When she came round again, fish orders were placed, drinks were sipped, and merriment exchanged. The food arrived posthaste, and I pounced on my platter like a jungle cat. Several of the bluegill met their makers instantly as I sunk my claws deep into them, devouring their flaky torsos in the blink of an eye. The rest of the school met a similar fate, as the airy fish was simply impossible to resist. The light breading was home to the perfect blend of spices, and complimented the flaky fish flawlessly. Also flattering the fish was Dexters outstanding tartar sauce which was thick and zesty, and paired perfectly with the bluegill. At the end of the day the tiny cup was just enough thanks to the fact that the fish was so good the sauce could be used sparingly. From our previous experiences we know that Dexters waffle fries are a cut above the rest. It just so happens the homemade pub chips were also nothing to scoff at. The thin-cut chips were nice and hot when served, and tasted divine with the generous dousing of salt I laid on them. All in all they were very good, but the one detractor, if there is one, is that they got cold quickly; so for you slower eaters, you might need to make an adjustment or be satisfied with cold chips. Not a big loss in my book, but definitely something to think about when deciding on your side.Rounding out the plate was a nice, soft white roll, and Dexters latest take coleslaw. The roll was what we have come to expect, but ever-changing slaw was a bit of a surprise. This has to be the best slaw weve had at Dexters to date - although it still wasnt perfect. The previous versions included vast amount of green pepper, but this latest incarnation seems to have supplanted onion for the verde veggie, making for an extremely potent mixture. While this rendition was a dramatically different there is still some room for improvement.As I polished off my remaining morsels, Reese offered a bite of his bountiful walleye fillet, which I simply couldnt refuse. The wonderful walleye was every bit as good as the bluegill and home to the same spicy breading. Reese also sprung for the homemade Hungarian mushroom soup which came before the fish, and he claimed to be excellent. Apparently all of Dexters soups are homemade, so make sure to check them out if you are a soup eater.Overall, this was another fantastic visit to an icon on the Madison Fish Fry scene. Both styles of fish were above reproach and blended effortlessly with Dexters signature tartar sauce. The pub chips were also great, and fit right in with the rest of the fantastic potato options. After sampling all the varieties we have come to the conclusion that you really cant go wrong with the spuds at Dexters so just get whichever one happens to sound best to you. The banquet is capped off with a standard dinner roll, and Dexters continually improving slaw, making for a truly idyllic Fish Fry experience. If you live in the Madison area, and are a fan of Fish Fry you simply have to make the trek to Dexters. We promise, you wont be disappointed.www.dexterspubmadison.com/301 North StreetMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-3535",4217,0.23444850288600294,0.5286518959435625

Dexters and Fish Fry have been together since the two met nearly three years ago when Dexters took over their current location on the corner of North and Johnson. During this time their love has blossomed into one of the most beautiful relationships in the Madison area, and it is truly a union that benefits all comers. Dexters has worked diligently to make four quality Fish Fry options a reality, and today, we celebrate their partnership with much rejoicing and plenty of overeating.  There are many reasons to be excited for this marriage: most notably are the breathtaking bluegill, the lovable lake perch, the wonderful walleye, and the creamy cod that Dexters has invested their time and energy in mastering. Today we make special note of the bluegill which has graced our palate lo these many occasions, and been breathtaking each and every time.For a mere $9.25, Dexters has given us the opportunity to partake in their incredibly lightly breaded bluegill and enjoy its succulence; we are blessed that the pair has allowed us to share in this beautiful relationship. Although the fish could have been fried slightly longer today, it was still very good, and is truly a defining taste on the Madison Fish Fry scene. While on occasion a slight bit of grease will accumulate, the deliciousness of the flaky breading and tender fish always pulls through these tough times.Strong traits abound in the love Dexters exudes for Fish Fry; it is evidenced everywhere, especially in the fantastic French fry varieties. We see Dexters dedication for filling bellies by the generous allotment of spicy waffle fries they provide. Their perfect blend of crispiness and spiciness display Dexters devotion, and speak highly of their desire to move their relationship with Fish Fry forward. It is also clear that Dexters takes the needs of their fish seriously, and assists it in all ways possible. The tartar provided shows its dedication by blending a solid mayo base with a generous proportion of relish. While a wimpier fish may not be able to handle such strong support, Dexters bluegill enjoys the potent sauce, which in the end detracts nothing, and makes both stronger in the process. Dexters, we know you take Fish Fry seriously as you have generously done what is necessary to complete the true Fish Fry experience. You have graced us with the full complement, including bread, which some people consider an afterthought in this day and age. We all appreciate you dedication to the tradition and the institution of the Fry and look upon your generosity with fondness, even if your offering of a plain white dinner roll is nothing out of the ordinary.  All relationships have their ups and downs, and we applaud Dexters strong efforts in transforming their once strange slaw to a concoction bordering on acceptance. While even this new mayo laden brew has not yet touched transcendence, we can see the time and care invested, and will take your word that sour cream-ish slaw was simply mixed improperly today. On our subsequent visits we expect you will have fully worked out the kinks, and we plan to enjoy you efforts with this fine finishing touch. Overall, we approve this union as all the Madison area benefits from it magnificence. Dexters has embraced the Fry, and all the components that come along with it: the eight enchanting bluegill fillets, the plentiful portion of waffle fries, the tactful use of tartar, the courageous attempt at coleslaw, and the inclusion of some sort of bread. All that remains is to make it official Dexters, do you take Fish Fry, To have, but not overfry,For better or worse attempts at coleslaw,For richer cod we have never seen, In sickness, but hopefully not food poisoning,To love, and cherish the tradition,As long as you have the ability to fry?You do? Yeah, we already knew you did. We hereby pronounce Dexters as one of Madisons finest Fish Frys. You may now kiss the bride or just make me some more of that bluegill.www.dexterspubmadison.com/301 North StreetMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-3535",4203,0.2463280194232575,0.5631447124304267

When Friday rolls around we at Madison Fish Fry are powerless to resist the enticement and must get our fill. Our pusher is Dexters Pub - a veritable czar of the Fish Fry. Wed visited Dexters a couple weeks ago, but once Jer got a taste of that sweet, sweet bluegill, he was hooked. Even though we had just taken our share of their intoxicants in, I propositioned him and by asking if he was ready for a return visit - he was. We went to get our fix.  We showed up at the East Side mainstay right around noon and grabbed one of the open high-top tables in the bar room. No sooner had we sat down than the waitress swung by with some menus and drink inquiries. Since we were here to sample their special fare we pushed the menus aside and simply told her that Fish Fry was our muse. She scooped the menus back up and queried us as to which of the delicious options we were most interested in. Jers drug of choice was the bluegill, while I was looking for a different buzz, and went for the lake perch. The fish was ready soon after, and our trip began. As always, Dexters hooked us up right, no short sacks here. Both the bluegill and perch were lightly breaded and simply delicious. Like true Fish Fry junkies we hovered over our plates, not wanting anyone to see that which we were engrossed in. I quickly put down four of the eight perch fillets and felt the warming glow emanate from my gut and envelop my entire body. Ecstasy was attained. The fish itself was as addicting as the breading, and the flaky morsels were soon expended leaving us drunk on their memory. Junkie Jer also let me pinch a little out of his stash, and I must say, while my perch was excellent, his bluegill was truly a buzz to remember. If you go to Dexter's, go for the 'gill.If you deem the fish is as addicting as any morphine you are going to find, consider the waffle fries crack cocaine.

Very rarely do people brag about their addictions, and when it comes to bread and slaw, Dexter's isn't one to boast, but then again, they don't need to. The roll offered was a little blah this go-round, although certainly not bad in any way. The homemade slaw also isn't my bag, but a green pepper guru might think it's a high that can't be beat. Overall, Dexter's is peddling a Fish Fry addicts dream. The lightly breaded, flaky fish, is truly a special thing, and always served lickety-split. The tantalizing tartar and fantastic fries only serve to further the obsession, and when coupled with the extremely quick turnaround, keep the addicts coming back for more.

We love Fish Fry, but no matter what spin you try to put on it, it is just that  a Fish Fry. Nothing more than a single meal that helps to cap off a week at work, and put you in the mood for the upcoming weekend. Writing a review of an event like this can be a bit of a bizarre undertaking and here at Madison Fish Fry we put a fair amount of time and effort into making our reviews not only factual, but fun to read. Sure, this might mean we cant pump out reviews immediately for the fish we ate last Friday, but that is just how it goes sometimes. Besides, as Jer put it: I think most people look at the website on Friday for the meal they want to go to this week; very few, if any, are following along week-by-week to catch the latest news. Google Analytics seems to support his argument. Maybe some of you do tune in to get the freshest Fish Fry fodder (and we love you for it), but by-and-large, the info will be there for you when it is needed, and that is what is most important to us (and hopefully to you). It was only a couple weeks ago that we decided to make a return visit to Dexters Pub, and why not? The place has a crackerjack Fish Fry. The boys and I pulled into the lot at noon and my jaw nearly hit the floorboard of the car when I saw how empty it was. Sweet! I thought. Well be in and out in no time flat. We rolled inside, grabbed a table, and made the eye-contact necessary to announce our arrival to the waitress. She swung by posthaste and took our orders  two orders of bluegill and one of cod (and one High Life for me as I felt the need to support our vets).I didnt get halfway through my Champaign before our platters were prepared. She dropped the grub before us and we tore into it like a pack of wild dogs on a T-bone steak. The six large bluegill fillets were simply off the chart. They were lightly battered and extremely flaky all around. They tasted simply phenomenal and paired perfectly with the mayo-rich tartar. They were so good I almost ate them too fast and had to slow myself down in order to take in their full majesty. I also pulled a chunk of the cod off Gabes plate (with his permission, of course) and it enjoyed its succulence. It was much better than I remember it being as it was extremely rich tasting and was matched by its equally creamy batter. Gabe likened this batter to a pastry, and coined it The Krispy Kreme of Cod. That Gabe is one funny bugger. Also piled on the platter were the waffle fries I chose over the regular fries (or Gabes cottage cheese). The cross-cut potatoes were spot on as the exteriors were nice and spicy with a crispy coating, while the middles were perfectly soft and fluffy. As I have come to expect, the homemade coleslaw at Dexters was not great, but at least you can sense that it is freshly prepared. It is punctuated by a pretty raw taste, but really lacking in overall flavor. That being said, I did eat quite a bit more than usual as they seem to have eased up on the green pepper a little bit. Like the mildly improved slaw the dinner roll on the side has also taken a turn for the better. It was fresh and soft, and just flat-out good.Overall, this Fish Fry is very, very recommendable, and we are sorry we couldnt get around to telling you about it sooner. If we could somehow pump out our Fish Fry reviews as fast as Dexters pumps out their actual Fish Fry we would probably be better off, but unfortunately we just dont have the extra time this summer to sit down and write our reviews ASAP (MFF and soon-to-be wife are planning their own wedding from the ground up which consumes much of our free time). Rest assured that if we had not already been on Dexters bandwagon we would have been chomping at the bit to tell you about the breathtaking bluegill, the wonderful waffle fries and the tremendous tartar. As it stands, you already knew all that stuff so it wasnt such a big deal.

http://madisonfishfry.com/reviews.php?restaurant=169,http://madisonfishfry.com/reviews.php?restaurant=169&event=454,2010-01-29,Dexter's Pub,"Overall, I would highly recommend this Fish Fry.",Excellent,Good,Excellent,Good,Good,"As our good friend Dorothy pointed out There is no place like home. Home just feels right. It is a comfortable place where one can unwind and be themselves. Forgetting the worries of the day and being at peace with the world are the luxuries being at home affords. The same can be said for your home away from home. This is a place with similar qualities, comforting, relaxing and welcoming. After yet another successful Fish Fry, Dexters Pub on Madisons east side is quickly becoming our home away from home. When Gabe suggested I meet him and some of his coworkers for lunch at Dexters I was a little hesitant since I had just been there a couple weeks back and was looking forward to trying somewhere new. After a quick internal discussion I realized that I had never tried the walleye and Dexters so even if the place wasnt new, the style of fish style would be. He called to let me know they were on their way shortly after 12:00 and when I arrived around 12:30 they already had a table and some drinks. The waitress came over as soon as she saw that I had joined the group and took our orders; we had two perch eaters, one cod, one catfish po boy and my walleye. She zipped to the kitchen area with the orders, dropped them, and zipped back with a couple bottles of Spotted Cow. I sat back, sipped my delicious brewski, and watched some X-Games while BSing with the SoFo crew for a little bit. Less then ten minutes later the fish was ready.  Often times walleye is served as one massive piece, which is fine, but makes it impossible to eat with your hands which I prefer. Dexters breaks their fillets into two smaller pieces which makes them much more conducive to handling. My two pieces were served fresh from the fryer and were steaming hot. They enjoyed a light breading and were well fried even though some parts were very meaty while others were thinner and crispier. By and large the walleye tasted great and was a good deal at $10.75.My last trip to Dexters I thought I had missed out since I didnt try the brew fries. I seemed to recall there were three options: regular, brew and waffle but it turns out that the brew fries are the regular fries, so I did try them after all. I opted for them again this time and they were equally tasty but the enormous stack was lukewarm when served, and cold by the end. The tartar at Dexters is right on the money each and every time, and the generous portion actually stood up to the hearty chunks of walleye. Only at the end was I able to fully polish it off with a few remaining fries. The creamy tartar is clearly homemade as is their coleslaw. It is very unique and unusually heavy on the green pepper. Although this round seemed to be less peppery and a little zestier than it has been, it was a noticeable improvement over my previous visits. To complete the circle, Dexters threw in a standard looking roll which was soft and fresh, exactly what I expect to round out my meal.I think it is safe to say that Dexters has freshwater fish on lockdown. The bluegill, lake perch and walleye are all fantastic. I have had all of them now and highly recommend you try each and every one. As far as which is best, it is like choosing between children. They are all good options for what they are. If you are a perch fan, you will like this perch. If bluegill suits your fancy, then you will enjoy their bluegill. Now that I have had the walleye I can also say if you love the big guys, Dexters has you covered. Heck, Dexters even has pretty good beer battered cod, but in my opinion it cant hold a candle to its freshwater brethren. Overall, I recommend you try Dexters. The fish is great and the service has always been fast and friendly. That being said I have never attempted to eat dinner there and imagine it could be quite a different animal since Dexters is, in actuality, a bar first and an eatery second. As it stands I have found Dexters to be a great spot for a lunch time Fish Fry and will be back time and again until I have reason not to. Dexters, welcome home. www.dexterspubmadison.com/301 North StreetMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-3535",4130,0.18275230793303082,0.4644932176257478

Not everyone enjoys a good Fish Fry as much as yours truly, and more over, some people dont like it at all. Hard to believe I know, but it is true. Furthermore, most everyone prefers to get their fish for dinner instead of lunch. Since I take pretty much any and every opportunity to get fish this often leaves me companionless on my lunch hour excursions. This Friday was just such an occasion so I decided to take my one man wolf pack to Dexters Pub as they have a great Fish Fry and a friendly atmosphere whether you have a party ten or are flying solo, like I was.I arrived at Dexters and sat at the bar as I often do when unaccompanied. Usually when you sit right at the bar the bartenders and wait staff cant help but keep an eye on you which results in good service and hot fish. True to form, the bartender was there in a flash and took my drink order while passing me a Friday menu. I quickly decided on the $9.25 lake perch with a side of regular fries over the equally enticing (and priced) bluegill or the walleye for $10.25. I had a clear view of the kitchen and could see the whole process in action. It only took the cook about 10 minutes before he had my order ready and waiting for the spunky waitress to pick up. It was still nice and hot even though she cashed out a couple other patrons before running over to get it for me. The seven perch fillets were covered with a light breading as advertised. The breading itself did not have a ton of flavor but since it was so light it really allowed the taste of the perch to come through, which I really like. Dont get me wrong, this batter is well above average but a little pick me up could make it otherworldly. The fish itself was very good and remained light and flaky throughout the entire meal (not that it was around for long mind you)I was going to try the brew fries because I have had good luck with them at other places, but for some reason I totally spaced on when I ordered. Thankfully the regular fries were excellent and arrived in huge numbers. They were perfectly fried and had a nice coating of somethingerother that gave them a kick. Likewise, the tartar was damn near perfect and served in the classic supper club tin cup. It was plentiful and even seven fillets and a massive amount of fries were not enough to kill it. When I get quality fish, fries and tartar I count my blessings and chalk it up as a win. At this point it really doesnt matter that much to me how great the coleslaw or bread is, just that they are there. Dexters subscribes to a similar philosophy and allots you an average white roll and some slaw which is insanely heavy on the green pepper. I tend to like a creamier and/or zestier slaw, and while this stuff clearly homemade it is not really my cup of tea.I am more than pleased I decided to take my one man show to Dexters. Especially when you are solo, but even when you are not, they serve up a mean plate of fish in no time flat. When all was said and done I was in and out in just over 30 minutes. As for the food, the perch, fries and tartar were all great while the bread and slaw did their part. The service was great and as far as bars go the atmosphere isnt all that bad. Overall, I have no qualms about highly recommending this Fish Fry and will be back soon consume some more of our fresh water friends.www.dexterspubmadison.com/301 North StreetMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-3535",3438,0.21941086691086695,0.5254965013618859

I had been worried earlier in the day that such an opportunity may not present itself, but when met with it I quickly leapt to my feet and was out the door. I hit the gas and sped towards Dexters Pub arriving at the east side establishment within a matter of minutes. I hurled myself in the door and to the nearest barstool. The waitress/bartender arrived shortly thereafter, grabbed me a beer and asked if I would like to see a menu. For me there was no need for a menu since the plethora of Fish Fry options was clearly listed on the chalkboards above the coolers. The options include: beer battered cod, bluegill, walleye and lake perch amongst others. I have tried the cod and the lake perch in the past and since I really want to try them all at some point it helped narrow my choice to walleye or bluegill. I chose the bluegill with regular fries for $9.25 and took a moment to settle down; the moment would not last long. As quickly as I came to Dexters the Fish Fry came to me. It was ready in about seven minutes and was served scalding hot. The nine bluegill fillets were lightly battered and simply delicious. They were a perfect golden color and firm but not crisp in any way. I could easily pick them up and dip them in the fantastic tartar sauce without them falling all over themselves or breaking apart. Between the fish and the tartar near perfection was achieved.Each of my pervious visits I chose waffle fries as my side and was very pleased, but this time I decided to go with the regular option which were far from ordinary. They seemed to have some special seasoning which was very good and made them brilliant golden-red color. They were perfectly fried and like the fish were improved by the tasty tartar. I devoured my plateful within a matter of minutes rarely stopping for a drink of the Cow.As quickly as the food had come it was gone. All that remained was a tiny chunk of my somewhat stale roll and a half cup of the green pepper laden coleslaw. The waitress came quickly thereafter and dropped of my bill which she collected pretty much on the spot leaving me to breeze out the door. In total I was in Dexters no longer than 25 minutes and gone no longer than 40 minutes total. Thanks in part to the quick turnaround at Dexters we were easily out of the house by 1pm and made our appointment in Eau Claire with plenty of time to spare. I have to say it is pretty sweet that they can kick out such an awesome Fish Fry so quickly. The food was delicious and the service was incredibly fast and friendly. Sure, the bar atmosphere may leave something to be desired but if you love Fish Fry you come to expect it. If you are a  Fish Fry fanatic Dexters is one that shouldn't be overlooked.www.dexterspubmadison.com/301 North StreetMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-3535",3038,0.2094431846812799,0.5751278175087698

Yes, you heard right, there are some people out there who believe the city we know and love is Wisconsin’s dirtiest secret, especially when it comes to Fish Fry. We at Madison Fish Fry could not disagree more and have found so many great places to get the Friday special we have had trouble keeping them all straight. We also don’t discriminate based on what is truly “classic” or “traditional”. We love our lake perch, bluegill and walleye, but if the special is cod or ocean perch and it tastes good why dislike it just because it isn’t what your grandma would have made? Times change, tastes evolve, and Fish Fry is not 100% immune. Plus, when you get right down to it there are still plenty of places in Madison that offer fantastic freshwater fish, not the least among them being Dexter’s Pub on the corner of North Street and East Johnson. I had been to Dexter’s once before and been mildly impressed. While the cod I had didn’t bowl me over the sheer variety of fish on the menu filled me with anticipation for another visit. This time I arrived right on the lunch hour, grabbed myself one of the open seats at the bar and took a glance at the board. Dexter’s lists a huge variety of fish options and has no problem pointing out that their freshwater fish is “lightly breaded” which I love to see. Since I came with perch or bluegill (both $9.25) on my mind I asked the bartender which was better as he grabbed me a drink. Six of one, half dozen of the other, was his response which made me smile a little as I settled on a plate of perch with waffle fries.The food came 10-15 minutes after my order went in and was served on a somewhat fancy (I would say non-traditional) square plate. The seven perch filets were very hot and as lightly breaded as advertised. They tasted good although the batter could have used slightly more spice I think. The well blended tartar helped to make up for it though and made for a great taste combination. The fish itself was light, flaky and well fried. While it wasn’t perfect it was still superb and I had no trouble putting away all seven pieces.On my last visit the highlight of the meal were the waffle fries. This time they were still good but not as great as I remembered. They seemed thinner and a little overcooked but, were still actually good and I certainly had no trouble eating every last one of them. I also ate the whole plain white roll that came along for the ride even if it was a little stale. The coleslaw on the other hand I couldn’t finish. It was clearly homemade but had way too much green pepper in it for my taste. Although I will say the semi-arid slaw did grow on me slightly be the time my fish was gone as I ate almost half of the cup.After a second visit to Dexter’s I can easily recommend this Fish Fry. The lightly breaded lake perch was delicious and I assume the walleye and bluegill would follow suit. All the elements of this Fish Fry work as they should. The fish is the centerpiece, surrounded by the fries and tartar in supporting rolls. The bread and slaw are the extras and do their part without overshadowing the stars of the show. Dexter’s puts on a great production and we will be back for an encore presentation soon. All in all, after yet another great Fish Fry at a local spot I am left to wonder, how can anyone really think that Madison sucks?

The first day of spring. A winter snowstorm. March Madness. Friday Fish Fry. All these events just so happen to coincide today. It is only fitting that on great day such as this, a great fish fry should be eaten. Since the weather was terrible we decided to try a local place for lunch because we didn’t want to drive too far. I read some good things about Dexter’s Pub and had always wanted to see what it was like so I figured today would be the perfect opportunity to give them a shot. The Friday Fish Fry at Dexter’s was actually better than I thought it would be when we first walked in. There are three fish choices: Beer Battered Cod, Bluegill and Walleye (prepared two different ways). There is also a catfish po’ boy which looked pretty tasty, but doesn’t really count as a fish fry in my book. It was a hard choice but I broke down and went with the standard Cod. The fish was served piping hot and tasted good, but not outstanding. It was somewhat flaky but didn’t have a very firm texture which made it feel slightly ‘smushy’. The beer batter itself was actually pretty good, some of the better I can remember, but I am not a huge fan of beer batter so I don’t usually opt for it. Next time I would definitely try one of the other options but the cod is good enough that I would get it again as well at some point.Perhaps the highlight of he meal were the spicy waffle fries which were delicious, and generously portioned. There was a regular option but I was very pleased with my choice. The tartar sauce was great, but I would certainly have liked a larger cup for the three good sized pieces of fish. The coleslaw was very coleslaw-y and the bread was there but kind of crusty.There is no doubt Dexter’s is the neighborhood bar, but that is no reason they can’t serve up a classic fish fry. I’m not sure that Dexter’s would be my first choice if I was recommending places to go, but for only $6.50 you can’t ask for much more. The fish was good, and the other options sounded great as well. The atmosphere may leave a little to be desired but they did have some TV’s which allowed us to watch the tournament while enjoying some good fish. The service wasn’t great, but hey, it’s a bar. Dexter’s also had a very full menu of daily items that looked very good, and I am actually looking forward to going back some day when it’s not Friday to give some of their sandwiches a try. Dexter’s definitely gives you ‘bang for your buck’ and serves up a quality Friday Fish Fry.www.dexterspubmadison.com/301 North StreetMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-3535",2574,0.26086608717561094,0.5617639591449117

Someone says, Hey, this place has great fish, you gotta try it only to find out its not all its cracked up to be. These ploys have lured us in before resulting in a many-a wasted Friday, and some hurt feelings along the way. Wed heard similar honkings of fantastic fish at the Decoy Bar & Grill in Edgerton, and knew the potential consequences, but decided to roll the dice anyway (thats what we do after all). Luckily for us, sometimes the flock is right, and delicious fish is our reward.The Decoy is kind of an odd place, and when we pulled into their lot around 7pm we werent sure what to think. From the outside it resembles a Country Kitchen or some other nondescript family restaurant. Oh great, I thought, were gonna get burned on this one. Once we got inside and saw that they were busy some relief came over us, but still not enough to put our minds at ease. The Decoy is not your typical bar/restaurant in fact wed say it is more of a restaurant/bar (that is more restaurant than bar). It is well lit, featuring dining tables instead of pool tables, and daily special boards in lieu of dart boards. We grabbed a spot on the jut of the huge bar and ordered some drinks from the bartender when she came by. Since we were already bellied-up we passed up the opportunity to grab a table and just ordered our fish from a waitress after the first girl left our drinks and never came back.On Fridays the Decoy offers two sizes of fish: $11 for a 5-piece cod, or $9 for a 3-piece. The service wasnt exactly crackerjack and it took about 20 minutes for our food to find us, but it was still hot when it did. I dug into piece one of five instantly and was very pleased with the preliminary results. The cod was simply delicious, and grew on me until I was actually a little sad when the last piece was gone. It was rich and tasted like it was baked first then fried as a distinct buttery flavor came through at the end. It was sheathed in a delicious breading which was Wilsons-esque, but even a bit better. The flavorful coating clung to the stark white cod very well and brought a welcome contrast creamy fish. While the variety of fish may be lacking, three different potato choices picked up some of the slack. Of course, we skipped the baked, but some thick-cut crinkles and Boston baked with cheese found their way to our plates. I didnt get my paws on the Boston baked, but reports were that the crinkles were superior anyway. My generous pile of crinkle-cuts were well fried but remained a little on the limp side which I actually dont mind, especially since they were well-seasoned. The fish was good enough to stand on its own two fins, but was further enhanced by the Decoys homemade cup of tasty tartar. The splendid sauce was thick and creamy, with the perfect amount of zest. Its tastiness was mirrored by the competent coleslaw which came in the next-size-up solo cup. The thick was abundant as the creamy goo practically toppled over the rim. It sported a smooth zip without a hint of raw cabbage flavor.We have become more than accustomed to the standard pre-packaged-tear-off style dinner roll, but apparently the norm is just not good enough for the Decoy. They upped the ante and doled out a real roll, complete with room temperature pat of butter. Its spongy innards were fully enclosed by a delightfully crispy crust which was a welcome change of pace from the old standby.Looks can be deceiving. Sometimes a place looks the part only to pull the wool over your eyes when you actually sample their Friday fare. Conversely, another place might come across as Dennys for drunks and totally blow you away with superbly fried fish. Thankfully, this Edgerton exclusive falls into the latter category. Overall, we highly recommend the Fish Fry at The Decoy and will make it a point to visit them again before too long. I know weve said that before, but this time we mean it.

It is down there near Edgerton or Fort Atkinson or one of those I think it might be on a lake or something Im pretty sure its like a dudes name um, I cant quite remember what it is exactly, but dude you gotta try it, it is sooooo goodI have heard stories like these for years. People would talk about a great Fish Fry somewhere southeast of Madison, but no one ever came forward with firsthand proof of its existence. It got to the point where it was like an urban (or in this case rural) legend. Recently we became aware Norms Hideaway on Lake Koshkonong was the likely source of many of these rumors. Armed with this knowledge we found the first available Friday took the roughly 30 minute trip towards rural Fort Atkinson.We arrived at Norms right around 7pm and grabbed a spot on the side of the road since the parking lot was plum full. Norms was lookin plenty busy this Friday so we figured wed be in for a hell of a wait. Upon entering the bar any fears were quickly put to rest. Norms is first come first serve, and we were lucky enough to find a perfectly sized table immediately. We ordered some drinks at the bar along with a couple plates of cod with potato pancakes, and took our seats. As we waited we enjoyed our cold Cows, a giant toy speedboat, and the handiwork of some skilled taxidermists. Our nine dollar plates of cod arrived 20 minutes or so after we ordered, hot and fresh from the fryer.The cod was very good. The fish itself was light and flaky with an equally light and flaky batter to match. While the batter didnt have a ton of flavor the three perfectly even sized pieces fish were of the utmost quality and consistently good. The tartar sauce was also very good and really complimented the fish well. I used at least one large squeeze from the bottle per piece regardless of the fact that it was warm. It was thick and tangy with a good proportion of relish. I devoured my 3 pieces of fish in no time flat and probably could have eaten more but didnt realize that you could add more for two dollars per piece until we paid. Usually at a Fish Fry the fish is the star, but at Norms the potato pancakes may have just stolen the show. These babies were the real deal; two, light and flaky pancakes served with sides of apple sauce AND maple syrup. They were simply delicious and possibly the perfect side item for a Fish Fry. The slaw and the bread came on the plate with the fish and both did their job although the bread was better bread, than the slaw was slaw. The little roll was fresh and soft and was just as it should be. The slaw on the other hand, while it looked homemade was a little uninspired. It was very standard and most slaw fans would probably like it, but I just wasnt feeling it. In the end we were both very impressed with the turnaround time considering Norms first come, first serve policy. We were in and out in just over and hour, and when combined with our trip from Madison we were away from home for just over two. Not bad at all. The food was simply great, and the bartenders did a fantastic job of serving drinks and taking food orders at the same time. Overall, this is a great Fish Fry and our thanks goes out to those fans that helped to clear the confusion over Norms Fish Fry. We really enjoyed the cabin atmosphere and appreciated that others had the freedom to smoke if they chose to. I loved Norms Hideaway, and have to say this is a near perfect tavern fish fry. I cant wait to come back for round two, maybe next time I will try the bluegill or the walleye then again, the cod was so good, maybe not.www.normshideaway.comW8639 Kuehn RoadFort Atkinson, WI 53538     (608) 884-6688",3725,0.2982452574525746,0.5301064653503679

A great Fish Fry? Fitzs has that, but so do a lot of places in Madison. Classic Wisconsin cocktails made just the way you like em? Fitzs definitely has those, but then again so do a lot of places in Madison. How about lakeside dining with views that take your breath away? You know Fitzs has that, but Madison has its share of those places too. So what does Fitzs have that most places in Madison dont? How about a great Fish Fry, classic cocktails, and lakeside dining all in onemost places in Madison can only dream of having all that. Fitzs is the total package.Fitzs Fish Fry is also All You Can Eat, which is almost impossible to find in the city in 2015. The fish of choice is haddock and at $12 its incredibly cheap. Fitzs can get very busy on Friday nights, but if you know when to show up you can beat the rushearly bird special, anyone!? On Friday the fish is always frying so it comes as quick as lightning. The haddock loins are pure and flaky making a splendid canvass for the light and bubbly beer batter. This is the kind of fish most people think of when they think of Fish Fry  smooth and tasty, consistent from piece to piece and round to round. Perhaps the best part of the whole deal is that is just keeps on coming and coming until you get sick of it (if such a thing is even possible). Baked, fries, or Au Gratin are the potato choices and the battered French fries are always a good bet. They are extremely crunchy and as satisfying as can be, although unlike the fish arent AYCE. On previous visits hash browns were also available so Im sure had we asked we could have had them as well. Fitzs tartar is not one to be trifled with as its thickness and zip are enough to make even the heartiest of haddock heal. The crusty roll served is a slight step up from a basic dinner roll while their slaw also outpaces the pack. Of course, Fitzs also has a true blue salad bar for those looking for the authentic supper club experience. Theres something about sitting lakeside and eating a Fish Fry that just feels right. Its an idyllic experience that everyone really needs to have for themselves to get the full effect. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and really wish more places in Madison could offer the total package like Fitzs does. www.facebook.com/pages/Fitzs-on-the-Lake/325133513921W11602 County Road V Lodi, WI 53555     (608) 592-3302",2456,0.22837535014005603,0.5269576719576721

As it stands, there are only a handful of restaurants that have figured that out which is kind of strange since we are a city surrounded by water. Its seems only natural that we should be able to enjoy a scrumptious Fish Fry near a placid lake, but if you want that experience your best bet is to get out of town. Once youre in the country youll find a lot more places that have the formula down with perhaps the best in the area being Fitzs on the shores of Lake Wisconsin.Fitzs has been a favorite of ours since we first stepped foot in the door back in 2010. Over the course of several visits we have yet to be disappointed and have really come to appreciate their consistency. Of course, they have a full-blown All You Can Eat Fish Fry at dinner time, and while its also available at lunch for $12.00, the $9.75 2-piece seemed more reasonable today. It was a beautiful day and since we were early we grabbed an open picnic table on the patio by the water. A duo of waitresses were manning the area and one of them buzzed right over shortly after we sat down. Everything was quick as lightning; first a beer, then a salad plate piled high with homemade coleslaw, and then the fish, all within 7-8 minutes. The slaw was rich and creamy, and clearly not from a big jar. It had a deviled egg-like flavor, and a yellowish hue so you now there was a healthy dose of mustard involved. It was hard to not plow it down since it was so good, but we restrained ourselves in order to save some to enjoy along with the fish. The fish was straight-forward, but straight-up delicious. The 2-pieces of haddock were home to Fitzs airy beer battered that clung to the fish when necessary but peeled away effortlessly as if to say: I like you, but dont need you to be great. The fish itself was pristine and flaky and while it seeped a tiny bit of grease it was nowhere near enough to saturate the bewitching batter. Like the fish, the battered fries were also done right. They were thick, julienne cuts with delightfully crispy exteriors and pillow-y innards. They were a spud crunchers delight, and an ideal accompaniment to the juicy haddock. While the fish was stupendous solo it was enhanced evermore by Fitzs tremendous tartar. The thick and creamy blend was a prototypical mix that every other tartar should strive to be like. It put the perfect finishing touch on the haddock, and masked any little bits of grease. Historically, Fitzs provides a dinner roll with the AYCE, but none came with the 2-piece. Also, there was a salad bar upgrade available for $2, but we didnt opt for it today. Fitzs is great year-round, but really takes on a whole new level of grandeur during the summer months. There is just something special about dining at the waters edge and as far as ambiance goes you simply cant beat it. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and will likely be back a few more times before the leaves begin to fall. Its A+ all the way. www.facebook.com/pages/Fitzs-on-the-Lake/325133513921W11602 County Road V Lodi, WI 53555     (608) 592-3302",3174,0.22651097711811996,0.5191839826839827

Its literally standing room only and wait times regularly exceed an hour. The reason for the rush is the All You Can Eat Haddock Fish Fry, which is undoubtedly one of the best the area has to offer. If youre not in the mood to deal with the crowds on Friday Fitzs also offers other fish specials throughout the week. Monday is senior night, its decidedly slower (no pun intended), and the fish de résistance is a bluegill Shore Lunch.  I didnt stop by until 6:30 or so, but luckily for me the $12 Lunch was still available. Since I had some time to kill I had a couple bottles of Spotted Cow first, and wound up putting my order in around 7:15 or so. The food arrived before the bottom of the hour, and I instantly went into fish-mode. The whole plate was steaming hot, but my focus fell squarely on the six small bluegill fillets. Fitzs is known for their beer batter and it works exceptionally well on the pristine haddock they serve on Fridays. The same batter is also used on the bluegill, and while its not bad, its not ideal. The flavorful coating has a beautiful golden color and it very light, but masks the fine taste of the bluegill a bit too much. Some of the subtle flavors did sneak through, but by and large the batter ruled the roost and the delicious fishes were subjugated. Likewise, the battered French fries also ruled, although in a slightly different way. Truth be told, I would rather have had Fitzs signature hash browns with cheese and onion which are not available with the Shore Lunch apparently. The fries were plentiful, and perfectly fried, sporting a crispy batter coated shell and smooth starchy insides. A Solo full of Fitzs tartar sat on the side, but came to the fishs aid as needed. The thick, creamy mixture was right on the money with a tangy zip that added a pop the bluegill. When you call it a Shore Lunch I guess that means you can do whatever you want with it and Fitzs changes things up a bit from their Friday Fish Fry. There is no bread served with the special, and baked beans are substituted for coleslaw. Not having bread is certainly a letdown, but swapping baked beans for coleslaw is basically a push, if not a slight upgrade. The beans tasted like Bushs but are apparently made in-house (which is a huge compliment in our book  Bushs makes some tasty-ass beans). I ate every single bite of them but really would have liked some bread to scoop them onto and sop them up with. While the Monday Shore Lunch special at Fitzs is no Friday Fish Fry, it is very good, and a welcome chance to try some of their fish without having to fight the crowds. The bluegill was tasty, as were the fries, and the tartar sauce. The homemade beans filled in for the coleslaw admirably, and while Id like a piece of bread with any kind of fried fish, its not a deal-breaker in this instance. Overall, I still recommend this Fish Fry even if it doesnt quite fit into the classical definition of one. Fish Fry? Shore Lunch? When youre at Fitzs it doesnt really matter.  www.facebook.com/pages/Fitzs-on-the-Lake/325133513921W11602 County Road V Lodi, WI 53555     (608) 592-3302",3224,0.24895146520146524,0.514771414482953

Both fish boast pristine flaky meat, and when fried correctly are essentially grease free. However, many (if not most) places feel that haddock is a step up from its commonplace cousin and some have moved away from the routine cod and into haddock-heavy waters. Fitzs on the Lake in the tiny village of Okee (on the south shore of Lake Wisconsin) is one such example, and a shining one at that. The lakeside establishment features an $8.75 two-piece option for lunch as well as their $11 All You Can Eat for lunch or dinner. There are no other fish options on Friday, but with haddock this good, you dont really need any. The best fish comes scalding hot, and that is exactly what Fitzs delivers. The first round will host a couple three pieces of golden fried goodies, but make sure to re-up right away because those will be gone in a heartbeat and you dont want to have a big wait in between helpings. The haddock will be smooth as silk and stark white. It features Fitzs light batter which looks like it would fall right off the fish but in actuality clings to it quite vigorously. The AYCE fish pairs nicely with Fitzs near-perfect tartar sauce which is thick and creamy, with a real bite that stands up to the flavorful batter. As with many Fish Frys, hash browns are an option, but if you want to enhance them with cheese and onion there will be a slight upcharge. At Fitzs that nominal sum is worth every penny. The resulting spuds are laced with tons of onion, a nice slice of cheese and when mixed become little slices of heaven. A bit of coleslaw and a plain old dinner roll round out this Fish Fry, and do so without much acclaim. The slaw will be loaded with onion, and have a nice bite, but be nothing to write home about, while the plain old roll serves more to cleanse the palate than anything else. Fitzs is really everything a Fish Fry is meant to be  lots of delicious fish for a fair price. That is just the way things are done in Okee; in fact Fitzs neighbor is the equally great Anchor Away supper club. Anchors Away also offers a fantastic Friday fish feast comprised of the same AYCE haddock, but with even more fish options AND a full salad bar. Regardless of which place you choose you really cant go wrong in Okee  just be prepared to enjoy a couple beverages lakeside while you wait for your table because they are both gonna be busy. Inside Tip: Float on inFitzs has a dock located on Lake Wisconsin for boat-going patrons. Pull in, tie up, and head inside for dinner. Fitzs even has an outdoor patio where you can dine dock-side and watch the calming waters of the lake as they lap against your skiff. Belly up! *Fitzs is in Okee which is roughly 50 minutes north of downtown. If you MUST stay closer to Madison and still want Haddock try Fitzgeralds in Middleton.

Conspirator of fish capers. Lord Fish Fry   Connoisseur of the Fish Fry. A Renaissance man in his own time. Dame Grogenstein   An aging mixologist, wary of the youthful looking.

Grompeir   A coordinator of fried delicacies and satiety inquisitor. It was a day not unlike any other. Birds flew the skies, and snakes slithered cross ground. Twas a perfect eve for two young gentlemen of town to make their way out, for it had been aside a week since last the two partook in one anothers company. They agreed in full that a fishly adventure was in order, be it nigh or remote. Upon meeting shortly after the eighteenth hour, they departed their domicile with extreme haste, bound for placid waters at lakes edge. Fitzs was their destination, and thy delicious fried fish their muse. The pair arrives in OkeeLFF:  Hark! Fair Gabriel, what say thee regarding the scores of vehicles present?SG:  It appearith as though fine fish be fried hind these doors. Fitzs, thy location is bested only by thy divine aroma which finds our nostrils with great abundance.LFF:  Let us make haste! Time must not be wasted as I foresee a multitude of patrons stretching at great lengths to acquire the fried delights held within. To the hostess stand be gone!SG:  Good sir, I must avail myself of the lavatory, please make the necessary arrangements during my leave.LFF:  You dubious bunger I shall comply, for what choice have I?Upon receiving a table preparedness indication device, Lord Fish Fry approached the tipple counter. It teemed with flocks of Fish Fry followers. Lord Fish Fry did that which was necessary to make his presence known. In due course the resident mixologist approached, with due vigilance. DG:  What be your desire? She queried, with a quizzical eye.LFF:  Two of your most frigid Cows would find me most well this eve.DG:  Would they? Inquired the suds slopper. You had best to be showing me some documentation that ye be of the responsibility age for partaking in fine preparations such as these.LFF:  Ah, tis no problem m lady, we oft deal with such unreasonable inquiries. Please verify these credentials to your liking, and politely provide my ale without further ado.After an unnecessary amount of deliberation the identification was returned and twin libations provided. Lord Fish Fry and Sir Gabriel imbibed, and nattered over the intricacies of life, love, art and high culture. Their table had been promised within one revolution of the dial. After one-third revolution, it was time for round two, and Lord Fish Fry revisited the tipple. This time he was greeted not by the craggy barkeep, but rather her assistant. LB:  Another Cow be ye fancy?LFF: Please, damsel of the brew, make it twain Cow, and I will forever be grateful.This go round, the ales were provided posthaste as was the next serving another one-third of the way round the dial. As the clock finally passed one full revolution the pair began to grow wary. Their fears were soon put to rest as their indication device was aglow with flashing lights moments after. They departed the horseshoe they had come to call home, destination  the refectory. Randomo:  Hello my young friends. I hope this day finds you well, please be seated, they servant shall arrive promptly. LFF: as shall some new friends, the proximity of our neighboring table ensures it will be so!SG: How drollAs the two sat, they continued their spirited dialogue, and together gained a better understating of the world around them. They noted the intricacies and the beautiful subtleties of life and Fish Fry. They also took note of the collection of characters parading about the room. Among them, an unwieldy looking soul, who it turns out, was the server for which they waited. Marlmot:  Ahoy lads! I see ye found the bar, how does another round be finding ye?LFF: It finds us well, as does your courtesy. Please also to be adding a duo of Fish Frys to that order before you depart. We are most famished and have been cruelly tortured whilst standing in the bar, forced to witness golden morsels pass us by betwixt kitchen and dining hall. Please, no longer make us suffer thy wrath. Make thy order swift.She sped away only to return in a most timely fashion with Holsteins in hand. Also delivered was appetizing coleslaw that was highlighted with a horseradish flair atop its creamy foundation, and dinner rolls which were adequate, but little more. Sir Gabriel and Lord Fish Fry supped these items, but tried to resist the temptation to fully indulge, All You Can Eat Fish their raison d'être, arrived shortly after. Only upon gazing upon thine fish did the pair finally realize Fitzs majesty. LFF: Friend, this haddock has a light and flaky batter the likes of which is nary rivaled!SG:  Only by the actual fish may it be vested! These loins are tender, flaky, and light as we have seen.LFF:  The combination is truly transcendent, and look, grease is but an afterthought. SG:  And what say you? Can this possibly be the AYCE thou hast claimed? For a mere 1100 pence no less?LFF:  Tis dear friend, tis. Whatsmore, these beer inspired French fried potatoes are also unending. They are a tantalizing tuber, as hot as the fish, and no less delicious. We will be asking for more whence we reengage our server. We shall also inquire as to the availability of additional tartar. SG:  Indeed. I have very much enjoyed this tartar as it seems to be perfectly proportioned. LFF:  I agree, good sir. It is supremely thick, but is blended splendidly. Me thinks the relish has stolen the show.SG:  Indeed.LFF:  IndeedAs the two gentlemen from town made their way through their divine dishes the servant Marlmot lumbered throughout the room. She appeared before them with promises of more haddock fish, and French fried potatoes. Moments later, an additional three pieces of fish, a rejuvenated basket of fries, and more of the splendid sauce surfaced before the two. LFF:  By order of the Queen! I proclaim this fish simply too hot to be eaten. Yet another cruel joke you play, Fitzs! Fish so delicious, but so hot one can not eat it. So clever SG:  Why not tell them to hold it back for a while then, to sit and cool, you would love that! LFF:  Touché, old bean. You speak the truth. I shant complain about the prompt service we hath received, and the well kempt room in which we have dined. With such high turnover, our hosts have done a splendid job keeping up shop. SG:  I must agree with you there. Top notch fare and a lively, accommodating atmosphere have made this a night for the ages. The two finished their bounty after making it to the end of round II. What a fantastic meal they had enjoyed. The All You Can Eat haddock, French fries, and tartar sauce had all been wonderful as was the homemade coleslaw. A plain roll was mundane, but a little room temperature butter perked it right up. Orderly services combined with little benefits are what separate places like Fitzs from the horde. Some places are simply good enough to be recommendable, others are something special As they arrived at the hostess station once more, this time to pay their charge, the two were met by a burly character.  Grompier:  How did the evening find you gentlemen?LFF:  FullSG:  Thine food merits any wait afforded it!  LFF:  Well chappie, I guess, when its time to pay the butcher, the victuals outweighed the impediments. SG:  Without a doubt. A mere one hour wait is forgettable when confronted with Fish Fry of this magnitude. LFF:  Ah yes. We experienced a similar fate at Anchors Away, just across the way. That was nigh on to 2 years ago now. SG:  Long waits? LFF:  Long waits great Fish Fry. SG:  It is difficult to separate the two? LFF:  Downright impossible but is it ever worth it.SG: Agreed good sir. Grompier: Agreed.www.facebook.com/pages/Fitzs-on-the-Lake/325133513921W11602 County Road V Lodi, WI 53555     (608) 592-3302",8173,0.17920285443722941,0.5797341720779222

There are a lot of places that offer the bottomless delight on Friday nights but I have not found many that allow you to mix-n-match all the varieties of fish available. In fact, Hooker’s Resort may be the first. We arrived at Hooker’s around 8:30 and were not surprised to see the place was plenty busy. We put our name on the list and were told the wait would be about 30 minutes, which seemed like a long time for this late in the evening, but we rolled with it. It turned out we barely even had time to grab a drink at the bar before our name was called. Our “half-hour” wait turned into a quick ten minutes.The waitress was at the table instantly, sans menus, and simply asked if “we had been here before?” Since we hadn’t she quickly went over the steak and fish options for us. Among the delicious sounding choices was the AYCE Fish Fry of which you can choose from: cod, walleye, bluegill, frog legs and shrimp. I was not surprised at the variety per se (although it is pretty good) but more at the fact you can get walleye first, then cod, then bluegill and on and on. Most places it is AYCE haddock, or ocean perch but that is it, there is no changing among multiple types. Hooker’s is unique in this regard.We gave her our orders and sat back to enjoy the house salad and warm rolls as we waited the short time for our fish. There was no slaw but the salad with three dressing options more than made up for it. I chose bluegill for the first round and it arrived just as I finished my salad at which point our waitress also asked if we wanted to re-up on fish to which I simply responded: “walleye.” The bluegill was very good, but this first round could have been hotter. The 6 fillets were good sized and enjoyed well seasoned batter which worked well with the fishy tasting bluegill. The walleye which came later was even better and had the same batter but was much hotter and flakier. I would have tried the cod as well but by 8:30 they were out and I think I actually got the last order of walleye which was lucky in itself. Since the cod and walleye were out I got one more half order of bluegill which was fresh fried and better than the first round but still not quite as good as the baby walleye.The tartar sauce was also simply brilliant. It was a great mayo-relish combo but was a little sweeter than most which really worked well with the multiple styles of fish. The French fries were straight cut with the skin on and did their job but were nothing special. Like the first round of fish mine could have been hotter.If you are going to run a waterfront establishments on Wisconsin River you had better serve up a mean Fish Fry, Hooker’s Resort does. The classic supper club ambiance is great and the bar area was hopping with the anticipation of live music later in the evening. Overall, it is clear this is a classic Fish Fry and is worthy of the praise it has received. The food was fantastic and service was quick and friendly too.

We had been to Arthur’s plenty of times and were in the mood for something new so we drove into “downtown.” We happened upon a place called “The Shed” and decided to give it a shot. We enjoyed a pleasant lunch and noticed the Friday Fish Fry on the menu. I knew I would have to come back at some point when I had a good reason to be in Spring Green on a Friday night. It just so happened that May Day, 2009 was that day.I arrived at The Shed a little before 8pm and rounded my way through the crowded dining room to the bar. I put our name on the waiting list, ordered myself a drink, and sat back to watch The Crew for a couple innings. About 15 minutes later, a table was ready for us, but the rest of my party hadn’t shown up yet. By the time she did, the table was gone but we only had to wait couple more minutes for another one to open up. The Fish Fry special at the Shed is billed simply as “Fried Fish - $9.50”. That of course left me wondering what type of fish they were frying. I was pleased to learn it was Haddock. Since this is the only Fish Fry option it made my choice easy, although the “Josh Wang” did sound quite interesting. The fish came about 10 minutes after we ordered and was alarmingly hot. I cracked into the first of the three pieces and was greeted by a mouthful of steam. Besides the fact that I almost burned my mouth the fish was outstanding. It was light and flaky with a delicious batter that held together well and blended with the fish perfectly. It was steaming hot until the end, with the third piece being as good as the first. The tartar sauce was just as good as the fish and maybe even better. When paired, the two combined to create a unique flavor which was nothing less than spectacular. The crinkle cut French fries were less inspiring. They were slightly undercooked which left them a little less than crisp, but they were still pretty good. The Shed has a salad bar but does not give you a trip with your Fish Fry. Instead you get some rolls and a bowl of coleslaw. If you are a fan of onions in your slaw then this was the stuff for you. It was extremely pungent which wasn’t bad, but wasn’t good either. The rolls were fine but not really memorable.It is hard to know what category The Shed falls into. It is not really a Supper Club (although it does have some 70’s style décor), nor is it Modern restaurant. It’s not a “Family Restaurant” but not really a bar either. The Shed is a tweener, and a great one at that. It is hard to put a label on the place but I can easily put on one the Fish Fry: Delicious. I highly recommend this Fish Fry; the food was delicious, the service was fast and friendly, and the dining area was well coordinated by the prompt hostess. Sure the place is kind of small and you may have a little wait, but it is Friday Night in Wisconsin, get used to it. Overall, this was a great Fish Fry and I will now be looking for excuses to get to Spring Green on Friday nights… American Players Theatre anyone?www.shedspringgreen.com/123 N Lexington StreetSpring Green, WI 53588     (608) 588-9049",3175,0.22206315081315084,0.520545123045123

Apparently, most folks were well aware of this fact which left us in an extreme minority, and with a lengthy wait at the bar.  After a solid sixty minutes our light-up coaster finally went off and we had a spot in the dining room (one of the last three of the night, mind you). Since it was starting to clear-out our waitress was over in an instant to get our orders. I went for the $13.00 haddock special and for some reason chose to have the lightly breaded over the beer battered. I added a hash browns with cheese and onion as my side and proceeded to the salad bar (included with all Friday night dinners). Even though it was late, Anchors Away isnt the kind of place that cuts corners and the salad bar was freshly stocked (we actually saw the salad maiden refill the greens neigh-on to 9:00)  not too shabby. We returned to the table to find a side of fritters which is a new addition since our last trip. They were definitely a poormans rendition of the Dorf Haus and the crusty critters werent real fresh. It would seem as though AA has come down with a case of fritter envy. Conversely, the all-Anchors salad bar was off the charts. It featured almost all the good stuff with plenty of options to choose from  cheese spread and creamy coleslaw included. The haddock arrived in a flash and was too hot to handle. While they dont feature their AYCE anymore, the three grandiose pieces were more than enough. The breading was crispy and firm, and not exactly what Id call light. It had a cornmeal crunch that  work well with the thick-cut fish though so all was not lost. While it was very good, it could have used a hint more spice and if I had to do it over again Id likely go for the beer battered. Holding serve with the hearty haddock was a triumphantly thick tartar. The manly mix was creamy, and zesty what Id call Supper Club perfect. The side of hash browns with cheese and onion was also superb, topped with generous slices of white onion, and melty American cheese. The shreds we expertly crisped and danced playfully on my palate. Our waitress was a true pro, and brought everything shipshape, but what was really impressive was the young busboy. He cleared plates in a flash, bustled to-and-fro, easily earning every cent of his paycheck and never once giving any attitude. Well done young man, and well done Anchors Away.When all was said and done, our delay at the bar was a mere afterthought. Yes, next time well phone ahead (I suggest you do the same), but even an hour-long wait was well worth it for an excellent meal like this one. Overall, we highly recommend the Fish Fry at Anchors Away, and would love to come back and try some of their other options if they werent so gosh darn expensive (the walleye, lake perch, and bluegill on the everyday menu range in price from $18-$20).W11579 County Road VLodi, WI 53555     (608) 592-4796",3003,0.17384871120165238,0.4841803185920832

I tried to control what I ate at the reception so as not to fill up too much which was difficult because the food was actually quite good. Luckily for us the ceremony was quick and we were able to get on the road towards Lodi at about 7:30. We took the Merrimac ferry and arrived at Anchors Away in “Okee” at 8:00 or so. The entire drive from highway 113 to Anchor’s Away was lined with cars so we didn’t feel great about our chances at parking near the restaurant. This was mainly due to the fact that Anchors Away is right across the street from Fitz’s. Both of which are right near a major pier on Lake Wisconsin and draw a ton of Fish fry patrons on Fridays. Luckily for us as we pulled up the Anchors Away a tiny spot near the restaurant opened up and we snagged it. Once inside the waiting began.We got our name on the list and headed to the bar to get a drink. One drink turned into two and ten minutes turned into forty-five. Eventually it was 9:00 and we were actually hoping it would be a little longer so we could watch Michael Phelps make his attempt for a 7th gold medal. Just as the race ended and he made the final lurch to reach the wall the hostess came and grabbed us and told us our table was ready. Phelps won the gold and it felt like we won a little something too. Once we were seated the service was very quick as the waitresses were on their game.The special this Friday was Haddock for $11.00 and our waitress pointed out that 90% of patrons on Fridays ordered the Haddock when it was on special and of those 90% ordered it fried instead of broiled. I, like 90% of 90%, opted for the fried Haddock which comes with salad bar. The salad bar was nice and freshly stocked repeatedly, but again I tried no to fill up too much because I knew I had good fish coming.The Haddock came out and it was piping hot, just how it should be. Usually Haddock is served in one big piece. Anchor’s Away either gets smaller fish to fillet, or chops the big ones up because theirs came as 3 smaller pieces which were actually still quite large. The fish was delicious; there is no other way to say it. It was cooked to perfection and flavorful. The straight cut French fries were also delicious and plentiful. The tartar sauce was very good as it usually is at supper clubs like Anchors Away. The bread served with dinner was delicious and unique. It was basically fried dough served with a maple syrup butter which was awesome. Anchors Away is probably one of the cleaner supper clubs I have seen. The family who runs it is clearly very dedicated to their business and it shows. The food was top notch and the service was great. The only drawback was the wait, but I suppose when you have a combination of great setting, great food and great service you are going to have a lot of customers to move through the doors, especially on a Friday night. There were other fish options served as well, namely Bluegill, Walleye and Lake Perch, but strangely no cod anywhere that I could see. Regardless the Haddock was great and I can’t wait to come back and try some of their fresh water fish.W11579 County Road VLodi, WI 53555     (608) 592-4796",3297,0.2655208333333334,0.5406783234126985

Well, as of this week he has sold his house and he will be moving out of “The Belle”.  I figured this might be our last chance to hit up Borland’s, so we made plans to eat some Fish Fry and bid his first home adieu. Our first trip to Borland’s with him was a resounding success. The food was great, the service was quick and friendly and the small town atmosphere was just what the doctor ordered. I knew we would have to come back soon and get a second helping and this seemed like the perfect opportunity.Last time we came it was later in the evening and there was basically no wait. This Friday was a bit of a different story. We arrived at Borland’s at 7pm during the peak rush. The bar area was just about full, as were the 4 or so tables that flanked it.  The line protruding from the dining room signaled that we would have a decent wait, so we grabbed some beers. The line actually moved more quickly than I expected and we actually got seated in about 20-25 minutes which wasn’t too bad at all, especially considering we had a pretty large group. It took our waitress a little bit to get a handle on our large group, but it was worth it. She had no problems splitting up multiple checks and even though she was a little older did a fantastic job with everything. Pretty much everyone in our party got the Fish Fry other than the two little ones who came along (they got chicken strips but were equally pleased). I think the Fish Fry was even better this time than the last time. The batter was great as was the fish itself. It was very tender, flaky and consistent from piece to piece. The French fries were straight-cut style and fit in perfectly with the rest of the deep fried delights. The tartar sauce at Borland’s is good even though it just sits in a massive squeeze bottle on the table. At least one of our fellow diners remarked that he liked it like that. It doesn’t really bother me if it sits there as long as it’s good, and this stuff is. The coleslaw at Borland’s is also ridiculously good. It has to be some of the best out there. The bread they give you with the Fish Fry is a straight forward pre-buttered slice of white bread. Love it. This is a no-frills Fish Fry but usually those are the best kinds. Borland’s has done a great job at keeping it simple but of consistent quality and taste.  What could be better than celebrating the sale of a home with the Zahm fam, Gabe, Brown and our new friend Erika over some great Fish Fry? The food was excellent and the service was outstanding. The adults all had a blast and even the kids had a good time. With Brown no longer be in Belleville it will be harder to justify the drive but I will have to come up with some excuses to get to Borland’s because this Fish Fry is so good and probably worth the drive on its own.119 W.

This week we decided to hit up Borland’s Tavern in Belleville since we had never been there and my friend who lives in Belleville said that it was the place to be on a Friday. After a visit I have to say that he hit the nail on the head, this is a Fish Fry lover’s dream.From our house on the North Side of Madison it is about a 45 minute drive to Belleville. If we lived closer to Verona this drive would only have been about 20 minutes. Borland’s is located right on Main Street in “downtown” Belleville. From the outside you are not really sure what to expect since it looks like a typical Main Street Wisconsin style tavern. Once inside the picture clears up a little. Borland’s is more like a VFW than a regular everyday tavern. Their liquor selection is thin although they can still make a killer Old Fashioned (according to my friend) and have Spotted Cow on tap as well as in a bottle, so I was happy. The bar at the front of Borland’s was sparsely stocked with patrons (and 50 year old deer head mounts) since most of the crowd was clearly here for the Friday Night Fish Fry special which is located in the rear of the building. We got a round of drinks at the bar and headed down the short hallway to wait for an open table in the dining area.We could not have stood there for more than a minute or two before the busboy/hostess peeked out from the kitchen and pointed us to the “second table on the right”. We sat down and our waitress was at the table almost instantly with our placemats/menus and silverware. Judging from the menu Borland’s is only open for dinner on Friday and Saturday nights, but do serve lunches during the week. This lead me to believe that they must do a killer Fish Fry since Friday is one of the only days they are open and the Fish Fry is first and foremost on the list.The fried Cod is a three piece dinner for $8.50 with one extra piece costing $2.25. There is also an option for “Double Fish” for $16.00 but there is no way I was going to attempt that feat. I opted for the “Regular Fish” with the “Extra Piece Fish” for a grand total of four since I was pretty hungry. The Cod was nothing less that excellent. It was light and flaky with a delicious, North Side VFW style, batter which was slightly spiced up and complimented the fish very well. The French fries were straight cut potatoes, fried just right, not too crispy but not soggy at all. The tartar sauce was good as well although it was awaiting our arrival at the table in a big squeeze bottle. We quickly polished off the remnants of the bottle at the table and got a fresh one from the kitchen. It was a good combination of mayo and relish without being overbearing. Borland’s definitely has the big three components of the Fish Fry on lockdown.The bread at Borland’s was a pre-buttered slice of white bread that looked like was torn right off the loaf, very much how my grandma would have done it. The coleslaw was actually great, I was very surprised. I ate my whole portion of the finely chopped cabbage delight and delved into my girlfriend’s portion as well since she was not interested in it. This is some of the best slaw I can remember. The service was actually very good although it appeared that only one lady was running the whole show.Overall this was a great Fish Fry. The food was excellent, the service was friendly and fast, and the atmosphere was great. They even had Slush Puppies in the dining room for the kids (or for the adults who want to reminisce about their childhoods). This place is Wisconsin in a nutshell. If you want to take a nice drive into the country and get a great Fish Fry at the same time go to Borland’s in Belleville, you won’t be disappointed.119 W.

We had a big crew this Friday and with some of us coming from the south and some of us coming from the north, Verona seemed like the perfect meeting point. And of course, when youre in Verona on a Friday night, the 5th Quarter is the place to be.If you like lake perch, youre going to like the 5th Quarter. Their perch is cloaked in a light and crispy breading that has just the right amount of seasoning. The five flaky fillets look as good as they taste and are worth every bit of the $12.00 price tag. It really is everything perch should be. House-cut fries are tough to beat and one of the only ways to do it is with perfectly fried hash browns. Even then its a tough row to hoe, but when theyre slathered with cheese and loaded up with onion the way the 5th Quarter does it its not only possible, its nearly guaranteed. When the conversation turns to tartar the 5th Quarter has a lot to say. Their sauce is thick and creamy, and comes in a big squeeze bottle so there is more than enough to go around. Load up, folks! A big slice of French bread keeps the ball rolling, and the creamy, homemade slaw does all it needs to do and then some. They both do their jobs without overshadowing the fantastic fish or the superior spuds. When we had to please a teething baby, a vegetarian mom, a grandma and grandpa who only like supper clubs, and a cousin of unknown tastes we knew the 5th Quarter would be up to the challenge. Everyone enjoyed the perch, cod, shrimp, and special vegetarian meals they got, and left with fully bellies and smiles on their faces. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and have the 5th Quarter firmly amongst our Friday night favorites. www.5thquarter.biz/161 Horizon DriveVerona, WI 53593     (608) 845-9690",1904,0.1846799795186892,0.5637967229902713

Sure, you can just listen to the masses or go to the busiest places, but if you go those routes you can easily end up with a long wait at a place thats living off their reputation. Thats not to say the crowd is always wrong, but if I always listened to the crowd I would never have discovered the 5th Quarter.The 5th Quarter is down in Verona and situated in an industrial-looking building. While youd think the place would be dark and cold from outward appearances, once the threshold is crossed an inviting atmosphere awaits. There are only two fish options at the 5th Quarter, but since both are excellent more are not needed. Ive had the cod several times, but this was my first foray into the lake perch and it was one for the ages. The perch goes for $12 and comes with all the standard accoutrements. While some places are pawning off other perch-like species on Fridays the 5th Quarter has the genuine article yellow perch. The portion features five fillets with a deliciously light and crispy breading. It was super clean and tasty, and the well-seasoned breading only compounded its delectability. It was really, really, really outstanding and some of the best Ive had recently (and maybe ever). Usually when house-cut fries are on the menu my choice of side is made for me, but today I just had to try the hash browns (cheese and onion available at no charge). It was a nice portion of shredded spuds with healthy chunk of real cheddar and lightly sautéed onions inside. They were superb in every sense of the word, and basically perfect. One of the greatest fears at any Fish Fry is running out of tartar sauce, but its not a concern at the 5th Quarter since they leave a whole giant squeeze bottle on each and every table. Its a good, hearty blend with plenty of zip which really takes the fish up a notch. While the fish, potatoes, and tartar were large and in charge a tiny slice of French bread left a mark of its own with a notable freshness. Some flavorful and zesty coleslaw also did what it could do to not get lost in the shuffle and succeeded as every bite got gobbled up. This is simply a top-notch Fish Fry all around. I literally have no complaints and cant wait to come back again soon. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and think its far and away the best Verona has to offer. Its definitely a keeper. www.5thquarter.biz/161 Horizon DriveVerona, WI 53593     (608) 845-9690",2531,0.27279609279609274,0.5523336385836386

For some reason it took us four years to return and we really dont have a good explanation why. It certainly shouldnt have taken anywhere near that long. This is a great little Fish Fry. Here are four reasons why1st: They do their Fish Fry for lunch and dinner. The lunch features a 2-piece cod for $9.45 and if youre the first customers of the day (like we were) it will come alarmingly fast (there must be some hot oil in these parts). The cod is an extremely flaky rendition that cant be handled without falling apart  its definitely fork food. The fish has a mild, pleasant flavor thats elegantly paired with a moderately-seasoned breading. The coating has just enough pizazz to enhance the fish and stays intact despite some grease seepage. 2nd: French Fries can be substituted for the default baked potato (which is a wise move). The spuds are house-cut, complete with the skin-on and fried to a satisfying crunchiness. They are the kind of fries that make you think Every place should just do it like this.3rd: They pair a superb tartar with the cod that has the right ratio of mayo to relish. The pop it provides puts the pristine fish onto a plateau it could never approach on its own. 4th: The periphery items are good too. A nice, soft piece of French bread is fresh and delicate, and a step up from the traditional dinner roll. The homemade slaw is finely-chopped and creamy but left some remnant slaw water when all was said and done. It was still tasty though. The 5th Quarter is a great little sports bar that really does Fish Fry right. Its clear they take pride in what they do and it comes through in the food, the service, and the atmosphere. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and definitely wont be waiting four more years to come back. www.5thquarter.biz/161 Horizon DriveVerona, WI 53593     (608) 845-9690",1905,0.24360846560846558,0.5218412698412698

This year it just so happened that the first day of the year landed smack dab on a Friday. Since our resolution every year is to eat Fish Fry as often as humanly possible, this turned out to be a perfect way for us start 2010.  In an attempt to constantly build our Fish Fry knowledge base it is necessary to branch out and try new places. We planned to start 2010 off with a bang by trying one of the two places we currently have as must visits (the VFW on Cottage Grove Road or Cahoots in Verona). We wound up in Verona, but to our dismay Cahoots was not serving Fish Fry this first day of the New Year. We were let down, but eventually navigated the tangled streets and landed at the 5th Quarter Sports Bar and Grill. Like Cahoots, the 5th Quarter was not really busy, but at least they were still serving Fish Fry. We pulled some stools close to the bar and ordered up a couple plates of the cod. I got my three-piece with the traditional French fries while Gabe wussed out and went for a two-piece with a salad. As I drank my beer and Gabe sipped his Coke we noticed a small group of people get up from the dining area to leave, among them was WISC TV3 Chief Meteorologist Gary Cannalte. It was funny since we have also seen Charlie Shortino at Leudkes Oakcrest Tavern previously. Apparently our local weathermen like Friday Fish Fry just as much as the rest of us. For some reason I trust them both more now that I know this.Gary and the gang left, and shortly after our piping hot fish hit the bar. The cod was enrobed in a dark and flavorful batter which was as delicate as it was tasty. There is certainly a secret blend of herbs and spices going on here and it totally works. The actual cod was flaky and buttery tasting and was well complimented by this spicier than average batter. The crinkle cut fries that accompanied were also very good. They were extremely plentiful and I actually ran out of fish before fries which usually never happens. Only a perfect combination of tasty fish and plentiful fries could have made this possible, that, and the fact that the delicious tartar comes in big squeeze bottle which means I could use as much as my little heart desired. At this point I was more than pleased. Great fish, local celebrities, what more could a Fish Fry fan ask for? All they needed to do was throw in a decent roll with some slaw and chalk it up as a win. The 5th Quarter apparently knows this drill and does just that with a nice slice of French bread and some chunky homemade slaw.Overall, the Fish Fry at the 5th Quarter is easily recommendable. The fish, fries and tartar were all great, and at $10.50 it is a good value. The establishment itself is clean, and the service was quick and friendly which resulted in us being in and out in less than an hour flat. In the end we have no complaints about this visit and if this first Friday is any indication 2010 is going to be a great year for Fish Fry. www.5thquarter.biz/161 Horizon DriveVerona, WI 53593     (608) 845-9690",3093,0.18506934423601093,0.534246432579766

They were masters of technology, architecture, entertainment, war, and debauchery to name a few. While we associate many great (and some not so great) things with these ancient Romans I have never heard much about their abilities to fry fish. Well, apparently there are modern day “Romans” who do know a little bit about it. MadisonFishFry.com was lucky enough to get a message from “The Romans” (presumably of Wisconsin, not Italy) that there was a great Fish Fry we had yet to try in Verona, it turns out these Romans know what they were talking about.The 5th quarter is in an interesting location near the new(ish) Farm & Fleet. It shares a very warehouse-looking building with several other businesses which gives the area an industrial park kind of feel. The bar is actually very nice however. It looks practically brand new, is very well lit and has a wide open, airy feel. For lunch they offer the same Fish Fry they do for dinner, just in a smaller portion. The lunch Fish Fry consists of 2 pieces of cod with baked potato, bread and slaw for $7.95.I didn’t catch the baked potato part right off but was able to substitute fries after I reread the menu a little more thoroughly. The fish came about 10 minutes after we ordered and was as hot as can be. The cod had a delicious batter almost like you normally see on catfish. It was light and flaky but had some spices in it that made it a deep brown color. It complimented the light and flaky cod underneath very well, it was superb. My only complaint is that it left me wanting more after I quickly polished off my first two. The French fries I substituted for the baked potato were also very good. The crispy crinkle cut fries were fresh from the fryer, and hot as can be. The tartar sauce was also dead on and was delicious with both fish and fries. Boom, boom, boom – Fish, Fries, Tartar.On the side the 5th quarter gives you exactly what they should, a nice simple piece of bread and clean, straight-forward slaw which was likely homemade. Both were easily edible and did a good job of not distracting me from the feature food, the delicious cod. The Romans were right; the 5th quarter has great cod. They also have some other options on Friday nights that I will be back for. The food was great, the place is very nice and the service was quick and professional. Overall this is a great lunch time Fish Fry and I am grateful for the excellent recommendation. Keep ‘em coming people, if you have somewhere you think is great chances are we will too!

We all loved Spuds when we were younger, and thought that nothing could be cooler than the Budweiser mascot. Most of us figured that if, and when, we grew up we would be Bud drinkers based on our love for this hot dog. As adults, we look back on the pompous pooch with fond memories and think back to how loose and carefree our childhood days were. Our first couple trips to Talula were kind of like Spuds MacKenzie. We had a good time and it seemed like everything was cool. The fish was plentiful and the sides helped to make for a great meal. Well, we recently revisited Talula with some friends and found that like Spuds MacKenzie, our memories were better than the actual experience. By the time we got to Talula, around 7:30, our friends were already seated in the dining room waiting for us. We took our seats and figured the sluggish looking waiter would be over shortly. About 5 minutes later he moseyed on by and began to take our orders. Apparently Talula has decided to kick their Friday special into high gear by offing a whole bunch of new fish options. In addition to the once proud AYCE ocean perch and haddock, they have added beer battered cod, lake perch, and walleye. Since I am always willing to branch out, I inquired into the availability of the lake perch. Apparently, wasted waiter forgot to query the kitchen as to which fish were still in stock before coming by, and had to make this trip after the fact. He came back in short order, and reported that the lake perch and walleye were long gone, leaving the untested cod along side the ocean perch and the haddock. Even with this change in options we were ready to order on the spot, but for some reason he wanted to give us some time to think about it. When he finally came back, over 10 minutes later, we were more than ready and getting a little POd with his serving sloppiness.Of the fish eaters, we had one each of: cod, haddock and ocean perch. Soon after the order went in the rolls and the soup/salad hit the table. Talula is known to have some excellent ciabatta bread, but unfortunately they have strayed away from offering it (at least on Friday nights). The warm dinner rolls that have been substituted, while good, cant hold a candle to the ciabatta. In addition the once proud clam chowder also seems to have regressed to a creamy potato mix, which, while tasty, was nearly devoid of any actual clam. After polishing off the chowder and a couple buns the fish was rolled out. I jumped right on it and introduced the fish and tartar to my gullet. The ocean perch was okay, but certainly not as good as it used to be. The fillets were long and pretty meaty; however the fishy taste I have come to expect from ocean perch was replaced with more of a fish stick taste. The texture of the fish fell in line, and the once tender and flaky chunks were kind of grainy and certainly didnt do it for me. It did have a light batter, but even this coating lacked falvor. When all was said and done, and server boy finally came back around to ask about AYCE, I couldnt even handle any more. The reports around the table were that the cod and haddock were both good, but it sounded like the new stars of Talula Fish Fry were probably the sold out walleye and lake perch. So much for the AYCE.Like the fish, the French fries seem to have regressed. The Julienne style potatoes were fried to a crisp and while I found them acceptable, others were less pleased. Luckily, the tartar was a nice blend with a thick consistency that improved fish and fries dramatically. We didnt get any slaw with our Fish Frys, but I certainly think a small scoop is in order especially since none of the fish is less than $11. Overall, I don't think I can still recommend this Fish Fry, especially not as highly as I once did. This visit was just a weird experience, partially thanks to our crazy waiter who just didnt have it all together. Obviously the service was a little off, but so were the fish, fries and the rolls. One of Talulas biggest selling points was their awesome bread and AYCE fish. Once this bread is gone, and all I can eat is one serving, the whole deal kind of loses its luster. Clearly everything has degenerated and the patronage of the place shows it. Lets just say, they are no longer packed to the gills on Friday nights. Much like Spuds MacKenzie in the late 80s, Lent 2010 went out with a thud. The cool, new place, with the funky AYCE Fish Fry seems to have devolved into the corner cutting, stoner hiring, out of lake perch by 7:30, kind of place. In our opinion, the pink cube is on a downward spiral. By trying to run the gamut, they have caused their bread and butter to suffer, which leaves them with a bunch of mediocre options instead of one great one. Their simple AYCE OP, coupled with some great sides had a niche, whereas this new amalgamation of choices falls just above the Mendoza line. www.talula802.com/live/802 Atlas AvenueMadison, WI 53704     (608) 441-1977",4999,0.1733153688416846,0.5122058467847941

I was happy because the AYCE Ocean Perch was very good and the rest of our party enjoyed their veggie options. I heard through the grapevine (and via Talula’s website) that in addition to OP they were also offering Haddock and Walleye on Friday nights so I knew it was only a matter of time before we would make our way to the hot pink cube again. If you have ever driven down Stoughton Road at night it is impossible not to notice the big blue tree aglow with lights at the Cottage Grove Road exit. Adjacent to this tree is the hot pink cube that is Talula. We arrived at about 7:15 prepared for the worst. We were slightly amazed that not only was there not a long wait but we pretty much got seated immediately. The host led us to a “castle” looking room but I would be more inclined to characterize it is a fallout shelter. The walls were adorn with art for sale (although none of this art is going to be making it into my house) which gave the room some character but not much. The waitress came by about 5 minutes later, dropped some menus and took our drink orders. The OP and Haddock are both $11.50 and of the two the OP is AYCE. The Walleye was considerably more and didn’t even cross my mind.Gabe put his order in for the perch and I went for the haddock as it was recommend to a couple fellow diners by a guy wearing an absolutely awesome Schlitz Beer shirt. Another group of “very typical Wisconsin folks” (VTWF) near us also went for the haddock based on this guys recommendation. This trio of humanity was a little over the top but did provide us with some cherry quotes to sum up our evening.Before the fish hit the table we were treated to a choice of soup/salad/slaw. I went for the salad which was absolutely insane. It was a great mix of fresh dark greens and a delicious “ranch” dressing that we dubbed “Ranch Island” since it seemed to be some sort of hybrid. The salad was great and a far cry from the wedge of iceberg lettuce and Thousand Island dressing that VTWF grew up eating. The bread that came with the salads was also spectacular and we had no problem eating the first and second baskets full.The fish came shortly after and was good and hot. Since the OP was AYCE I got to try both styles and still feel like the OP was better than the haddock. The perch was less salty this time which was nice but otherwise the exact same. The haddock was much “lighter” and had a different batter that was good but not great. It tasted much less fishy than the OP which is to be expected but wasn’t necessarily better. Overall they were both good but I like the batter and the actual fish part of the OP better, plus it is AYCE so that takes that cake.The straight cut fries were great but hard to come by. When I have AYCE fish I need more fries to balance it out, as it was I was out of fries long before fish which kind of sucked. The tartar was also kind of sucky. It wasn’t truly bad but really had a strong tartar flavor much like you get in premade brands like Kraft. If it was homemade they took it beyond a balanced mayo-relish mix into the tartarsphere.  After a second visit to Talula I can safely say this is a quality Fish Fry. Talula does what they need to do to make Fish Fry fit in with their style of cuisine without trying to make it too unique, it is still just a Fish Fry after all.

I was happy because the AYCE Ocean Perch was very good and the rest of our party enjoyed their veggie options. I heard through the grapevine (and via Talula’s website) that in addition to OP they were also offering Haddock and Walleye on Friday nights so I knew it was only a matter of time before we would make our way to the hot pink cube again. If you have ever driven down Stoughton Road at night it is impossible not to notice the big blue tree aglow with lights at the Cottage Grove Road exit. Adjacent to this tree is the hot pink cube that is Talula. We arrived at about 7:15 prepared for the worst. We were slightly amazed that not only was there not a long wait but we pretty much got seated immediately. The host led us to a “castle” looking room but I would be more inclined to characterize it is a fallout shelter. The walls were adorn with art for sale (although none of this art is going to be making it into my house) which gave the room some character but not much. The waitress came by about 5 minutes later, dropped some menus and took our drink orders. The OP and Haddock are both $11.50 and of the two the OP is AYCE. The Walleye was considerably more and didn’t even cross my mind.Gabe put his order in for the perch and I went for the haddock as it was recommend to a couple fellow diners by a guy wearing an absolutely awesome Schlitz Beer shirt. Another group of “very typical Wisconsin folks” (VTWF) near us also went for the haddock based on this guys recommendation. This trio of humanity was a little over the top but did provide us with some cherry quotes to sum up our evening.Before the fish hit the table we were treated to a choice of soup/salad/slaw. I went for the salad which was absolutely insane. It was a great mix of fresh dark greens and a delicious “ranch” dressing that we dubbed “Ranch Island” since it seemed to be some sort of hybrid. The salad was great and a far cry from the wedge of iceberg lettuce and Thousand Island dressing that VTWF grew up eating. The bread that came with the salads was also spectacular and we had no problem eating the first and second baskets full.The fish came shortly after and was good and hot. Since the OP was AYCE I got to try both styles and still feel like the OP was better than the haddock. The perch was less salty this time which was nice but otherwise the exact same. The haddock was much “lighter” and had a different batter that was good but not great. It tasted much less fishy than the OP which is to be expected but wasn’t necessarily better. Overall they were both good but I like the batter and the actual fish part of the OP better, plus it is AYCE so that takes that cake.The straight cut fries were great but hard to come by. When I have AYCE fish I need more fries to balance it out, as it was I was out of fries long before fish which kind of sucked. The tartar was also kind of sucky. It wasn’t truly bad but really had a strong tartar flavor much like you get in premade brands like Kraft. If it was homemade they took it beyond a balanced mayo-relish mix into the tartarsphere.  After a second visit to Talula I can safely say this is a quality Fish Fry. Talula does what they need to do to make Fish Fry fit in with their style of cuisine without trying to make it too unique, it is still just a Fish Fry after all. This is also a great Fish Fry to recommend to those people who usually feel “held hostage at the bar” since the place is large and long waits seem to be a thing of the past.

I heard the Mexicali Rose off Cottage Grove Road had reopened under a new name and owner so we decided to check it out. The Friday Night Fish Fry special at Talula consists of All You Can Eat Ocean Perch and there are no other options. If multiple people order the special it comes family style, since I was the only fish eater in our party I got my own plate with three large pieces of the perch to start off. The fish itself was very good, it was slightly fishy tasting but that is what you should expect with Ocean Perch. The batter was firm but not too firm and pretty tasty although it did seem slightly heavy on the salt to me. Overall it was very good and I would almost say it was Esquire-esque. My original portion was so large there was no need for the AYCE because I couldn’t even finish the three monster pieces I got in the first round.For starters you get a salad/coleslaw/soup option. I went for the Clam Chowder with Bacon and it was quite good, although like the fish, it was slightly salty tasting. The French fries served with the fish were great as well, salty and delicious. I think some of the rock salt they spread on the fries may have made it onto my fish which could explain some of the salty flavor. The tartar sauce was good, but slightly sweet. The ciabatta bread that came before our entre was absolutely awesome, there is nothing more to be said. The food was great, and what may have been even better was the service. After having lackluster service the previous Friday it was a drastic change to have a waitress who was on her game. Our waitress wasted no time in bringing our food and beverages and was very responsive to our questions.Talula hit this one out of the park. The fish was good as were the fries and the tartar sauce, they nailed all the staples of a great fish fry. The bread was amazing and the soup was good too. The service topped off the evening to round out a truly great Friday Night Fish Fry. www.talula802.com/live/802 Atlas AvenueMadison, WI 53704     (608) 441-1977",2219,0.3291485452531964,0.537353770260747

Mulligans Bar & Grill in Oregon was the first of the three, and set the bar pretty highly with a whopping plate of walleye. We followed that up with a trip to Montes Grill & Pub in Verona, which was good, but a bit greasy. We came full circle at Mojos Sports Pub & Grill in Waunakee, the third of our three consecutive Ms.When first we visited Mojos in 2008 we were pleased, but not enthralled. Back then the fish of fancy was cod, and little else was available. Today, the menu has exploded, and in addition to cod, bluegill, walleye, and lake perch are all available for the avid Fish Fry fan. With the fish comes a trip to Mojos surprisingly well-stocked salad bar. Unfortunately for yours truly, when we went through there were no plates available, so we did what needed to be done - filling a large soup bowl with a variety of salads. Mojos clearly isnt rolling out the salad bar every day so its no surprise the lettuce was fresh, the slaw creamy, and the cottage cheese curdy  they were likely purchased special for today. There were also some soups available, but we didnt try our hand at them since they looked kind of unappetizing hanging off the end of the portable bar and our hands were already pretty full anyway.No sooner had the salad been polished off than the $10.50 bluegill plate reared its head. The plate was piled high with roughly 10 pieces of fish, although the quality of the fillets varied widely. Some of the fillets were huge and meaty, while others were miniscule, and could barely even be counted as a fillet. Regardless, they were mostly flaky, well-fried, and accompanied by a thin, salty breading. Overall, the flavor was fine and the portion was generous so well set aside the irregularities and give the bluegill the benefit of the doubt.Accompanying the fish was a bountiful side of hash browns which were covered in real cheddar and littered with fried onions. Unfortunately, the large load was over-fried to the point of being blackened and burned tasting around the edges. While the fringes were less than desirable the fat part in the middle salvaged the spread, and still provided an adequate amount of edible spudage.Large solo cups are the conveyance of choice for Mojos thick and creamy tartar sauce, and even MFF couldnt come close to exhausting the supply. The sauce may have been homemade, or it may have been the classic Sysco zip, but either way it perked up the bluegill and drown out any abnormal flavors present in the diverse school.Playing the roll of palate cleanser was a plain old white bun, served with a half warm/half cold pat of butter. If you find yourself in Waunakee on a Friday night and dont want to deal with the rigmarole of a supper club like Rexs Innkeeper, there is relief to be found just down the road at Mojos. The fish is good, the portions are generous, and the crowd is lively. Overall, we feel fine recommending this Fish Fry even if it was a bit of a mixed bag - its our kind of mix. mojospub.net/111 W.

Since I had heard nothing but good things about Mitch’s Utica Bar I decided that was the place to be. Unfortunately, my friends and a few six packs decided that Mitch’s was not the place to be so we went somewhere a little closer to home, Mojo’s Pub in Waunakee.  I had driven past Mojo’s earlier in the day and seen their ‘Fish Fry Today’ sign out front so I figured they needed to be tried at some point. We arrived at about 8pm and decided to sit outside because it was pretty nice out. Even though the place was not really busy it took a while for a/our waitress to come over. I say ‘a/our’ because it didn’t seem like any of the wait staff were responsible for any particular tables. They all just kind of milled around and picked up where they were needed. This is not a great system when you have hungry fish eaters in attendance. Once she did come (or should I say we hailed her down) the order was in quickly. The only fish option is fried or baked cod and our whole table opted for it. Unlike the service the cook must have been fast because the fish was on the table in a matter of about five minutes. The cod was actually quite good and plentiful; three good sized pieces for $10 is not bad at all. The fish was pretty flaky and had a good, not great batter. My pieces were all hot, but not scalding. Gabe said two of his three were lukewarm which is never good. Overall the fish was very edible and I would recommend it. The fries were also delicious as was the tartar sauce which I almost ran out of but not quite, I toed the line there.One thing that was odd was the fact that we got a thing of butter but no bread to put it on. We did get baked beans which I counted as a quasi-substitute for the bread but to be a great Fish Fry you really need some bread in there. The service as I mentioned was not great but the atmosphere of being outside was very nice.Overall Mojo’s is a pretty cool little bar and the fish was definitely tasty. I could easily see myself going back, especially if I was in Waunakee for lunch on Friday some time. Nothing about the meal was off the hook (no pun intended) but everything outside of the service was good.mojospub.net/111 W.

The cod is golden brown and beautiful, the fries are house-cut and cute, the tartar looks untraditional but is tasty, and the sides are all attractive too. Its a well presented plate, but unfortunately looks can be deceiving. The four fat chunks of cod come stacked like a boxed-out campfire and feature a dense batter that has a goodly amount of flavor but is way too thick. Historically the batter features a serious amount of cumin (which helped overcome its girth) but it seems to have mellowed over time (which is a bad thing). The cod itself is totally suppressed by the beefy batter and on the mushy side. There was nary a bit of flakiness left this time around although I know it was there at some point. Eating all four pieces is also quite an endeavor and not one you walk away from feeling light on your feet. The house-cut Alchemy fries are definitely the real deal and the amorphous slices are fried to a dark crispiness. It easily amounts to a whole small potato (or half of a large one) and they definitely get the job done, but little more. Alchemys unique tartar has a ton of taste and while its not the supper club standard it doesnt need to be. Its different but delicious, and the huge cup provided is 100% necessary considering how much fish is stacked on the plate. If Pac-Man ate butter instead of ghosts Alchemys roll would be every bit of 8-bit. It was softer and less dense than that in our memory but the house-made slaw was every bit as unappetizing as we recalled. It was a crudely-chopped concoction with little zip and little flavor. Blah. Weve had a lot of good experiences at Alchemy, but wouldnt call this one of them. They seem to have stagnated somewhat and unfortunately they landed on a thick, bland batter and unflaky fish. Overall, we barely recommend this Fish Fry and think it looks a heck of a lot better than it tastes. alchemycafe.net1980 Atwood AvenueMadison, WI 53704",1967,0.08810876623376628,0.5786796536796538

It was love at first bite. It was another early dinner for our family of three, and showing up at 5pm turned out to be a smart move. By 5:30 it was packed and the wait list was filling up. Since we were so early the oil was hot and fresh, and we had no trouble getting a table big enough for all of us. Our food came about 15 minutes after we ordered and looked fancy. For $13 Alchemy gives you four big pieces of cod, some homemade fries, a sizable cup of tartar, a tiny bit of slaw, and a Pac-Man-looking roll, so even though its on the pricy side you get a lot of food for your buck. Alchemys cod is a unique beast, the likes of which youve probably never seen before. It has a fluffy beer batter that is thick, but also incredibly tasty. Normally we are not fans of thick batters, but this stuff has so much flavor it works, and since the fish is hearty it miraculously balances out. The batter boasts a boatload of cumin which really bolsters the creamy cod and enhances its rich golden-brown color. The Alchemy fries are made in-house and cut into big, amorphous chunks. The spuds are then lavishly salted and fried to perfection before being place alongside the fish. These babies are a far cry from Mickey Ds and the kind of fries kids probably wouldnt like but adults definitely should. Next up is some of the craziest tartar you will find. There is so much in the mix it could never be pieced out, but it still tastes great and pairs well with the flavorful batter on the fish. Since there is so much fish the oversized cup is absolutely necessary, and mine was totally drained by the end. Surprisingly, the share of slaw on the side was super small. It was probably tiniest portion weve ever seen and amounted to a mere three forkfuls. What was there was sweet and fresh with a lemony zest (although that may just have been because the lemon wedge was sitting on top it). Getting chased around the plate was the Pac-Man roll and his power pellet of butter. This hungry little fella was dense and hearty -- a small powerhouse. Watch out Pinky. We fell in love with Alchemy years ago, but still like to come back every so often to rekindle our relationship with their Friday Fish Fry, and what better day to do so than Valentines Day. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry, and adore almost everything about it. alchemycafe.net1980 Atwood AvenueMadison, WI 53704",2430,0.16155820105820107,0.4807301587301586

Consistency really counts when it comes to Fish Fry and the best of the best can do it week after week without missing a beat. On our last trip to Alchemy I was blown away at the quality and uniqueness of their Fish Fry, but this time around was a slightly different story. Im glad I came back.As is now the norm, Alchemy was packed even though we showed up late (8:15ish). We had a group of four (which is probably about as many as youd want to try to bring on a Friday night), and were subject to an hour-long wait in orbit around the bar. Luckily for us, we were in good company and the time passed quickly. We eventually got one of the prime tables in the front window and it went from there. The fish arrived about 15 minutes after we ordered, and was hot but not steaming. While it looked stunningly similar to the magnificent cod we had last trip it had a few flaws that were not present previously. At least two of the four large pieces were over-fried which caused the batter to get hard in spots. These firm zones coincided with areas where the cod underneath was on the thin side, which is what youd expect to see. The two other pieces were better, but the batter wasnt unique and the cod was nowhere near as pristine as our last visit. Perhaps it was just the fact that it was nearing the end of the evening and they were losing focus, but the fish was off and everyone noticed. One of my less desirable pieces even had fryer basket indentations! You really gotta keep them boys movin in there Radiating out from the hub of cod were the rest of the Alchemys signature sides, led by their eponymous fries. While the well-known fries were good, the portion was small and not hot enough. Argh. The coleslaw contingent was also on the scant side, with the visually pleasing fusion comprising a mere two bites (and no, that is not an exaggeration - two bites). It was gone in a flash (if it was ever really even there???). Bolstering the lineup to a minimal degree was Alchemys infamous Pac-man roll which, while hearty and delicious, hardly makes up for so little slaw and fries.At this point a terrible tartar sauce could easily have sunk the ship since the Alchemy Fry was taking on water quickly. Luckily, a serious swashbuckler of a sauce stepped in and saved the day with a spicy flavor and some serious kick. Alchemys signature tartar isnt traditional, but works perfectly with the  cumin-infused coating on the cod. The chipotle-looking concoction bailed water like a mother and saved our sinking schooner with grace. Fish Fry is a finicky mistress and even one bad plate can be enough to turn patrons off forever (we Wisconsonites are a stubborn lot dontcha know?). Luckily, Ive had enough fish at Alchemy that even a couple bad pieces dont necessarily spoil the lot. Overall, we still recommend this Fish Fry and believe they have a recipe for success. At this point they just need to continue hone their craft until every plate is as good as the one I had the last time. I bet our next one will be...alchemycafe.net1980 Atwood AvenueMadison, WI 53704",3215,0.0653048340548341,0.4790945165945167

Their Friday special started humbly as a hearty meal for a good price, but has since blossomed into something more Something better Something truly special I dont think Im alone in saying this, but it really has evolved in to one of the best Fish Frys in the city. Let me tell you about itThe first thing you need to know is that Alchemy is going to be pretty damn busy, and youd better be ready to wait your turn. The locals (and probably a lot of non-locals too) have taken a shine to this Fish Fry, and they are packing the place on Friday nights (especially around 7:30 apparently). If youre like us, youll luck into a couple stools at the bar within 15 minutes or so, but if you want to eat at a table be prepared to wait it out with a couple cocktails (luckily, the bartenders at Alchemy are real pros so that shouldnt be a problem). When you do get your fish (and rest assured there will be plenty of orders whizzing past you to get you in the mood) it will be scalding hot  so watch yourself. Alchemy features beer battered cod, but it isnt your typical portion nor is it your typical batter.  The portion is GIGANTIC (four 3oz. pieces) and the batter is nothing less that amazing. The batter, while on the thick side, is not heavy at all, and has an incredible flavor that needs to be tasted to be appreciated. It is clearly a secret blend of spices, featuring some cumin and/or red chili powder that gives it a unique and memorable flavor. While the batter might look thick, it melds perfectly with the flawlessly white and flaky cod. Amazingly it wont leave any grease whatsoever, and while 12 oz. might seem like a lot of fish, its so good youll hardly even notice its enormity. Mine was gone in an instant. Alchemys signature fries are also superb, and while you dont get a ton of them, I cherished everyone I received. While the potato chip-like cut is a little unusual, the taste is what really matters and the fries are perfectly spiced. The tartar is something special, and like the fish, is clearly a secret recipe. It is a thick mix with so many miscellaneous items in it that it is impossible to dissect them all. It has a beautiful reddish-hue, and a little bite which pairs perfectly with the cod. It is euphoria for your taste buds, simple as that.As you might expect based on Alchemys reputation for freshness, the coleslaw is made special for Friday and crisp as all get-out. While the portion might be miniscule and the slaw itself isnt zesty enough, it plays its role as side dish effectively. The roll is also a step up from your average dinner roll, but takes a backseat to the fish, fries, and tartar. Its main function is to serve as a palate cleanser and to this end it does its job splendidly. In all honesty I really cant wait to go back and have the fish at Alchemy again. As far as beer battered cod goes it has to be some of, if not the best in the city, and probably in the greater Madison area in general. Alchemy has obviously figured it all out and is running their Fish Fry on all cylinders at this point. Its like watching Babe Ruth in his prime. Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this Fish Fry (with a capital HIGHLY even), and think you owe it to yourself to try if you havent yet. You can thank me later. alchemycafe.net1980 Atwood AvenueMadison, WI 53704",3393,0.2306136820925553,0.5435144198524481

Look right  another open seat and a younger chick on her laptop shopping for god knows what. Where are the hipsters? Maybe behind me? Look over my shoulder  the place is busy, but there are hardly any large rimmed glasses or skinny legged jeans to be found. Am I at the Alchemy? I thought only intellectual types hung around this place, with their air of superiority and Elvis Costello looking hats. What is going on here? Did I somehow leave Madison and stumble into Never-never land?Maybe Friday just draws a different crowd? Or maybe it is just too early for the hipsters to arrive; I mean the sun is still up after all. I guess it doesnt bother me one way or the other, Im gonna order a Fish Fry. Hey barkeep, is it cool if we sit at the bar and eat? It is? Sweet. How bout you chuck a couple of pieces of that beer battered cod in the fryer for me and grab a Matilda for the little lady? Were hungry. 15 minutes, or so, pass and four Fish Frys sit idly at the servers station. Where do you think those plates are headed, my love? Not sure? I bet one of em is mine For shame, look at my fish, just sitting there, getting cold and collecting grease. Maybe it aint mine? I kinda hope not. Well, there go three of them, out into the crowd behind us, only one left. Uh oh, I think that is your Matilda yup, sure nuff, it is, and the last of those four Fish Frys is mine. Here it comes. Plates are served, and still look lovingly prepared even after a few stalled moments at the counter. Wow, I am surprised. This fish has been sitting for a good 4 minutes, but is still nice and hot. And wow! What a great beer batter. It is nice and light, and really flavorful. The cod itself is also pretty boss, although I bet by the time I get to the end it will be a little mushy, it is nice and flaky now. Mmm mmm mmm. I am gonna hit that tartar with it and see what happens. This tartar looks weird, but what the hell, what doesnt kill me only makes me stronger, right? Whoa! Even though it is kinda thin (and looks ranch-y) it tastes awesome! What is that? Chili powder? Cayenne pepper? Whatever it is, its wonderful, and combines with that beer batter to take this fish to the next level. Awesome! I gotta get a fry or two in. Hey, wait a minute. These chip-looking fries are really good (I saw the dude spray them with some vinegar back there), but a few of them are cold. What is going on here? Were there some remnants left in the bowl from an old batch that snuck onto my plate? Hmmm, lucky for me, the bulk of them hot and crispy, and really compliment the zesty cod/tartar blend with a little vinegar zest of their own. Ill look past those couple oddballs, I guess. Wow, I am really impressed. The Alchemy seems to have stepped their Fish Fry up a notch and look, a nice little wheat bun! Last time we were here there was nothing starchy to speak of and now we have this delightful Pac-man roll, complete with a pat of butter in his gaping jaws. Way to go Alchemy! Man, this Fish Fry is really something. I bet the coleslaw is still kickin ass too What what? It is! My dear lord, usually this red cabbage has some serious bite but whatever they have done to it has really quelled its boisterousness. This stuff is sweet and mild; I bet I eat ever last bite. The slaw, roll, chips and fish are gone. An empty plate with a disheveled cup of tartar and a greasy napkin are all that remain.Well, my dear, it looks like this trip to the Alchemy was a total success. You got to enjoy one of their delectable veggie dishes while I got my Fish Fry (and loved it). I guess we will have to put them #1 on our list of places that have a great Fish Fry and great veggie options  I certainly cant think of one better at this point. You agree? Well then, let us count our blessing as we truly have experienced a great meal. And look, it is only 7:45 or so.

I always thought it was a unique establishment with a lot of original wood work, various levels for seating and an elevated bar. I had even enjoyed their Fish Fry on a couple occasions. Well, the building Wonders occupied was not closed long and recently reopened as Alchemy which seems to be slightly more upscale than Wonders was. Wonders was a very neighborhood bar kind of place while Alchemy is has more of a modern feel.  The everyday menu is chock full of delicious sounding dishes that abound with local, high quality ingredients. I have had their burger and it was very good so I assumed the Fish Fry probably was too. On Friday Alchemy serves a Fish Fry special for dinner but not lunch. The Fish Fry will run you about $11.00 and consists of 4-5 large pieces of cod with your choice of potato, and homemade red cabbage coleslaw. I obviously got the cod which was good but not great. It was very rich and creamy partially due to the batter which was very substantial and pretty much dominated the taste of the fish. The fish was not very flaky or tender and was borderline mushy, but still tasted pretty good. I think it is actually the same fish that they used to serve at Wonders which was always perfectly acceptable.The French fries were basically potato chip style slices which were good for being a non-traditional cut. The coleslaw was actually very good and I think I ate all of it. The tartar sauce that came with the fish was decent but fairly dilly tasting, and just not great which probably contributed some to the fact I could not finish my fourth piece. One problem with this Fish Fry was the fact that they did not serve any bread. I would gladly have sacrificed my fourth piece of fish for a nice slice of rye or a cheap roll. It is nice to have more fish than you can even eat but I would rather have some bread to balance it all out. It is great to have the Alchemy in the Atwood neighborhood. They have really done a nice job revamping the place and putting out good food that is in tune with their local residents. The Fish Fry was  good and the quality of the food certainly comes through.alchemycafe.net1980 Atwood AvenueMadison, WI 53704",2268,0.27815542328042325,0.5275330687830688

Jim's Roadhouse,"Overall, I would not recommend this Fish Fry.",Good,Good,Good,Poor,Good,"For some people cheap is everything. Even if the product is inferior these individuals could care less as long as its priced accordingly (McDonalds anyone?). While I like a cheap meal as much as the next guy, I definitely dont mind paying up for quality, especially when it comes to my Fish Fry.Youll find Rev. Jims Roadhouse on the access road to Ho-Chunk and while the casino can get expensive the grub at the Revs is anything but. The Friday special is a Fish Basket that goes for a scant $5 (which is just a buck more than a tap beer). As you might expect, the portion is on the small side, but for $5 you cant really complain. Things are a little different at the Roadhouse and rather than 3 or 4 regular-sized pieces the basket comes with 8 fish nuggets. The nuggets are extremely pop-able, with flaky meat, and a light breading. Despite the flakiness the fish isnt pure white which leads you to believe it isnt of the highest quality. The breading has a great texture, but lacks the seasoning that would enhance the fast food feeling fish. A conservative allotment of julienne-cut fries fills out the basket and are fine, but nothing special. Theyre likely from one of the major food distributors, but still tasty when adequately fried. Some zippy tartar scoots along on the side and tastes pretty Sysco-y as well. The eighteen-wheeler origination theme continues with some zesty slaw that is almost certainly not made in-house. For five bucks its hard to expect bread with the basket and sure enough the Rev keeps the starches all to himself. While I appreciate that Jims is keeping the cost of their fish down, it certainly comes at the expense of quality and quantity. Overall, we dont recommend this Fish Fry even though its the cheapest weve ever found. Theres just not much to like, unless youre one of these people who only cares about the fact that its cheap. www.revjimsroadhouse.com/6402 Millpond RoadMadison, WI 53704     (608) 310-4230",1972,0.11545474045474047,0.5339232089232088

Jim's Roadhouse,"Overall, I would recommend this Fish Fry.",Good,Good,Excellent,Poor,Good,"Madison Fish Fry is nothing if not a gambler. While some fish fans find one Fry they love, and stick with it, we feel the need to throw caution to the wind, and peruse the places others fear to tread. You never know what lays beyond after all sometimes those gambles pay off. We have known about the Fish Fry at Rev. Jims Roadhouse for a while now, but as tends to happen, we never rolled the dice on the unheralded establishment. Rev. Jims is located on the frontage road to De Jope, and if youre like us, you dont necessarily expect much from a Fish Fry at the remodeled McDonalds on the way to the casino, you just dont. I arrived around noon to find only two other cars in the parking lot, and all I could think was Oh well, at least this will be cheap.The Friday lunch special at the Roadhouse runs a mere five bucks and I had mine in a matter of minutes. As soon as I saw the fish I knew I was holding a winner and my $5 gamble was going to pay off big. My plate was piled high with upwards of ten small fish nuggets, a generous helping of shoestring fries, and a couple of Solo cups full of coleslaw and tartar. I dug in.The fish was hand breaded and made to order (for $5 I was half expecting Van de Kamps or some such nonsense). The breading was light and flaky with a fair amount of salt giving it a pleasant flavor. In addition to the 10 fish bits, a few stray breading chunks made the journey from the fryer, and even without any actual fish in them, were salty and delicious. The cod itself was fine, but didnt look to be of the highest quality as some pieces were translucent looking rather than pure white. While these oddballs were still mostly flaky, they got a little greasy and were not the most appetizing to look at. Luckily, the breading was enough to compensate any flaws the fish may have had and make for an overall pleasurable plate.The shoestring fries were mixed in with the fish in such a way that both fryer baskets appeared to have been dumped onto the plate simultaneously. It was a matrix of frydom that even I felt the need to organize if for no other reason than to see exactly how many nuggets were mixed in there. The thin-cut spuds were your standard freezer-to-fryer fare and just about average, but certainly adequate, especially for $5.While it came in the standard 2 oz. Solo cup, a surprisingly splendid tartar sauce was anything but basic. The Revs tartar was thick and creamy with enough zest to mask any irregularities in the fish. Good stuff.Rev. Jims Roadhouse bills their Friday special as a Fish basket which in our book usually means no bread. Well, lo and behold, we were right, and even though the menu stated there would be a roll, none was provided. Instead we settled for a 4 oz. cup of shockingly good coleslaw. The crispy, creamy slaw did its part as the mellow zest added a nice change of pace to the meal. What can we say? Once again our gambling ways paid off. I guess when it comes to Fish Fry you just never know so you might as well take a chance now and again. Overall, we are very impressed by this little Fish Fry and we have no problem recommending it especially at that price. www.revjimsroadhouse.com/6402 Millpond RoadMadison, WI 53704     (608) 310-4230",3242,0.17089498299319722,0.4842602040816327

The food was delicious and the banquet hall the Fish Fry was held in was just fine. I read about the Fish Fry at Wildcat Lanes in Verona and it sounded like a similar experience awaited us there. While it was similar, it was not quite what I was hoping for.  We arrived in Verona around 8:30 and were shocked to see that there was basically no one left in the restaurant and they were practically ready to close. Usually if you show up for a Fish Fry around 8pm you are greeted with big crowds and a sizable wait, this was certainly not the case at Wildcat which made me slightly uneasy. They told us to sit down anyway and they took our orders. The Fish Fry special consists of two or three piece of deep fried haddock with an extra piece for $2; we opted for the two piece but should have gone for three.The haddock was actually really good. It was light and flaky and obviously high quality. Like I say I could have easily devoured a third and maybe a fourth piece. It enjoyed a light batter which was good but not overly flavorful. The fries were also quite good. They were crinkle cut and served in large quantity such that I had many to finish once my two pieces of fish were gone. The tartar sauce was also above average but was a little heavy on the relish. It also seemed to have a little something extra that I could not pin down.Before we even ordered we received a basket of bread and a bowl of slaw. While they were a nice precursor for hungry mouths, they were both uninspired and bland much like the “banquet hall” itself. The restaurant is basically one large room that I assume gets used about once a week. It is probably just fine when abuzz with people but when you are the only group present it feels a little creepy. The waitress was good and tried to make it seem as cozy as possible but there is only so much you can do really.Overall this is Fish Fry is borderline recommendable. The atmosphere certainly leaves something to be desired, but the food was actually pretty good and the waitress was very accommodating.

Since it was not even 5pm and we put our orders on hold and watched the rest of the game as well as some of the post game commentary.

The Perch was also plentiful, at least 6 or 7 monstrous filets (at least monstrous for Perch).The French fries were also delicious. They were as homemade as it gets and fried just right.

A local Fish Fry lover sent us a message and suggested that we needed to try the Spring Creek Tavern in lovely Lodi. This particular Friday it was a boy’s night out Fish Fry and we had our pick of the stanked-out greasy dive bar of our choice. Since the Spring Creek Tavern has the word Tavern right in the name we figured this would be a perfect opportunity to try such a place.We took the fifteen minute drive up 113 to Lodi and arrived at the bar at about 7:45 or so. The Spring Creek Tavern is situated adjacent to the Spring Creek (appropriately enough) right on Main Street in Lodi. The Tavern is actually pretty nice inside, not a stanky dive bar. The place was not packed, but it was definitely busy. We put our name on the list on grabbed a drink from the bar. We heard that the wait at the Spring Creek was always very short so I was somewhat surprised when the hostess told us it would be 20 minutes. We rolled with it assuming it would be far less, but exactly 20 minutes later our beers were empty and our table was ready. The Fish Fry special at the Spring Creek Tavern consists of All You Can Eat cod. Apparently on Wednesday nights they have a special as well but you have your choice of Bluegill, Lake Perch or Walleye. Needless to say, we will be back on a Wednesday at some point. The Friday Night Fish Fry at the Spring Creek Tavern was good, but not great. The fish and the French Fries came out in baskets for us to grab and heap onto our plates. The batter was definitely light but didn’t have a lot of flavor and was kind of crumbly. The fish itself was flaky, but a little greasy and slightly, and I mean slightly, processed tasting. Gabe said it tasted like the best fish stick he’d ever eaten which I would not disagree with. However, the best fish stick still does not compete with a decent Fish Fry. The fish was good and I would recommend it but I have had much better cod in the past. The French fries were very good and clearly homemade with the skins on.Before the fish came we were greeted by a lovely basket of rolls, a good bowl coleslaw and some delicious baked beans. These items were all very good and did a nice job of setting the scene for the AYCE.This was a good Fish Fry, no doubt about it. However I’m not sure I would really want to go out of my way to get it. If you are in Lodi on a Friday (or Wednesday) it is definitely a reasonable place to stop and grab a Fish Fry, but if I had a choice I would still pop into one of the local Supper Clubs.118 South Main StreetLodi, WI(608) 592-3965",2628,0.2536621857674488,0.5206763752816387

The cod was All You Can Eat for $10 while the bluegill was $12 for six nice sized fillets. The Bluegill was the better of the two and had a unique batter that almost looked like buffalo sauce. It was slightly spicy but actually good with the classic bluegill underneath. The cod was less expressive. The long, thin fillets were covered in a thick, crispy batter which took over the taste of the fish. Both were not “Fish Fry hot” when served, which may have been partially responsible for their lackluster performance. Although, the AYCErs did get hotter cod on the second and third rounds and they were still nothing special.Much like the bluegill the French fries were very good and could have easily been great if served at the peak of their deep fried freshness. The tartar sauce (which our waitress forgot on the first time through) had a tiny bit of dill which didn’t ruin it but certainly didn’t help it. Overall it was just kind of so-so, as was the slaw which was edible but not memorable. The two pieces of rye bread on the plate tasted fine but looked horrible with (fake?) grill marks across their limp, soggy bodies. Can “bad” services really ruin a Fish Fry? Well, MadisonFishFry recently got a nasty letter from someone who had a bad experience at the Esquire Club similar to what we had at Hawthorn’s and it makes you think.

I was curious if all three places had the exact same Fish Fry since the Fish Fry at The Locker Room was good, but not great. Not everyone is up for a Fish Fry at a bar but I was rolling solo so I decided this was as good of a time as any to give Murphy’s Tavern a whirl. I arrived at Murphy’s around 12:30 and noticed there were quite a few cars in the lot which made me think the Fish Fry would be decent. There were 3-4 groups of people seated at various tables and another 5-6 seated at the bar, many of whom were enjoying the special. I grabbed a stool then ordered a Spotted Cow and the fried Cod for $6.75. In addition to the Cod there was also Tilapia available but I was not about to risk that.The fish was ready about 5 minutes after my order went in and was brought right up by the speedy bartender/waitress. The Cod was actually good although not very consistent, as was the case at the Locker Room. I got two pieces of Cod, one of which was tiny while the other was massive. Luckily for me the massive chunk was well cooked and tasty while the tiny piece was overcooked and chewy. The batter was light and flaky as was the fish. If I had had two of the big pieces they would certainly have scored higher however. The French fries were crinkle cut style and very good. There were also an absolute ton of them which is nice. I definitely did not run out. The tartar sauce was also on the money and plentiful. A standard roll was served which was perfectly acceptable as was the coleslaw, which may have been homemade but still didn’t taste that great. Murphy’s Tavern is a bar-bar, no doubt about it. It has the aura (and the aroma) of a classic tavern. If you have been to the Locker Room you have been to Murphy’s and vice versa. They are those kind of places, not the place to take a date, but a fine spot to grab some Fish Fry. I assume the third establishment in the trio (Beck’s) was formed in the same mold and I will need to stop down there to try their Fish Fry sometime. Overall, this was a good lunch time Fish Fry. The food was fine, the service was quick and the bar was there. It certainly isn’t anything fancy and it would be nice if the fish was more consistent but everything was about average. www.becksbarz.com/murphysmenu.htm3737 E.

If you've lived in Madison for any length of time you've probably whizzed past it a million times and never given it a second thought. For all you whizzers, the places is called the Game Time Sports Bar and Grill and for most people it's one of those bars that is just there and seems like it always will be...for others (most notably tradesmen on their lunch hour) it's a local staple.It had been a looooooong time since we'd sampled the Fish Fry at Game Time, and when a co-worker told us that they were under new ownership and/or management and suggested we give them another shot we were in total agreement. We stopped by on an available Friday for a quick lunch and found out just how busy things get down on the corner at noon. We rolled up about 11:30 and the ENTIRE bar was packed with bearded dudes in safety-green shirts. The few high-top tables scattered about the periphery were also mostly occupied but we happened to stumble upon the one low table in the corner. We took it as a sign, and a good sign if I'm being completely honest. We saddled up, caught the lone bartender's attention and ordered a cheap 2-piece cod and a Bloody Mary. Since the whole show was being run by that one bartender and one cook, everything took a little bit longer than normal, but we weren't in a huge hurry, save for wanting to get to the store to buy a couple Christmas gifts. Despite the longer than anticipated wait everything was  still hoter'n crap when it arrived so clearly there was no lack of focus, just not enough hands on deck. The fish was slightly better than that in our memory and featured a dark breading that sloughed off the surface in spots. The coating had a nice crunch and enough seasoning to make it noticeable. The fish itself seemed to be average quality and while we were pleased with the 2-piece for lunch, we'd definitely go for the 3-piece dinner time. The Game Time slings the standard crinkle cut fries, so there's nothing much to report on them. They were well-fried, I guess? The tartar also seemed to be the Sysco standard stuff which was pretty pickle-y and controlled to cod if applied too liberally. It was s thick mix for sure, but the dill flavor was just a little overbearing for my tastes. A cup of coleslaw was highlighted by a hint of horseradish that made the concoction a little something more than just creamy, while the basic white roll was squished (as packaged rolls so commonly are).Game Time certainly has some things to hang their hat on, most notably their visibility on one of the busiest intersections in all of Dane County and their friendly service. As far as the Fish Fry goes, you can't really go wrong with the price, and while everything was pretty much up to snuff, I just can't see myself rushing back in. Overall, we can't quite recommend this Fish Fry, but think it's worth a stop if you happen to be cruising by. 6862 County Road KMiddleton, WI 53562     608-831-2401",3021,0.09165454308896934,0.47150959241123175

Eventually K runs into Highway 12 at a pretty major rural intersection. This intersection is home to a gigantic Mobil station on one side and the Game Time Sports Bar on the other. Since the GPS kept sending me this way and I knew the Game Time had a Friday Fish Fry I decided this Friday was as good of a time as any to give them a whirl.The Game Time is a very nice and clean for a rural Wisconsin bar. There are a fair number of TVs and some tasteful Packers memorabilia as well as a fantastic collection of football helmets representing each of the teams in the Big 10. They definitely have a Fish Fry for dinner every Friday, but based on the bartenders response I don’t think they do lunch every Friday. We lucked out and the fish was “ready” for lunch today. Since it is technically the dinner portion it is a little more expensive that you would expect at $9. We got our food within a few minutes of putting our order in and it was decent but not really good. It had a light batter but the fish itself tasted like it was more processed than average. When it was teamed with the generic tasting tartar sauce the taste was reminiscent of a fish stick. The French fries were your average straight-cut bar style fries, nothing special. The coleslaw was also not very tasty. It had a hint of horseradish or something at the end but even that didn’t really help. The roll that came with the Fish Fry was lightly toasted and just fine but also nothing special. There was nothing about any of the sides that really helped make up for the lackluster fish. We were not the only ones eating at the Game Time, but as far as I could tell we were the only ones that tried the Fish Fry. Almost everyone else had burgers and seemed very happy with them. This is a classic case of having a Fish Fry just because it is expected and not going the extra mile to make it great. If and when we go back to the Game Time we will get one of the tasty looking burgers. Overall there is no way I can recommend this Fish Fry. The place is great and the food looked delicious, but the Fish Fry was just a little generic tasting and missed the mark. The next Fish Fry we get in Ashton will be at Saint Peter’s Church, they know what they are doing. As for the Game Time, stop by for a burger but find you Fish Fry fix elsewhere.6862 County Road KMiddleton, WI 53562     608-831-2401",2454,0.11588095238095239,0.47002164502164495

Best Fish Fry in town? Maybe??? Probably??? Certainly the best lake perch...We were heading out of town at noon, so I scooped up the little man and headed to the Villa around 11:00. We had the typical perfect perch with a side of fries. These perch were real fat ones, complete with that spicy breading that is just to die for. Best of the best, you say? Prove me wrong, I say... Fries were a change-up. No longer skin-on spuds, but a dash of season salt perked the plain Juliennes up just enough. Look up tartar sauce in the dictionary and this is the picture you'll see. It's ideal. It improves a fish that's impossible to improve upon...figure that one out, 'cause I can't. The Villa slaw has always been good, but this one seemed new. It tasted fresh, was not as creamy as were accustomed to, and in all honesty wasn't quite as enjoyable for me. However, the rolls were definitely a new breed. These weren't grandma's old dinner roll anymore. They were rounder, denser, more consistent, and crustier. In a word, they were delightful and a vast improvement. Let's hope Chico sticks with it. New rolls? Good. New slaw? OK. New fries? whatever. Same old tartar and perch? Hallelujah!!! In all honesty this one is all about the fish (which is what any good Fish Fry should be about), and to that end the Villa nails it. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and really do think it's the best lake perch anywhere.

We seek the white whale and the The Captain and I believe to hath found it at thine Villa Tap.Moby Dick in this case is not white nor a whale, although based on the size of the the Tap's walleye fillet one would be hard pressed to prove otherwise. For $14.75 a fillet comes that rivals a $25 dinner most anywhere else. It's thick and meaty and every bit of 12 ounces if not more. It's a massive chunk which would leave even the saltiest dog feeling like a one-legged Ahab fighting for dear life. Unlike the doomed captain however, we tore this cold-blooded carnivore limb from limb and juicy flake from juicy flake, devouring his succulent flesh over the course of 15 or so sea minutes. He was a tasty beast with a fantastically spicy crust, and a most satisfying flavor. Plenty of potato oars paddle this Pequod to the whaling grounds with a satisfying saline slather and skin-on structure. They're basically done as well as a freezer fry can be done, which is about all you can hope from a galley the size of that in the Villa. Cement shoes have sent many-a bloke to the bottom of Davy Jone's locker and Chico's tartar will do the same. This mix is concrete in the making and clings to whatever it touches with reckless abandon. This mortar has the pop to pay the rent, the skillz to pay the billz, and easily tames the scurviest of sailors. A soft and plush roll preserves the life of the Fry, and while this swabby was sorta smooshed is still kept things afloat. A new variety of slaw lacked the creamy texture of yore, but still brought the crisp bite of a spring Nor'easter to the fierce Midwestern winter. This walleye truly is the white whale all of Madison is after. It's a behemoth of a fish, and enough to sink your ship and most any appetite.

On my last two trips to the Tap I've had the walleye and the lake perch and both were above reproach (as per usual). They both come in at $14.75 which, in 2018, is a good deal - you'll find walleye runs upwards of $20 almost anywhere else, while perch comes in somewhere between $16 and $18. The walleye Chico serves are the biggest the city has to offer and typically hang off both sides of a standard-sized dinner plate. These things are honkers and not for the faint of heart. Likewise, the perch fillets are princely, and about as jumbo as real lake perch gets (if you find ""lake perch"" fillets bigger than these start thinking Zander). All the fish at the Tap share the same ultra-flavorful, flaky breading that takes their inherent deliciousness into places most fish only dream of going. It's the best of the best, and never greasy or over-fried (at least in my experience). Most everything else at the Villa is standard and it really has to be since frying the fish takes up the bulk of the cooking space. That said, Chico has started adding a little season salt to the skin-on freezer fries which gives them a little kick, and the tartar is bold and zesty enough to wrangle the wildest of fish. Some creamy slaw and a grandma's dinner roll round things out, and while they don't make you stand up and take notice, they are always there and I hope always will be. The Villa is 100% my go-to Fish Fry at this juncture and while I make it a point to avoid the dinner crowd, chowing down at lunchtime is no less enjoyable.

Sure I couldn't walk or even get out of bed for that matter, but come hell or high water I was going to have my fish.Luckily for me we live pretty close to the Villa Tap and since my wife works at the University she was on winter break and available to help me out. I just got to call in my order and sit back and relax as she went to grab it and rush home before it got cold. It was an amazing ballet of coordination and unselfishness on her part and I just got to reap the rewards. My wife, let's call her Speed Racer, had the fish from the parking lot to the bedside within five minutes (and that is no exageration). First thing I noticed when I popped the lid was the absence of the coleslaw and the roll, but I didn't specify I wanted those when I ordered so I guess that is on me. I dove right in to the perch and fell in love all over again. It was all the classic Villa taste but without the classic Villa setting. It was juicy and flaky, and highlighted by a 100% grease-free, crumbly breading. It is simply some of the best tasting fish around and there was something oddly satisfying about eating it in your own bed while doped up on pain meds. A big old pile of fries kept the fish aloft so the pristine loins never neared the wax paper-lined styrofoam container, while the punget tartar did wthat it was supposed to do - offering support, while not trying to steal the spotlight. This perch/tatar combo is a match made in heaven and a marriage that is built to last. Marriage requires a lot of give and take and this about as generous as it gets when your husband is a Fish Fry fanatic.

I say: another Friday, another Fish Fry at the Villa Tap.By now you know that the $14.75 lake perch at the Villa is some of the best fish Madison has to offer despite the fact that it comes ""Tavern Style."" Tavern Style in this case just means it's a bare bones Fry with no real options outside of the fish itself (cod, lake perch, bluegill, or walleye). The real deal lake perch fillets are the fattest Chico can find, and bring their A-game each and every Friday. It's nearly impossible to find a tastier fish in this or any area thanks to the flaky fish and the heavily seasoned breading. The tartar at the Tap is as thick and zesty as any you will find, and clings like crazy. For Tavern Style, this stuff is straight outta the supper club. Freezer fries form a pad for the fish to fall on and are nothing special, beyond the frying mastery the owner applies to them. The rolls are regular (mine was pretty smashed today), and the slaw is standard so both fit the ""this is just a Tavern Style Fish Fry"" mold well. The Villa Tap has been one of our favorites for quite some time now and the fact they put up wait list for people to fill out on Friday nights makes it clear that the rest of Madison is on the same page.

It's just so damn good.Today was a perch day and if you've never had this perch you've missed out on one of life's simple pleasures. It runs just under $15, which you might think is pricey for a tavern, but believe you us, it's worth every damn penny. Chico does perch right and doesn't compromise when it comes to quality. He only gets the genuine article and will take it off the menu before he opts for the cheaper stuff like some places are doing these days.

I love the Villa Tap. If you already knew that heres more of the same. If not, youre in for a treat The classic Villa Tap Fish Fry goes for $14.25 which lets you select from lake perch, bluegill, or walleye. There is also cod available, but with these three options I would literally never go for codever. All things at the Villa begin with the lake perch and Chico lays them out in a teepee of terrificnessor terrificosityor some other form of terrific. These are real deal yellow perch which vary in size according to what is in stock.  They are mostly fat and plush, always flaky, and never greasy. The breading is loaded to the gills with flavor and works as well on the sunfish as it does on the perch. Speaking of the sunfish, they are a little more fishy than their freshwater brethren, but with a breading with so much seasoning the essence is offset nicely.At the VT the focus is on the fish so the fact that freezer fries come with is no big deal. They serve as the straw bed to the cattle, giving the fish a nice place to rest and lending support to ease the load. They are there to comfort and make a space, but not to draw attention. All they need to be is well-fried, and they are every time. Great fish deserves a great tartar and the big, bold blend at the Villa has plenty of sass to balance the overtly seasoned perch and bluegill. Its some of the best youre going to find. Of course, before any of this happens some slaw and roll will come your way. The roll is just a roll, but slaw seems to keep improving incrementally over time. A sesame seed here, and a hint of horseradish there make for a more interesting mix that kicks the diversity quotient up a notch. I do love the Villa Tap, but at this point I only go for lunch. Sometimes its just too busy at night and right now we just cant deal with that. Luckily, the same fish they serve after 4:00 is available for lunch so I never feel left out.

The local watering hole doesnt appear to be anything all that special and a lot of people probably just whiz right by on their way downtown or to the mall. Most days of the week its not a destination for the massesthen Friday rolls around.On Friday their parking lot overflows and chokes the residential streets to the South and West of Packers Avenue. Inside the tiny bar things get cramped and wait times for dinner get long. What could be the cause of all this chaos? Is it just people cutting loose after a long work week? Is it superb happy hour specials? Is it the friendly bartenders that people just cant wait to tip? Well, maybe those things are a part of it, but the Villas Friday Fish Fry special is definitely the catalyst. Eastsiders flock to the bar like mosquitos to a bug zapper and with good reason - Chicos has some of the best fish in the city. Even westsiders seem to come out of the woodwork for the delicious lake perch, walleye, bluegill, and cod. While Chicos claim to fame is the perch, the same breading graces them all so there is a consistency no matter which you choose. The filets are always fried to perfection meaning they are never dried out, or greasy. This is the result of a true fry master at work.The number of fillets vary based on the size in stock, but our recent trip yielded six perfectly-seasoned perch which formed a tantalizing teepee atop a hefty handful of freezer fries. The fries, while not unique, are fried as well as the fish and make for an unassuming accompaniment. Ensuring the fish is all it can be is an idyllic tartar that pushes the nearly perfect perch a tiny bit further up the ladder. The best tartars are thick, creamy and zesty, and thats Chicos mix in a nutshell (although not literally in a nutshell, that would be weird, its in a cup). Of course, no traditional Fish Fry would be complete without some coleslaw and a roll, and the Villas duo come before any of the fried goodies. The roll is as basic as the come, not made in house (its a bar not a bakery), and not unique in any way (it doesnt need to be), but it gets the job done. The slaw is also straightforward, a Sysco standard if ever there was one, but again, it just does what it supposed to do. These are the table setters, the equivalent of the one and two hitters in a lineup, and their job is just to get on base and let the big boppers do what they do. Runs are scored at the Villa, you can bet on that. If a dead horse has ever been beaten, weve taken it to new levels with our love of the lake perch at the Villa. We know it, and we dont care one bit; this stuff is simply outstanding. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and will keep coming back as often as is humanely possible.  www.facebook.com/ChicosVillaTap/?sk=timeline&app_data2302 Packers AvenueMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-9627",2967,0.18792262085740347,0.5340727750510359

You went to the Villa Tap again? Well you dont sayI know, I know, youre getting sick of my non-stop Tapping, but Im sorry to say thats just the way it is. For starters the Villa is (relatively) close to my house which makes getting there in between work and child care extremely convenient. Second, and most importantly, their Fish Fry is awesome and as consistent as they come which makes stopping for a quick bite over lunch an obvious choice for me. Since the lake perch returned to the Villa Ive been gorging myself on it at the expense of the bluegill and the walleye. This Friday I wanted the perch again, but forced myself to order the walleye since I knew it was feeling neglected. All the freshwater fish at the Tap run a smooth $14.50 and come with all the standard sides. No sooner is your placemat set than a cup of Chicos slaw and a basic diner roll are laid upon it. This is the best slaw Ive ever had has never been uttered at the Villa, but then again Im not sure its ever been uttered anywhere. This slaw probably has cabbage and carrot in it, but its coated by enough creamy goodness that you dont even notice the substrate. The dinner roll is white. Nuff said. If fat fillets are your thing than this walleye is what youre after. Its a chunky bugger thats graced by Chicos omnipresent breading. I know Ive said it a million times before but this breading is unabashedly delicious. Its probably loaded with MSG or some other stuff that freaks out the health conscious, but I could really care less about all that. Its the bees knees. A smallish side of fries accompanied the fish this time around and are about as good as you can expect at tiny tavern. Theres nothing special about them other than how well theyre fried. Some thick and zippy tartar sauce perfection rounds things out and kicks the fish up a notch without needed a whole lot of attention of its own. Look, the Villa Tap is simply great and thats just the way it is. Since I have a lot of reasons to go there and little reason to go anywhere else it has become my defacto #1.

Usually $14.50 gets you five fat fillets, but today it was six smaller swimmers. I assume it has to do with the perch shortage we experienced last year, the results being younger, smaller fish, but more of them. Regardless of their stature, they were no less enticing. The supple, flaky meat pairs perfectly with the Villas hallmark breading making for fish of unrivaled delectability. Usually the Villa piles on the fries but the portion today wasnt much more than a handful. They were the same as always  freezer fried perfection  but there were just less of them. The tartar was also the Villa standard and it featured the smooth creaminess that everyone likes. Its big and bold and has enough pop to punch the zesty fish right in its ugly mug. Grandmas basic bun comes before the fish as does Chicos basic slaw. Neither of them leave an impression, but both of them do their job. Kind of likeaaa street sweeper? Yeah, a street sweeper. Thatll do. Its no secret the Villa Tap has some of the best fish in town, and apparently Madison has gotten wise to it. The tiny bar, and their tiny parking lot overflow on Friday nights resulting in long waits and a dog-eat dog (or fish-eat-fish as it were) mentality. For this reason I usually come in for lunch when the same fish is one the menu but the seating is much more available. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and find that its basically our default at this point.

I repeat, LAKE PERCH IS BACK AT CHICOS VILLA TAP! Go get it right now. Eat it up as fast as you can. Thank me later.I really couldnt be happier that suppliers are once again able to meet Wisconsins insatiable appetite for the most traditional of Fish Fry fish. It has been far too long since Chico was able to get it in stock and I can only hope there isnt a repeat of this in scenario in years to come. Its been a difficult few months. Simply devastating to be honest. Chicos lake perch aint cheap, but I also dont really care. Ill gladly pay $14.50 for anything that tastes this good. The Canadian critters are flaky and supple, and carefully coated in Chicos signature breading. This stuff is simply amazing, and tastes like KFCs secret recipe on steroids. Its so flavorful that Im sure theres no way it can be good for you, but then again, I dont really care. Im drooling just thinking about it.  Nothing else in this Fish Fry is on the same level as the fish, although they are all they can be  starting with the French fries. Chicos fries come straight out of a big brown bag from the freezer and while the skin-on spuds are nothing special in that regard, they are as well-fried and as well-salted as can be. The fry master shows his skill here. There is just something about homemade tartar that makes it stand out and Chicos blend is thick and pungent. It stands up to the fish as well as any sauce could. The dinner roll at the Villa is nothing special, but why should it be? This isnt a bakery after all. Likewise, the slaw just kind of does its thing although it does seem to be getting incrementally better over time. Ive said it before and Ill say it again, the lake perch at the Villa Tap is in the running for the single tastiest fish available in Madison. Its just incredibly delicious and I couldnt care less what exactly makes it so. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and couldnt be happier to see the perch return to the Tap. iViva la Villa! www.facebook.com/ChicosVillaTap/?sk=timeline&app_data2302 Packers AvenueMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-9627",2134,0.1805094130675526,0.5171723883351791

When the lake perch is unavailable you want walleye. When it gets to the point where even the walleye is unavailable you have to settle for cod, or do you? Since the main freshwater options are all out, Chico has put bluegill on the menu, and rumor has it that it will be sticking around even after the perch and walleye return. Now thats fresh!Regardless of what it covers, the Villas breading is incredible. It makes perch perfect, walleye wonderful, and the bluegill beautiful. 10 or so bountiful fillets vary in size, but are consistently delectable. They are oh so flaky, oh so smooth, and oh so delicious. Bluegill can get fishy tasting and rubbery, but not this stuff; its a delight to eat and sure to please. Fry master Chico turns freezer fodder into gastro gold and where a big brown bag a fries might be some cooks downfall it only emphasizes his talents. The spuds are perfectly salted and satisfyingly crisp making for a fine accompaniment for the saucy fish. And while were on saucy stuff, check out Chicos thick and zesty tartar. Its as good as it gets. The Villas slaw is the basic creamy variety, and the dinner roll is just a roll, but theyre just role players (no pun intended) and do exactly what they should and nothing more. While we cant wait for the perch to return to the plates at the Villa, the bluegill is filling in for its friend quite admirably. While the fillets are smaller, there are a lot more of them to love which actually increases the fish:breading ratio. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and are glad to hear that its going to stick around.

Sure, its dark, the ceilings are low, it smells like a bar, and when it gets busy it feels cramped, but thats what makes it so great. Well, all of that and some of the tastiest Fish Fry this state has ever known. The Villa never changes nor does its Canadian Lake Perch, and thank God for that. This perch is simply outstanding and some of the best you will ever taste, I promise you. The fillets are big and meaty  incredibly hearty for perch  and home to the most flavorful breading the word has ever known. When the sweet perch meets the immaculately seasoned breading a purely amazing flavor combination is achieved that just makes you want more and more. It fills the belly and soothes the soul with love. Delicious fishy love. Everything else at the Villa is pretty basic except for the tartar which is zesty and creamy, and a step above the norm. The fries are just fries, but expertly fried with enough salt to make them tasty. The dinner roll is essentially what youd find if you Googled dinner roll, and the slaw is the standard creamy and peppy mix. Its all pretty average, but is solely there to lend support to the perch and thats exactly what it does.The goal of any Fish Fry is to have the tastiest fish possible. Sure, fancy potatoes, unique bread options, and eclectic atmospheres are nice, but in the end its all about the fish and the Villa does it better than anywhere else. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and will never stop coming back. Never ever ever.

The Fish Fry is delicious and thats that. Whether you order the lake perch, the walleye or (god forbid) the cod, some slaw and a dinner roll will come your way beforehand. Dont get me wrong the cod is fine, but the perch and walleye are sinfully delicious and not to be missed while the cod is just kind of cod. The slaw will be the standard stuff but with a little more pep than the usual, and the roll will just be a roll thats every bit of ordinary. Depending on when you show up youll get your fish in a jif. If youre like me youll chose the lake perch and youll consistently be amazed. The fish is deliciously moist and incredibly meaty with a mild flavor thats completely devoid of any fishy flavors. Its paired with the best breading around which encases the top quality fillets with love. The resulting taste combination is pure chomping enjoyment and arguably the most flavorful fish you will ever eat; Im not even kidding. Some skin-on freezer fries will accompany the pristine perch and portray plainness but also show in size. Yeah, theyre ordinary, but there are lots of them to love and when good fries come in an excellent portion greatness still ensues. The Villa figured out tartar a few years ago with a thick and creamy concoction that was as good as any supper club sauce. Recently its been altered and a thinner mix with slightly less zest has taken its place. While its still rich and flavorful its not the clinger of days past. Its a change for the worse to be sure, but the fish is so good its not really a big deal at all.  The Villa Tap is a tiny bar that has one of the biggest Fish Frys around. It is really a great little place and clearly one of our go-to spots. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and will keep coming back until they give us a reason not to. www.facebook.com/ChicosVillaTap/?sk=timeline&app_data2302 Packers AvenueMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-9627",1970,0.26684807256235826,0.508425925925926

I needed tasty. I needed the Villa Tap.If you show up at the Villa at 11:00 you are pretty much guaranteed a quick in and out, and thats exactly what I got.The perch flew out of the fryer and landed at my booth about five minutes after I got there. The five fillets were thick and meaty with a flaky texture and the Villas signature breading. The crust was crispy, ultra-flavorful, and smothered the moist perch in the best of ways. A bounty of skin-on freezer fries made a comfy cradle for the perch with their well-fried exteriors and plush innards. Almost like a water bed, the snappy fries kept the fish afloat lending gentle support and a palate cleansing crunch.An A+ tartar starred along with the perch with the right mayo:relish ratio. Its pop paired perfectly with spicy breading producing a flavor combo you dont find every day. Some standard slaw and a regular roll were the definition of basic, but did what theyre supposed to do by setting the stage without stealing the show. If quick and tasty is your thing give the Tap a whirl during the lunch hour. If you prefer to take your time in a lively atmosphere hit the Tap for dinner. But either way, if you love Fish Fry get over to the Villa Tap, youll be happy you did (I always am).

The bar itself is a typical dive, not bad, but certainly not special. The beer selection is decent, but also nothing particularly special. The food is your basic bar food, and probably not something most people would consider special. But, there is at least one special thing about the Villa Tap, and we know exactly what it is. Its the Friday Fish Fry!The lake perch at the Villa Tap is really something special and arguably the tastiest fried fish the world has ever known. It all starts with fat, meaty fillets of Canadian Lake Perch which the owner/frymaster, Chico, dredges through his souped-up seasoning. He then fries them for just the right amount of time in scalding hot oil which makes the breading crispy and the fish supple yet flaky. The resultant taste is nothing short of miraculous blending the subtle sweetness of the fish with the in-your-face spiciness of the breading. The rest of the items that surround the fish are fairly standard, save for the tartar sauce. The sauce is a thick a zippy rendition that complements the fish quite well. While a wimpier sauce would be lost in the shuffle, this mix has plenty of punch to keep the perch in check. The fries are basic freezer fries although they do have the skins on. If nothing else there are plenty of them on the plate which ensures they last until the fish is gone. A regular roll and a some standard slaw round out this Fish Fry and do what they need to do but not much else. In our opinion the Villa Tap is a great place that becomes truly special when Friday rolls around. The lake perch is just too delicious too pass up and even though you dont get a lot else for your $14.50 the perch is so good that it really doesnt matter. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and will come back anytime were feeling special. www.facebook.com/ChicosVillaTap/?sk=timeline&app_data2302 Packers AvenueMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-9627",2025,0.15519305019305019,0.4132630432630432

While the fish at the Villa isnt cheap its so tasty that I really dont care how much it costs. Its Tavern Style so you expect simplicity and simple is exactly what you get. While the fish is busy frying there is some coleslaw and a dinner roll to pass the time. The slaw is zesty, although a bit heavy on the caraway seeds (at least I think theyre caraway although Im no seed expert, all I know is they get stuck in my teeth like a sumbitch). The roll is the most basic you will find, but at least its present which you dont always find at the more informal Frys. If Chico isnt too busy behind the fryer your fish will come in a flash (mine always does). The plate will arrive piled high with five fat perch laid lovingly over a battalion of fries. These are some of the moistest perch on the planet and come coated in a mouthwatering (some would say KFC-like) breading that really does the job. Its a flavor combo I simply cant get enough of. The Villa is a small bar with a small kitchen (if you can even call it that). Since theres no room for a bunch of fancy prep the potato options are limited to fries or baked. While the baked has eluded me (I assume its fairly standard) the freezer fries havent, and play their part well. The key to these spuds is that they are fried for just the right amount of time and salted while still glistening.  A big, thick, creamy tartar stands toe-to-toe with the ultra-seasoned fish and doesnt back down a bit. Its a real powerhouse of a sauce and even though its not necessarily needed it makes the fish shine even brighter when applied. The Villa Tap is an itty-bitty tavern that some would call dark and dingy. While that might be a problem for them it suits me just fine since I grew up with these kinds of places and have grown to appreciate their unique character (and characters). It has a small-town feel but is right in the city I know and love. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and think its one of the best Madison has to offer at any price. www.facebook.com/ChicosVillaTap/?sk=timeline&app_data2302 Packers AvenueMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-9627",2257,0.09892953929539296,0.42676732481610535

For years weve steadfastly stood by them despite the fact that the price of their Fish Fry has gone up and up. The perch and walleye currently sit around the fifteen dollar mark which is a bit too rich for some peoples blood. It isnt always easy justifying a fifteen dollar lunch, but when the fish tastes this good sometimes you just do what you gotta do.While the Villa is always packed at dinner time, lunch is much more accessible so we usually go then. Before the fish some slaw and a basic dinner roll hit the table. The slaw has improved over the years and is a good mix but definitely not the best youll find, although it is creamy and looks to be homemade. The roll is just a roll, but usually soft and fresh since theyre likely delivered on Friday morning. With the slaw and roll formalities out of the way its onto the real reason for coming to the Villa  the fish. As per usual we got the lake perch and as per usual it was superb. The five fat pieces featured the Villas spicy breading which has a ton of flavor that makes the smooth perch really stand out. It pairs perfectly with the Villas thick and creamy tartar. We have it on good authority that Chico gets his grub from Reinhart Foodservice and while Reinharts freezer fries are nothing special, they get the job done. Of course, it doesnt hurt that Chico knows how to fry them just right  not too crispy, but also not limp. When the price of the perch at the Villa Tap went from $12.00 to $12.50 we barely batted and eyelash; when it got bumped up to $13.00 we started to take notice; and when it made the leap to a full $14.50 our ears (and taste buds) perked up. Fifteen bucks is about the top of the mark when it comes to Fish Fry, especially considering that nothing at the Villa is all that special except for the actual fish. Luckily for Chico, fish is the most important component of any Fish Fry so we cant help but continue to give him the benefit of the doubt. Overall, we still highly recommend this Fish Fry but only because the fish is just so damn delicious. www.facebook.com/ChicosVillaTap/?sk=timeline&app_data2302 Packers AvenueMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-9627",2233,0.2847967479674797,0.5404936120789778

If you want tasty, unpretentious food, you want the Villa Tap. If you want reasonably priced drinks including hand-muddled Old Fashioneds, you want the Villa Tap. If you want hell, it doesnt matter what you want, you want the Villa Tap. This Friday I wanted walleye and the first place I thought of was the Villa. I swung in just after 12:00, found myself a spot at the bar and had my order in and a pint of Spotted Cow in front of me in no time. Not a minute later my slaw and roll showed up, looking as appetizing as ever. Try though I might, I could not resist the allure of the slaw and despite my attempt to wait for the fish I wound up digging in prematurely. The slaw was cool and creamy with plenty of punch to quell its robust cabbage core. My will prevailed with the regular roll however, and it sat idly by as I waited for King Wally to hold court. The fish was ready about 10 minutes later, and as served lickety-split; plumes of steam rising from its glistening surface. As expected the Lord of the Land was a massive beast  perhaps the largest to ever grace us with his presence. The fillet was thick as can be, approaching a full two inches at his meaty middle. He wore a cloak of the finest breading that was light to the touch with enough seasoning to enhance his ample innards. He was a compassionate monarch, gracing us with his moist and flaky bounty, and asking little in return. All Hail, King Wally! Reign forever.Sitting at the side of the king was a princely portion of freezer fries, fresh from the brown Sysco sack. They were just the same old same old, but at least they were well-fried, and plentiful enough to serve the sultan until the end. Chicos creamy tartar also lent its full support to his highness, with a great zip that perfectly complemented the meaty fish. The sublime sauce somehow held its own next to the magnate despite his spicy skin and larger-than-life presence. If you want a great Fish Fry, you want the Villa Tap, and whether its lake perch or walleye you will get the best that money can buy. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry, and cant say enough good things about Chicos fish. Its simply the best. iViva la Villa y Viva King Wally! www.facebook.com/ChicosVillaTap/?sk=timeline&app_data2302 Packers AvenueMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-9627",2369,0.20480729166666664,0.40372664835164834

You go there a whole bunch of times, and of course, you do so with good reason  they have an amazing Fish Fry. Then you take some time off, you go to other Fish Frys, and you forget exactly what it is that made you go to the Villa Tap so many times to begin with. Eventually you find yourself at the Villa again and it all comes rushing back. The Fish Fry at the Villa Tap really is something special, and its mostly due to the superb lake perch. The perch plate runs a full $15, and while that may seem like a lot of dough for a meal from a bar, the price is actually quite justified. Depending on how busy Chico is your perch will arrive in somewhere between five and forty-five minutes after you order (five on the lunch side, and forty-five during the dinner rush). But regardless of how long you wait you will be rewarded for you patience. Its difficult to describe how good the perch at the Villa really is, and when you havent had it for a while you forget that it really is this good. The fillets are fat. In fact, they are some of the thickest and moistest you will find. The plump perch are then covered in what is assuredly the most flavorful breading imaginable. The five fat pieces result in a princely portion of superbly-seasoned morels that dance on your tongue and tickle your taste buds. It is lip-smacking, finger-licking good, and Im not sure how it could even be improved upon. It is, in a (made up) word, perchfection. From there things take a step-back, but dont totally fall off by any means. The fries come from the freezer, but do so with their skin on. The Julienne-cut spuds are well-fried, and appropriately salted to achieve their maximum potential. They are tasty enough and add the right element to the Fish Fry without overshadowing the prized perch. The perch is so great that it can be eaten as-is, but the Tap tartar gives it a little boost if youre into that sort of thing. Its a thick and creamy mix that is almost entirely mayo, but has just enough relish to let you know its there. The slaw is also there, and while its not the best ever, it certainly holds its own. Its a creamy, diverse rendition that has a fresh cabbage flavor. The bread comes along with the slaw before the fish is served and is essentially just your basic dinner roll. When you go out for Fish Fry every Friday they sort of all blend together and you tend to forget what makes the truly special ones special. Then you go back to somewhere like the Villa Tap and it hits you like a ton of bricks. Amazing fish makes the Fry, and the Tap has it and then some.

In fact, they are some of the thickest and moistest you will find. The plump perch are then covered in what is assuredly the most flavorful breading imaginable. The five fat pieces result in a princely portion of superbly-seasoned morels that dance on your tongue and tickle your taste buds. It is lip-smacking, finger-licking good, and Im not sure how it could even be improved upon. It is, in a (made up) word, perchfection. From there things take a step-back, but dont totally fall off by any means. The fries come from the freezer, but do so with their skin on. The Julienne-cut spuds are well-fried, and appropriately salted to achieve their maximum potential. They are tasty enough and add the right element to the Fish Fry without overshadowing the prized perch. The perch is so great that it can be eaten as-is, but the Tap tartar gives it a little boost if youre into that sort of thing. Its a thick and creamy mix that is almost entirely mayo, but has just enough relish to let you know its there. The slaw is also there, and while its not the best ever, it certainly holds its own. Its a creamy, diverse rendition that has a fresh cabbage flavor. The bread comes along with the slaw before the fish is served and is essentially just your basic dinner roll. When you go out for Fish Fry every Friday they sort of all blend together and you tend to forget what makes the truly special ones special. Then you go back to somewhere like the Villa Tap and it hits you like a ton of bricks. Amazing fish makes the Fry, and the Tap has it and then some. Overall, we highly recommend the lake perch at the Villa Tap and will be rushing back in soon.

While the inconspicuous dive bar used to be a well-kept secret their fabulous fish has transformed them into a city-wide phenomenon, making a dinnertime Fish Fry a difficult proposition. For those not wanting to fight the crowds (or take the chance on the perch and walleye being sold out) The Tap does fish for lunch, although at $14.50 its not exactly an economical noon hour nibble.Thats right, you heard that correctly. Due to immense popularity the Villa has bumped the price of their perch up to fourteen dollars and fifty cents. Thats a full $2 more than the previous price, and although I did feel some sticker shock, I went with it because, what am I gonna do? Go somewhere else? Yeah right... Other than a pint of Spotted Cow the first thing to hit the bar in front of me was some slaw and a dinner roll. The roll was the same-old-same-old (complete with a pat of fridge-fresh butter), but the slaw was something better. The creamy blend was really tasty and very colorful. It had plenty of pop and a pretty diverse flavor for coleslaw. Not long after I polished off the sassy slaw and basic bun the fish showed its face. As per usual, the plate featured five fat perch, some freezer fries, a cup of tartar, and a fresh chunk of lemon (for those who swing that way). It looked just right, so I wasted no time and popped the lid on the tartar, grabbed a fillet, and went to town. The meaty perch was, as expected, outstanding. The moist fillets were enrobed in the Villas benevolent breading which was perfectly spiced. The coating boasted plenty of seasoning, but was neither too salty, nor too wimpy. It had a nice consistency and a slight crispiness that contrasted well with the succulent fish. For $14.50 youd like to see a little more effort put forth in the potato department, but Chico has his feet firmly planted in the baked/French realm. While the fries are good (baked not available at lunch), I didnt get many of them, and even those were slightly over-fried. In general, they are some of the better freezer fries out there, but with such a hefty price tag they dont make you feel like youre getting you monies worth. The tartar comes in one of the small Solo cups, and while the fish didnt need it, I still used every last drop. The sultry sauce is creamy and hearty, and has enough zip to stand up to the flavorful fish. It really is an enchanting blend, but like the fries, maybe I could get an extra dollop or two? You know Madison Fish Fry loves the Villa Tap and weve been one of the biggest supporters of their Fish Fry, but things might be getting out of hand here. While we always had a few reservations about dropping $12.50 on a plate of their perch, we have even more at $14.50. Sure, we have paid more for fish, but thats usually an All You Can Eat, an All You Should Eat, or something else where the portions are huge or the establishment justifies it. Dont get me wrong, the Villa is a fun little bar and the fish is still great, but well definitely have to think twice before just popping in now that well need to drop a cool $20 for a beer and some grub. Overall, we still highly recommend this Fish Fry, but think it might be getting too big for its britches. www.facebook.com/ChicosVillaTap/?sk=timeline&app_data2302 Packers AvenueMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-9627",3413,0.13153786104605775,0.4790606297163674

I showed up, grabbed a beer, scored a stool at the packed bar, ordered some fish, and got out of there while the getting was good. It was Friday so it was a little busier than normal, but it wasnt anything I couldnt handle, and Chicos stellar lake perch was more than worth the trouble.Since it was pretty busy I had to wait a few minutes to get a stool, but when I did it was right next to one of the Villa regulars named Denny. Denny was a heck of nice guy, and the 30 minutes or so it took to get my fish flew by as we BSd about Jonny Football dominating the Cotton Bowl and what would surely be the domination of the Vikings by our beloved Packers the following Sunday. Our banter paused incrementally which allowed me sufficient time to enjoy my dinner roll, and the standard creamy coleslaw that arrives before the fish. When the fish did show up the banter mostly died off as my focus shifted squarely to the fried feast and Denny all of a sudden seemed much less interesting. As per usual the perch was superb. While Ive come to expect a delicious KFC-like breading on the moist fillets, this rendition was a little unique, and a little more flavorful. It was spicy and sweet, and seemed to be twice as thick as usual. While the breading was bordering on seasoning-overload, the fish itself was beefy enough to withstand the onslaught - although Im not sure how much more it could have taken. It was a spicy offensive, but the flavors were still balanced, even if the scale was stating to tilt.The Villa fries are the standard freezer-to-fryer numbers and while they are nothing special they are fried to perfection by Fry-master Chico. While the spuds wont necessarily make you stand up and take notice, they do what they are supposed to do in support of the perch. Chicos tartar lends even more aide to the fish, delivering a zesty blast that offsets the spicy perch to perfection. The correct mayo:relish ratio is in effect at the Tap, and the super sauce really takes the powerful perch to a whole new level of excellence. I try not to make too big a deal out of the Villa Tap, but that is getting harder and harder to do. Their Fish Fry is becoming well-known and Friday nights are growing ever-busier to the point where there is now a wait list most of the time. Still, every time I go it is a very low-key experience, the service is quick and friendly, and the fish is simply out of this world. Overall, I highly recommend this Fish Fry and think it is easily one of Madisons finest. FISH ON, Chico!

Take friends to the Villa Tap. Take family members to the Villa Tap. It doesnt really matter who you take to the Villa Tap, just take em. Take em!Ever since we first had the pleasure to sample the lake perch at the Villa Tap we were hooked. It is simply delicious and easily one of our all-time favorites. When Chico recently added walleye to his arsenal the waters got cloudier as a new contender for the best fish in Madison emerged. If youre lucky enough to find yourself at the Villa when its not too busy youll get your fish about 10 minutes after you order it. In the interim youll be treated to a basic dinner roll and some surprisingly good slaw. The colorful coleslaw will be sorta creamy, but plenty zesty  a nice little kick in the pants. The roll will just be of the tear-and-go variety. Piping hot fish will arrive in short order, and whether you choose the fabled perch or the wunderkind walleye you are in for a treat. Both fish boast a superbly-seasoned breading and flaky, juice meat. The walleye fillet featured is massive, at least an inch and a half thick on the meaty side, and flawlessly fried throughout. It tears apart perfectly down the seam with the breading intact. Its the best walleye weve had anywhere. Ever. Chico gets some stuff from Sysco (I see the truck in their lot from time to time on my way to or from work), and I wouldnt be at all surprised if the thick, creamy tartar sauce the Villa features is straight out of the silver trailer - Sysco does make some fine products after all. Whatever the case may be, whether its homemade or shipped by semi, its tasty and tops Chicos catch to a T. Fish is king at the Villa Tap so dont be too surprised the Julienne-cut fries are just kind of basic. They still do what they need to do, but the portion size varies at times and they just seem to fade away behind the fish. There is just something special about the fish at the Villa Tap and whether its the walleye or lake perch (or the cod, I guess) you cant do much better. Overall, we highly recommend the Villa Tap and consider it one of our Go-To places at this point. The Villa Tap is what Fish Fry is all about, and that is that. www.facebook.com/ChicosVillaTap/?sk=timeline&app_data2302 Packers AvenueMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-9627",2325,0.23316534066534061,0.5357170157170157

Sure, you could get cod at lunch, and perch in the evening, but neither of them were drawing in the crowds and certainly werent what youd call destination dinners. Things have changed somewhat over the past few years, and with the new owner Chico driving the bus they have taken a better route, and picked up a lot more passengers along the way  us included.A crew of co-workers and I pulled into the Packers Avenue pub just after the noon hour and were greeted by a larger than expected crowd. Since it was busy and we were five-strong we were forced to grab a high-top table in the back room and wait for the waitress to come find us. Luckily, there was another table back there that she was taking care of so it didnt take long for her to realize wed arrived and come over. (Aside: Back in aught-eight when we started coming to the Villa they didnt even have waitresses, and if you found yourself in the back you could sit back there all day and all night without so much as a glace from the bartenders  the addition of waitresses on Fridays marks a significant milestone in the evolution of the Villa). Its pretty evident that the lake perch at the VT is becoming increasingly popular. Every Friday night tickets line the strip atop the fryer to the point where there is actually a hearty wait for fish. For the impulsive eater (like us) there is respite from the madness  perch and walleye are available for lunch now! While there is no break on the price (or the portion for that matter) who really cares? I didnt think twice about it and welcome the opportunity to have some of the best fish around for this early in the day.Pre-perch youll receive some Tap coleslaw and bakery-fresh(ish) bun. The slaw is usually a little runny, but always has a nice zip and does a good job setting the table for the fish. The roll is just a standard white dinner roll, and really nothing special, but hey, nothing special is still better than nothing at all. Our perch plates came about 10 minutes after the slaw and roll, and were screaming hot. As per usual, the fish was simply superb. It was moist and flaky, and featured the Villas signature breading which just cant be beat. It clings effortlessly to the five fat fillets and virtually screams eat me!Claiming the Best Condiment in a Supporting Role was the Villas homemade tartar sauce. Its performances are commonly called thick, zesty, and unpretentious, and today was no exception. The master played its part perfectly, giving its all for the star of the show and asking nothing in return. While the French fries at the Villa havent totally emerged from the freezer, they are pretty much on the precipice. The skin-on spuds are basically as good as you can get for a frozen fry and Chico knows how long to fry them such that they are crispy on the outside, plush on the inside, and dont taste fishy. What can I say? This is one of my favorite Fish Frys and it just keeps getting better. It has really developed over time, becoming more than just great fish with a bunch of so-so stuff around it. Today it constitutes a complete Fish Fry  one that is well worth the price and the drive. Overall, we highly recommend the lake perch at the Villa Tap - it's a meal fit for the Homo sapien in us all. iViva la Villa!www.facebook.com/ChicosVillaTap/?sk=timeline&app_data2302 Packers AvenueMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-9627",3514,0.2537810522810522,0.46317005217005225

These taverns offer cold beer, a friendly ear, and some of the best fried foods you are going to find. Of course, if youre in Wisconsin and food is frying youre going to find fish. If you ask a Fish Fry purist (and believe me they are out there) what kind of fish they expect at a Fish Fry the answer will invariably be lake perch. This makes sense since at one time the perch were locally caught and abundant. However, long gone are these days and the perch of today is mostly trucked in from Canada and other foreign locales. Thats not to say you cant find local lake perch, but youre not going to find them in many restaurants this side of Door County. Thankfully, when done right, even frozen lake perch is amazing and nowhere is this better demonstrated than The Villa Tap on Madison east side.   The Villa Tap is a classic Wisconsin tavern set right in the middle of the states second largest city. Here the ceilings are low, the music is pumping, and the fish is flowing. For $12.50 you will get five large lake perch fillets coated in a thin, flavorful breading that will almost make you forget youre eating fish. The perch will be moist and succulent, clearly of the highest quality and definitely not what youd expect to find at a local tavern. It might actually be the tastiest fish we have ever had  and that is saying something. The fish will be bolstered by a smooth and creamy tartar which will add a little zip to the fish without making you think much about it. Your only potato choice will be between freezer fries and baked, but the fries will be about as good as you can expect. The portion will certainly satisfy, and the spuds will be well-fried so you cant complain too much. After all, youre here for the fish, the rest is just icing on the cake. A cool and crisp coleslaw will keep your interest, but wont thrill. Nor will the plain old white roll, but like we say, this is a bar youre here for the fish, not the amenities. While the Villa Tap isnt classy it oozes the classic Wisconsin atmosphere. It will be dark inside, the ceilings are low, the vibe is mellow but vibrant, and the fish is flowing. It is exactly what a Fish Fry should be - unpretentious, simple, and delicious. Whats more, if you happen to be coming or going to the airport on a Friday it is literally the closest Fish Fry available. Take a chance on the Villa Tap. We promise, this is one youll remember. Inside Tip: Add a shrimp (or two)The walleye at the Villa Tap is also superb, as are the Old Fashioneds which are muddled before your eyes. Whats more, Chico lets you add any number of his delicious fried shrimp to the meal at any point for $2.50 apiece.*The Villa Tap is on Madisons east side.

Wanna score highly with us? Make delicious, finger-licking fish. Thats it, all the rest is really just window dressing. Sure, potato derivatives, tartar sauces, ryes, and slaws can all play an important role, but these are all complementary items and no matter how good they are individually, can never totally overcome a sub-standard fish. Thus, if your fish is out-of-this world delicious the rest can all be crap as far as were concerned (give or take some level of crapiness).The Villa Tap has been making some of the best fish around for some time now, and while they dont have a fancy-schmancy salad bar or view of a lake, they buy quality fish and know how to fry it. Needless to say, they score highly with us. We have noticed an uptick in business at Chez Villa since we started touting their perfectly seasoned lake perch a few years back, but tonight things were calmer, the music lower, the bartenders more chatty. Our group was to come from all corners of the city and descended on Packers Avenue establishment around 7. The first four of us made it on time, bellied-up, and put down a nice liquid base for the fish swim around in. 40 minutes or so later, our quartet was overwhelmed by the smell of fried goods that tickled our nostrils ever so mockingly. We could wait no more (the apps we ordered, while adequate, not sufficient), and called the tardy party let them know we were diving in without them (they would get theirs later). We took the table by the fryer, ordered our perch, and waited, bellies trembling with anticipation. Four rounds of fish took no time for Chico to fry and were served to us in pristine condition. As per usual, the flaky and meaty fillets paired perfectly with the Villas spicy breading, and the greaseless wonders were consumed effortlessly. It was simply stupendous stuff and you just can't argue with it. Again this trip, a noob in our party was overheard saying it was the best fish they had ever had. Score yet another one for the Villa. As outlined above, when the fish is this good you could give me some day old McDonalds fries and I would probably be happy. The Villa fries were just fine, not homemade or anything fancy, but certainly nothing to complain about. Also when the fish is this good, it need not be burdened with too much tartar sauce since tartar is more of a mask than a complementary flavor most of the time. The Villa sauce is pretty much everything you could ask for in this situation - nothing fancy, nothing out of the ordinary  just a good solid sauce to complement the occasional bite of fish.As far as tradition goes, rye bread should accompany a Fish Fry. Over the years I have begun to enjoy the character rye bread adds to the meal and was pleased to see that Chico has included a slice or two to the bread basket. While we arent tied to tradition all the time we do appreciate the effort to keep it going and will give a bump up for that. Lets be honest, the fish is what makes or breaks a Fish Fry. Potato pancakes and relish trays are nice upgrades to the meal, and if youre looking for all the little add-ons this might not be the Fish Fry for you. However, if you are like us, and prize the perfectly fried fish and sides that are there, but not a distraction, the Villa has you covered. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and will each and every time we are lucky enough to get our hands on it.iViva la Villa! iViva! www.facebook.com/ChicosVillaTap/?sk=timeline&app_data2302 Packers AvenueMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-9627",3561,0.2585011138958506,0.5491464773043722

The two of us sat right and the bar, got a pitcher of beer, and put our orders in for fish as soon as the friendly bartender got done introducing the options to us. We all know that the lake perch at the Villa Tap is some of the best fried fish on the face of Gods green Earth, but Chico recently added walleye to the entourage, and we just had to give it a whirl. Before the freshwater duo would make its way to us, we were treated to the Villa Taps standard coleslaw and dinner roll combo, which is the same as it ever was  the slaw creamy, and the roll roll-y. No change from Chico on this front.Our $12.50 platters arrived shortly thereafter and were piping hot. I wasted no time and tore into my large walleye fillet with both hands. Like the perch weve come to know and love the walleye was simply superb. Not only was the fish itself thick and meaty, but it sported the same ultra-flavorful breading as its aquatic brethren. The resulting flavor combo was out of this world, with moist, flaky fish, pairing flawlessly with the KFC-like coating. It was so good that it practically flew off my plate, leaving me (and the bartender) wondering exactly what happened. It was glorious. Jer offered up a piece of the perch, which I of course pounced on. While the walleye was nothing less than spectacular I would have to say the perch was still a little better (which is really saying something). It was exactly what we have come to expect from The Tap and we were pleased to see that Chico hasnt tried to up the ante. I mean, what could he even do? The fish is damn-near perfect as is.While the fish conformed to standard set by the previous owner the Julienne-cut fries were a departure from what we have come to expect  but in a good way. These new skin-on spuds were better than the crinkles of old, but while the taste was improved the portion was downsized to an adequate number rather than an alarming amount. In this case, Chico chose quality over quantity, which is six of one, half dozen of the other in our book.Apparently this book of Fish Fry has gotten around and the updates at the VT reflect that fact. The Tap sauce of old was a pungent blend, with a much larger than average portion of relish. Chico has scaled the relish quotient back some and placed a new, thicker, mayo-heavy tartar in its place. This new breed was just about perfect, fully complementing the fine fish and making it something more than just fired slab. Simply superb.What can we say? This was another amazing experience at the Villa Tap, made all the more enjoyable when compared to the shoddy treatment we received prior to it. The fish is above reproach; whether you pick the perch, or are in want of some walleye, you cant go wrong.  One thing we did notice is that the bar seemed unusually empty for 7:30 on a Friday, but we assume it has to do with the ownership change and the fact that some of the old regulars probably moved on. Oh well, its no skin off our nose as long as they stay the course on Friday and keep serving that fantastic fish. Overall, we cannot recommend this Fish Fry highly enough, and who knows? If the old regulars have moved out maybe its time for MFF to move in? Wed at least have one of the best Fish Frys in Madison each and every Friday and some friendly folks to serve it up, we know that much. iViva la Chico!www.facebook.com/ChicosVillaTap/?sk=timeline&app_data2302 Packers AvenueMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-9627",3956,0.18270884520884517,0.4576700889200888

Before the freshwater duo would make its way to us, we were treated to the Villa Taps standard coleslaw and dinner roll combo, which is the same as it ever was  the slaw creamy, and the roll roll-y. No change from Chico on this front.Our $12.50 platters arrived shortly thereafter and were piping hot. I wasted no time and tore into my large walleye fillet with both hands. Like the perch weve come to know and love the walleye was simply superb. Not only was the fish itself thick and meaty, but it sported the same ultra-flavorful breading as its aquatic brethren. The resulting flavor combo was out of this world, with moist, flaky fish, pairing flawlessly with the KFC-like coating. It was so good that it practically flew off my plate, leaving me (and the bartender) wondering exactly what happened. It was glorious. Jer offered up a piece of the perch, which I of course pounced on. While the walleye was nothing less than spectacular I would have to say the perch was still a little better (which is really saying something). It was exactly what we have come to expect from The Tap and we were pleased to see that Chico hasnt tried to up the ante. I mean, what could he even do? The fish is damn-near perfect as is.While the fish conformed to standard set by the previous owner the Julienne-cut fries were a departure from what we have come to expect  but in a good way. These new skin-on spuds were better than the crinkles of old, but while the taste was improved the portion was downsized to an adequate number rather than an alarming amount. In this case, Chico chose quality over quantity, which is six of one, half dozen of the other in our book.Apparently this book of Fish Fry has gotten around and the updates at the VT reflect that fact. The Tap sauce of old was a pungent blend, with a much larger than average portion of relish. Chico has scaled the relish quotient back some and placed a new, thicker, mayo-heavy tartar in its place. This new breed was just about perfect, fully complementing the fine fish and making it something more than just fired slab. Simply superb.What can we say? This was another amazing experience at the Villa Tap, made all the more enjoyable when compared to the shoddy treatment we received prior to it. The fish is above reproach; whether you pick the perch, or are in want of some walleye, you cant go wrong.  One thing we did notice is that the bar seemed unusually empty for 7:30 on a Friday, but we assume it has to do with the ownership change and the fact that some of the old regulars probably moved on. Oh well, its no skin off our nose as long as they stay the course on Friday and keep serving that fantastic fish. Overall, we cannot recommend this Fish Fry highly enough, and who knows? If the old regulars have moved out maybe its time for MFF to move in? Wed at least have one of the best Fish Frys in Madison each and every Friday and some friendly folks to serve it up, we know that much. iViva la Chico!www.facebook.com/ChicosVillaTap/?sk=timeline&app_data2302 Packers AvenueMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-9627",3956,0.18270884520884517,0.4576700889200888

Well, not exactly. More like came for a visit, but when Gabe made an appearance in Madtown you know there was only one thing in his mind, the Canadian lake perch at the Villa Tap.Honestly, there may not be a single tastier option in the area than the fantastic freshwater fish that surface Friday at the Villa. For $12.50 youll find five fat fillets, a family of French fries, and ferocious tartar on your plate. A regular roll and some standard slaw will arrive beforehand and set the stage nicely for the stars of the show. We barely even had a chance to get a glass of the pitcher and enjoy the neighborhood bar atmosphere before the slaw and roll hit the table. The roll was nothing special, but was soft and about as fresh as you can expect to get at a real bar. The slaw also hovered around the norm and could have used a little more zest. That said, both served their duty admirably, and left us longing for the perch just as they are supposed to do. The phenomenal fish arrived within 10 minutes of our initial order, freshly fried and as hot as can be. The perfect perch was moist and flaky, and boasted the tastiest breading we have ever come across. It is easily some of, if not the, best fish we have ever had, and is almost too delicious for description. The balance of spice and delicate fish dances on the palate and leaves you awestruck, as if to say I didnt think any fish could be this good. In fact, I know a few people who have uttered that exact phrase.Pairing with the perch on my plate were the wonderful wedge fries that I selected over the Villas regular or sweet potato options. The chunky wedges were simply dynamite with their crispy, spicy, coating and supple interiors. They easily relegated the regular fries to obscurity and even surpassed the sweet potatoes option which were well fried and dawned a flaky coating that is no easy task achieve when it comes to the yam-fam. Polishing off the platter was the homemade Tap tartar which seemed to be little lighter on the relish to me, but everyone else seemed to think it was as potent as ever. Either way, the creamy wonder worked the perch hard and improved it ever so slightly, even though this perch can go tartar-free with ease. This was another simply outstanding trip to the Villa Tap, and we highly recommend this Fish Fry especially if you are a lover of lake perch and/or local taverns. The fish itself is without a dount some of the best you will ever taste, the wedges made an immediate impression, and the tartar took it over the top. Add the grocery store fresh roll, and satisfying slaw and you get a fairly good value even at twelve and a half bucks. We will be back time and again to enjoy the great atmosphere, the good people and the fantastic fish at the Villa Tap. We recommend you do the same.iViva la Villa! iViva!www.facebook.com/ChicosVillaTap/?sk=timeline&app_data2302 Packers AvenueMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-9627",2956,0.25992207792207794,0.5029750249750251

Our nations economy is in the crapper, yet we keep buying things made in China - hard to believe. Brittany Spears has been making music for over 10 years now and somehow manages to keep doing so - hard to believe. An oil spill of epic proportions is currently under way with no solution coming for days, and possibly months  hard to believe. While these unfortunate facts may be outside the realm of what people consider logical, they are no less real, which makes them all the more frustrating to think about. It is easier instead to turn our thoughts to Fish Fry, but even then, there are exceptions to the unwritten, piscine rules. For example, the Villa Tap, has some of, if not the, best lake perch in the city. I know it is hard to believe, but it is oh so true and oh so delicious.For most Fish Fry eaters dive bars like the Villa Tap are not the first kind of places to come to mind when they think about a great meal. The savvy Fish Fry veteran knows better and whenever we are in a hurry and need to get some quick fish the Villa Tap comes to the forefront of our brains. Their Tavern Fish Fry is a no-nonsense affair and is always fast if you dont have a lot of time to spend eating dinner. Since Jer happened to be in a hurry (and had never tried the Villa), I figured what the hell and away we went. The Villa is a tiny place and the clientele is eclectic, but dont let that deter you; the folks within are friendly and the fish is well worth any misgivings you may have. We headed right into the dimly lit pub and found a spot, in the corner nearest the fryer. The lake perch special is served after 4pm and for your $12.50 you receive the standard Friday fair: a decent portion of perch, a stack of fries, some homemade tartar, a packaged dinner roll and some slaw. The slaw and roll hit the table prior to the fish and concurrently with our pitcher of Spotted Cow. The beer was cold and crisp as was the coleslaw which could well have been Sysco, but I didnt really care. It was still pretty tasty and was probably a little better than the standard dinner roll. While some people might be a little put off by this average fare, it is basically exactly what I expect at a Fish Fry. After all, they are the supporting cast, the fish is the star of the show, and this star shines.The VIP was ready for its close up about 10 minutes or so after we ordered and was handed to us directly by the cook. The plate was comprised of a mountain of fries, a mid-sized cup of tartar sauce, and the five decent sized perch fillets,  no BS here. Wasting no time I pawed a piece of perch and plunged it into the ultra-relishy tartar. As always the perch was sublime. The fillets, while not huge, were still nice and meaty. The fish itself was moist and flaky, and wrapped in a thin, almost translucent breading. This divine coating combined with the perch to create a taste sensation that is completely devoid of any fishy taste. It was truly superb and could easily be eaten with or without the tartar.This tartar had a thick mayo base, but what was most noticeable was the generous proportion of relish. While this pungent brew might overwhelm a more meager fish, the Villa Tap perch has such a kick of its own that even the strongest of tartars dare not challenge it. While Jer said he could take the sauce or leave it, I thought the perch and tartar melded to produce a taste greater than the sum of its parts. Last, but certainly not least, were the pile of fries that flanked the fish. These tantalizing tubers were straight-cut and perfectly fried resulting in super crispy exteriors and tender interiors. They more than outlasted the fish as a couple of Jers even went to waste. What can I say? I couldnt finish them for him since I was already full on fish and had more than my share of the Cow to put away.There is at least one quintessential Wisconsin tavern right here in Madison - hard to believe, I know, but the proof is in the pudding (or the perch in this case). I have only been to the Villa Tap six times, but for some reason it feels like a lot more than that. Maybe it is the wood paneling, or the kick ass music that always seems to be on that makes the Villa feel so familiar? Whatever it is we are turning into Tap-heads. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry even at $12.50. The fish is out of this world, the sides all do their part and the tavern atmosphere is everything it is supposed to be. If you love Fish Fry, youll love the Villa Tap. If you love Brittany Spears on the other hand, this might not be the Fish Fry for you... then again, Fish Fry is probably not right for you in general. iViva la Villa!www.facebook.com/ChicosVillaTap/?sk=timeline&app_data2302 Packers AvenueMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-9627",4811,0.14455357142857148,0.512426948051948

It took somewhere around 6 days and along with all the terrestrial and heavenly gobbledygook God also took the time to create mankind. Once man was around God knew he needed to create some things to keep him content. I happen to believe this desire to make mankind happy led to the creation of the two greatest things we as humans have come to know  Fish Fry and Ice Hockey.We had plans to attend the famous St. Peters Catholic School Fish Fry as there was one going on for the first time since last spring. Unfortunately the Lord can be mysterious and blessed us with free Madison Ice Muskies tickets on the same day. Oh, cruel fate! Since I knew the divine spirits would want us to have Fish Fry AND hockey, not just one or the other, I decided we would forgo the trip to the church and have a quick and dirty Fry on our way to Hartmeyer where the Muskies would be in action. Gabe and I saddled up and headed to the Villa Tap since it is only a stones throw from the rink.  We pulled into the crowded parking lot about 6:15 or so and headed in. The bar was packed with what seemed to be a lot of Fish Fry eaters. We grabbed a table in the grotto and swung by the bar to pick up a beer and drop our orders for two $13 plates of perch.We got back to the table with our drinks only to find the bartender on our heels with a couple placemats, bowls of slaw and rolls. We sipped our beers, enjoyed the rolls and stomached the homemade, but very cabbage-y slaw. About 15 minutes or so later she brought our steaming plates of perch and we dove in. The perch was simply outstanding, it is almost too much for words. The 8 delicious fillets are clearly hand battered with a combination of seasonings that cant be beat. They taste simply remarkable to the point where you dont even realize you are eating fish. I have to imagine if God was to fry his own fish this is what he would make. It is damn near perfection.The fries were also great which was a serious bonus. They were skin-on, straight cut and fried just as well as the fish. It was great since I have had them be hit and miss in the past. The tartar was also superb. It was nice a thick and had a good amount of relish that really blends well with the heavily seasoned perch.You have to realize that this is a bar so there is no dedicated wait staff, only bartenders. That being said they seem to do a pretty good job managing their bartending duties and not letting the fish sit and get cold. I can see this being an issue in the future as they seem to be getting busier and busier as word about their fish is getting out. As of now they have it on lock down and are doing a fine job. Overall this is a great Fish Fry. The fish is amazing, the fries have come a long way since the grease bombs I got on my first visit and the tartar makes the meal. The roll and slaw are just fine and do their job of holding you over until the real food comes just as they should. In the end we got to see the whole inaugural Ice Muskies game and get an amazing Fish Fry beforehand. I think God would be pleased with our decision. Hell, St. Petes has another Fish Fry in a couple weeks anyway and God willing, we will be there. Until then, we can remember a fun hockey game and the great fish we enjoyed before it. iViva la Villa!www.facebook.com/ChicosVillaTap/?sk=timeline&app_data2302 Packers AvenueMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-9627",3496,0.22147266313932976,0.5785273368606701

Do we have time to get a Fish Fry, pick up someone on the east side, drive to Miller Park and make it inside for the first pitch? Survey says: close, but not quite.We had some friends heading to a Brewer’s game and they offered us a couple seats. I realized The Crew was out of contention but any excuse to go to Miller Park is a good one so I agreed and figured it would just mean eating Fish Fry a little earlier than usual. The Georges rolled into town around 4:30 and since we needed to be quick I offered up two nearby establishments for dinner, one being the Northside VFW and the other being the Villa Tap. They chose the “dive bar” option over the “VFW” option so we headed to the Villa.We pulled in just before 5pm and headed into the dimly lit tavern, our ears alive with the sounds of some serious Ozzy on the stereo. We grabbed three open seats at the bar and ordered a round of drinks from the bartender/waitress. Since it was before 5pm I asked her how long until we could get a couple orders of lake perch and she said she would put it in as soon as she could. As we sat back to sip our beers she brought over a little basket of bread and a couple bowls of slaw, I would say it was plenty soon. I started my warm up with the slaw ASAP because I was absolutely starving. While it wasn’t great it was easily edible as was the bread which was a very plain-Jane white roll. Within 5-7 minutes the fish was fried and served to us boiling hot. My hunger stepped to the plate. I wound up and fired my first pitch immediately by grabbing a perch filet with my hands only to find it so hot and delicate that trying to hold the fish and dip it became a futile endeavor. I eventually settled on a hands and fork combination that worked well and enabled me to get the proper fish/tartar ratio on each and every bite. There is no other way to describe the perch than fantastic. All three large pieces were fried perfectly and totally greaseless. It was incredibly light and flaky with a seriously light “breading”. If you don’t like “fishy” tasting fish that this stuff is for you. It was simply delicious, end of story. Strike 1!The French fries were also right over the fat part of the plate. The plentiful, skin-on potatoes were well salted and fried to near perfection. Strike 2! Striking out a big timer like my hunger isn’t always easy and the last pitch was a bit of curve ball. The tartar was a nice a thick mix which was a little sweet but still very good. However, it wasn’t overly plentiful and by the end I was doing some serious scarping. Regardless it caught the edge of the plate and brought the slugger down. Strike 3!Thanks to a couple good warm up pitches I had no trouble sending my hunger back to pine. The lake perch was simply outstanding and possibly the best out there. One of the Georges also thought it was probably the best he had ever had. The fries were excellent and the tartar was the capper to a great Fish Fry. The only complaint I really have is that the fish is so good I just want more and more even if I am full. I can easily highly recommend this Fish Fry especially when you consider we were in and out in less than 30 minutes! I will be back for this “Tavern Fish Fry” many times to come. While we did miss the top half of the first inning the Brewers went on to win the game. What’s more, we got to see Hoffman come in and take down the Astros just like the Villa Tap took down my hunger, 1-2-3. Ozzy at the Villa Tap and Hells Bells at Miller Park, what more could a Wisconsinite ask for on a Friday night?www.facebook.com/ChicosVillaTap/?sk=timeline&app_data2302 Packers AvenueMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-9627",3690,0.20415674603174608,0.5141482426303855

My assumption was vastly incorrect and basically no one was interested so it was just the regulars. Since we were downtown I racked my brain to think of a place that I had not been to. The only ones that came to mind were the Tornado Club, Brocach and the Comeback In. The Tornado had an hour long wait, Brocah didn’t sound great because I had cod earlier in the day and the CBI is, well, the CBI. Eventually we decided to just head towards our house and stop by the Villa Tap on the way.We arrived at about 8:00 and grabbed a couple stools right at the bar. We threw our order at the husky bartender/waiter-dude and sat back to enjoy the beers he chucked our way. He also didn’t hesitate to grab us a bowl of slaw and couple rolls each. I actually enjoyed the slaw, and had no problem putting it away, along with my cool, crisp pint of the Cow. About 10 minutes later we were ready for the fish, and it was ready for us.We both opted for the perch and it was fantastic. It was fried up by another equally husky dude who really seemed to know what he was doing. I love seeing the big mixing bowl of fresh homemade batter and Villa Tap has it, and then some. I am fairly certain that the cook has broken down KFC’s blend of 11 herbs and spices because this stuff is dead on and delicious. It is so good you basically forget you are even eating fish and just plow it down without thinking. Gabe actually wound up with no fish and entire plate of fries left. Colonel Sanders would be proud.My previous two visits the French fries were hit and miss, this time they were just right. Skin on potatoes fried to a perfect reddish-gold were the perfect match for the flavorful perch. The tartar also complimented the perch well and was adequate, although a tiny bit more certainly would not have hurt (I like to dip what’s left of my fries in it once the fish is gone). Overall, I am glad we skipped the rush of downtown and took another chance on the Villa Tap. This is truly a great Fish Fry and I am surprised that more people haven’t caught on to this one. Sure, the atmosphere may leave a little something to be desired, but I have seen much worse and for food this good it is well worth it.

While the Cod I got was good I was left longing for the Perch which I heard was the best in the city. The Perch is only served for dinner and I have a hard time getting people to go to dinner at bars due to the lack of variety. This week was different however; we had a group of Fish Fry loyalists who were all in the mood for fried goods. This made The Villa Tap an option and I jumped at the opportunity to get my hands on this Perch. I am glad I did.The Lake Perch at the Villa Tap will run you about $12 for 6 or 7 nice sized fillets and is well worth it. The fish was excellent. It has a delicious, fried chicken-style, batter which was reminiscent of the Old Fashioned or the North Side VFW. The fish itself was also delicious and really well complimented by the spicy batter. The French fries were about what I remember although they seemed slightly overcooked this time while I think they were slightly undercooked last time. Either way they were pretty good. The tartar sauce was also a nice combo of mayo and relish and tasted just fine. I had no trouble finishing my delicious plate of fish and two cups of the tartar.The basket of rolls that came before the fish was very average as was the runny (but surprisingly tasty) coleslaw. Both were acceptable but were certainly not the highlights of the meal. For it being Friday the 21st of November the Villa was not really very busy. We were the only group of people in the place who were not sitting at the bar and it appeared one of only two groups of people eating dinner. It left me wondering if it was due to the economy being in the crapper or if everyday patrons were already out of town for deer hunting. Regardless, we had a quaint table in a ‘dank’ part of the bar we lovingly dubbed “The Grotto”. A pool table over your shoulder and a Schlitz in hand, this is what Fish Fry is all about. Overall this was a very good Fish Fry. The Cod I got the first time was good but the Perch on this visit was fantastic. I would have a hard time saying it was the absolute best in the city but I can comfortably put it in the top 5. The Villa Tap is straight-up Wisconsin bar, don’t expect anything fancy but if you are looking for a tasty plate of Lake Perch you can definitely find it here.

I heard through the grapevine that the Villa Tap on Packers Avenue had a great Fish Fry so I convinced some people that we needed to try it out, and away we went. The Villa Tap is a very low-key establishment located right in the heart of Madison’s North Side. It is a very typical looking Wisconsin bar complete with a foosball in the entryway and other bar games scattered throughout the place. We were the first people in the bar so we grabbed a table near the window and put in our order with the bartender. I actually heard the Lake Perch was the best in the city, but was somewhat saddened to hear it was only served for dinner. Since we were there for lunch our only option was the two piece cod for $7.50. The cod was pretty good, but not excellent. It was served ridiculously hot and had a good, homemade batter which we watched the cook prepare as we sat there. The fish itself was somewhat flaky but may have been a little overcooked to the point where it was starting to get mushy and lose some of its texture. Overall it was just fine but certainly not the best out there.The French fries were skin-on, straight cut potatoes and very good. They bordered on excellent but lacked a little something that I could not put my finger on. The tartar was heavy on the relish resulting in a sweeter than average mix which was quite good. The coleslaw and rolls came out before the fish was served which is always nice. The bread was a little cold but still good. The slaw was also pretty good but certainly not the best I have had. Overall this was a perfectly good lunchtime bar Fish Fry. The big three: Fish, fries and tartar were all good and the ancillary items were also perfectly acceptable. I would say that I can easily recommend the cod at The Villa Tap but I must go back and try the Lake Perch sometime.www.facebook.com/ChicosVillaTap/?sk=timeline&app_data2302 Packers AvenueMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-9627",2056,0.2784088654401154,0.5521829906204908

We took the trip to north earlier this year only to find the establishment closed for remodeling. It was a bit of a bummer, but I wasnt about to let it deter me. We had fish in Arlington that night, but I knew I would make it back to the Prairie Inn at some point for their famous Ton on a Tin Fish Fry. It was an unseasonably warm 6th of November, so we decided to circle the wagons and give the Prairie Inn their second chance. We moseyed into North Leeds pert near 7pm and saddled up a couple stools at the bar. The place seemed a little busy but the hostess acted like it was pandemonium. She told us we would have to wait, but we had no idea what was in store for us. We had a round of drinks and then another and then just as we were about to get one more (1 hour and 30 minutes later) she came to get us. We left the bar and walked about 5 feet to the Stagecoach where we would be served.We were slightly perturbed by the wait, but I have come to expect it and try not to get too worked up about it. A good experience with a good waitress would have been enough to make up for it, unfortunately for us the waitress we got was not on her game (actually Im not sure she was even playing the right sport). It took her about five minutes to show up at our table after we were seated and was no better thereafter.Gabe and I both went for the AYCE Ton on a Tin for $11 (even though we knew ffm.com recommended the catch of the day instead). From the time we placed our orders about 20-25 minutes elapsed before our fish would come, which in terms of Fish Fry service is a long time. To our waitress credit the fish was nice and hot which means she served it quickly after it was ready. The fish was actually pretty good, although not served on a tin (essentially an upside-down garbage can lid) as advertised. The cod was not really flavorful but was flaky and did have a fairly light batter. It was good enough but after our long wait we found it a little hard to swallow. I put my fist three pieces away in no time but had to hail the waitress and ask her for more fish, not the other way around (at an AYCE I expect the restaurant to practically force the fish down my throat). She did bring three more when I asked for two, but when Gabe asked for more she said he didnt get the AYCE even though that option is non-existent.The French fry situation was not much better. The steak cut fries were good but nothing really special. However, I really like my potatoes and when I asked for more to go with the AYCE fish I was told they had run out. Good lord, I thought. The tartar sauce was actually really good and helped to kick the fish and the fries up a notch which probably saved their asses as far as were concerned. The homemade slaw was also pretty decent although our waitress forgot to bring it out with the fish and was only willing to get me the side upon request. There was also a complete lack of bread present which really sucked and Im sure is supposed to come with the Fish Fry. I had high hopes for this Fish Fry based on the positive reviews. The food was actually pretty good but the service was just awful. Besides our waitress, the rest of the staff also seemed like they would have much rather been somewhere else. All in all we spent around two and a half hours are the Prairie Inn of which maybe 30 minutes was actually spent dining. The food was fine but certainly not worth the hassle we had to put up with. Overall, I can barely recommend this Fish Fry even if it does come with their famous crab dip which like the Fish Fry itself is nothing to write home about.prairieinnsupperclub.comHwy 22 & 60North Leeds, WI 53911     (608) 635-7272",3825,0.1333275808275808,0.46994500994501004

Believe me, we tried. When we showed up at 6:30 Jer and I figured wed be in and out in a flash leaving us plenty of time to head downtown for some beers and show afterwards. We were wrong.We entered the bar, and despite the extreme swivel-factor (props to MadisonAtoZ for that one), immediately headed for a couple open stools at the bar next to a pleasant looking older lady. We asked her if they were open, and she said they were. We sat down and waited with money in hand for the bartender to come by.When she finally did come over several minutes later there was no Hey, how ya doin? or Welcome to The Willows. only a stern look and a call for IDs! Fair enough, she has to be on the lookout for under-agers, right? We provided our credentials which she scoured though like they were secret FBI documents potentially leading to the capture of Osama Bin Laden. Eventually she gave them back by throwing them on the bar and stomped away to grab us a couple Spotted Cows. Yeesh, real friendly around here, we thought. Jer mentioned her less-than-congenial attitude to our octogenarian friend and she just said there had been a lot of under-age drinking operations going on around these parts and she had to do what she had to do. Understandable, but does she need to be a raging you-know-what while doing it? Apparently, she did.She returned with our drinks, slammed them down, and immediately turned her back on us even though we clearly were trying to inquire about getting some fish. As we waited (for her to return?) we struck up a conversation with our friend. We talked about the upcoming pre-season Packer game, and got the lowdown on the Fish Fry, which she claimed was very good.Of course, the Amazonian bartender never came back (we werent HER regulars after all) so Jer did his best improv act and tried to hail down the young waitress who was running around the place. Can we get some fish? he asked. Sure, did you guys see the hostess? she politely responded. No, we didnt see her. Is there a hostess? we asked. Dont worry about it she said, Ill tell her you guys want a table. Excellent, we were in! (Or so we thought).We watched as she walked away to go wait on her tables, but she never did talk to anyone who even remotely resembled a hostess. We did get to watch her run around the dining area, clear some plates, and even head outside for a smoke though. We waited, waited, and waited some more, our beers ever dwindling. Eventually we sat there for another 20 minutes, waiting like a couple of dolts, a table clearly not in our future. As the last sips of beer went down, we had a choice to make. Wait, grab another beer (from the other bartender hopefully), or just head out and find our Fish Fry fix elsewhere. We felt unbelievably slighted and our business unwanted. It sucked, so we just cut our losses and got ready to go.While getting up from our stools our old lady friend says Were you guys gonna eat? Well we responded, we wanted to, but never got the chance. Oh. She said, seeming interested, but not all that worried about it. As we got ready to leave, Jer happened to bump into a younger girl who was playing pool and had been sitting near us at the bar. She jokingly says Way to suck up to the owner. Wait, what? The owner, you say? That nice old lady we were sitting next to was the OWNER!? Get the f*ck outta here She sat there the whole time, her bartender being rude as hell, knowing we wanted to eat, but not getting service, and didnt say anything!? No f*cking way. It just isnt possible It simply cannot happen That isnt the way things are done Unfortunately for us, it did just happen, and we felt even more insulted than we did before. We left, as pissed as ever.Now, Jer and I are both small town boys, weve been to literally hundreds of small town bars between us, and neither of us could recall EVER being treated in such a manner. It was bizarre, like something out of the Twilight Zone. It was simply an awful experience and I for one will never give them another chance to prove their Fish Fry prowess. It was total BS, which really sucks because The Willows is literally one of the closest taverns to my house and I could have seen making it a frequent haunt. No way that will ever happen now.Unfortunately, it looked like the regulars received much better treatment, which only served to alienate us even further. I guess if you arent a regular you should probably just stay out of The Willows and head to the much more hospitable Villa Tap instead. Thats what we wound up doing  and probably should have just done in the first place.5485 Willow RoadWaunakee, WI 53597     (608) 244-8458",4928,0.07362488977072308,0.4512778116944784

The AYCE fish was great however and made any delay in eating well worth it. Since the food was so good I knew we needed to come back with a crew that was in the mood for All You Can Eat sometime, and June 5th turned out to be the perfect day for it.We agreed to meet some friends around 7:00 and were not really surprised when we showed up shortly after the hour and were the first ones there. Last time the Snug was packed, and our party of two waited at the bar for a good 20 to 30 minutes. This trip was drastically different; we got right in and were escorted to a semi-private dining room where we ordered some drinks and waited for the rest of our group. As we waited we looked over the menu. On the last page the Friday special was listed: AYCE Fish Fry $12.99. Well, at least that is what most of the menus said. Gabe got the one out of date one that still had the Fish Fry for $11.99, which in itself was somewhat alarming since the last time we were here it was only $10.95! Regardless of the price, once everyone showed up they almost all went for the AYCE.On our previous visit we got a basket of rolls before the Fish Fry which were outstanding, but his time there was none to be found. Someone in our group ordered an appetizer platter and I think the bread simply got overlooked, but by the time the fish came I was wishing I had a little. The cod was also different. Last time there were numerous tiny fillets whereas this time I only got two larger chunks. They were still well fried and had a good batter but just were not as fun to eat nor were they scalding hot when served. At an AYCE I also prefer more small pieces since that ensures more trips to the kitchen for freshly fried fish. It is kind of a copout to give you two big pieces which can get cold if you don’t eat them quickly. For this being an AYCE  Fish Fry, only two people in our party ordered a second helping even though everyone claimed to have enjoyed it.The steak fries were very good, although like the fish they could have been slightly hotter. The tartar was also not what I remember it being but was still fine. For the life of me I have no recollection of the coleslaw so I can’t really say much about it. The waitress we had was also very polite and accommodating of our large party.Overall this trip to Erin’s Snug was a bit of a letdown for me since I had such good memories from the previous visit. Everything about it just seemed to have taken a step back. The fish was not as finely done, the tartar seemed off and things were not served as hot as a Fish Fry needs to be. Perhaps some of this is the result of having a large group but maybe the hike in price coupled with slipping food quality is the reason we had no trouble getting a table at 7pm on a Friday night? Regardless, this trip really takes Erin’s from “Highly Recommendable” into the less-recommendable strata.www.erinssnug.com4601 American ParkwayMadison, WI 53718     (608) 242-7616",3096,0.17856859806859798,0.46134831834831835

This is a great way to find out about places you have never heard of. We recently got a message from someone saying that the best Fish Fry in town was Erin’s Sung Irish Pub on the East side near American Family. When a claim like his is made I feel the need to verify it for myself because if they say it is THE BEST then I assume it is at least pretty damn good. Erin’s Sung was pretty damn good.We got to the modern style Irish pub about 8pm and put our name on the list. The Fish Fry special was posted right when we walked inn “All You Can East Fish Fry - $10.95”. The place was not too busy but it was standing room only at the sizable bar. After about 20 minutes a large group of people got called and we were able to get a couple stools at the bar and in another 10 minutes or so and it was our turn. We got seated in “The Castle” which was nice because we got a table right next to the fireplace which was great since it was a little chilly. I looked over the menu quickly since I saw online they had Bluegill on the daily menu and I wanted to make sure I made the correct choice. I asked our waitress about the Fish Fry special and she said they were flying out the door. I was curious how the cod was prepared because often times at Irish pubs they will give you one massive cod filet. When it comes this way it is usually greasy and hard to eat. I was reassured by our waitress that they break the filets up and serve their fish in smaller pieces, much more in tunes with my “eat it with your hands” philosophy. So, I opted for the cod instead of the Bluegill figuring that I could come back another day and try them then since they are on the everyday menu. Before the fish came we were treated to a lovely basket or warm rolls which did a fine job of holding us over until the main course arrived. The cod came and it was outstanding. The pieces were thin, flaky and had a delicious batter. They definitely don’t give you one massive piece; in fact it was almost too thin but tasted great. The steak cut fries were also cooked perfectly and absolutely superb. The tartar sauce was wonderful and was the perfect compliment to the tasty cod. The big three elements of the Fish Fry were all outstanding, not much more needs to be said. In addition the coleslaw was actually very good and I think I ate almost my entire portion. Erin’s Snug is a pretty new place and with new places you tend to have a lot of business on Friday nights which can lead to slow service. The service at Erin’s Snug was good but was semi-slow. Our waitress was attentive and polite and seemed to have the fish up as soon as it was ready to go so I assume it was a slow kitchen and not a slow waitress. Overall this was a fantastic Fish Fry. I would have a hard time saying it was the best in Madison but it is certainly highly recommendable. The Fish, fries and tartar were all well above average and the rest of the dinner was good too. I will definitely go back to the Snug at some point. Since the “Fish Fry” was so good I really need to go back to try the Bluegill since I can get them any day of the week. This is the best Irish Pub Fish Fry I can remember eating, so while maybe it isn’t #1 overall it is #1 for Irish Pubs and that is still saying quite a bit. www.erinssnug.com4601 American ParkwayMadison, WI 53718     (608) 242-7616",3480,0.24843173110414477,0.5247414207759036

Since Player’s Sports Bar is right up the street and I had never been there before I thought this would be a good opportunity to give them a shot. The rest of the guys at the office didn’t seem to agree. They wanted to stay mired in their rut and head to Wilson’s yet again. So we went our separate ways; I to Players, them to Wilson’s. Player’s is your typical Wisconsin Sports Bar. Not much more needs to be said about the ambiance. Since I was flying solo I decided to just sit at the bar and have myself a quick and dirty Fish Fry. I ordered myself a Spotted Cow and “The Fish Plate” in one fell swoop and waited. While waiting I enjoyed the Spotted Cow which was icy cold and delicious, a sure sign that they keep their tap lines clean. The “Fish Plate” is a standard Fish Fry lunch: 3 piece cod with French fries, coleslaw, tartar sauce and bread and will run you $6.75. It was ready about 5 minutes after I ordered it.Since I was sitting at the bar and the fryer is practically right there I could watch the owner prepare the food pretty easily. The fish was frozen, pre-battered filets which were clearly not “homemade” in any sense of the word. Even so they actually tasted pretty decent but were slightly greasy and had poor texture. If I had to wager I would say it is the same fish they have at the Glass Nickel and the Argus, which is decent but never great. The French fries were straight cut potatoes with the skins left on which were cooked and salted perfectly. The tartar sauce was also very good but served in a tiny cup which left me scraping the bottom. The bread served for a lunch time Fish Fry at a bar is usually less than desirable. Player’s serves up a nice sized piece of grilled Texas toast which is definitely above average. What was not above average was the coleslaw; it was just not very good at all. I will leave it at that. Overall this was an okay Fish Fry, it was nothing special but still decent. It is just not quite recommendable. The French fries, tartar sauce and toast were the highlights of the meal while the fish was just not that great. I am glad I gave it a shot but if I had to choose a Fish Fry in the Atwood neighborhood there are some better alternatives.2013 Winnebago StreetMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-9722",2325,0.14022909189575852,0.4914104311326533

I usually waffle a little bit each Friday because I have a tough time choosing between old favorites and new places. When I asked Gabe where we were going on this special day there was no hesitation, he said “Fitzgerald's”, and that was that. Gabe likes the big guys because you are damn near guaranteed a great Fish Fry and on your birthday you want this guarantee.We showed up around 8pm, put our name on the list and grabbed a couple drinks from the bar. About 20 minutes later our light-up coaster thing went off and we headed into the LCD’d dining room (if you are confused by the LCD part just go to the restaurant and you will see what I mean). The waitress came within a few minutes and got ready for the fish orders. Fitzgerald’s serves a full menu on Friday but the main choice is between the AYCE (from the kitchen) or the buffet. Since buffets are hit and miss I recommend the AYCE fresh and hot from the kitchen and that is what everyone in our party went with.Prior to the fish you are treated to a nice loaf of bread, complete with little cutting board and knife to slice it yourself, as well as a massive bowl of slaw which is actually really good. We tried not to fill up too much since we knew the AYCE Haddock was on its way, but it is tough when these items are so good. The first round of fish hit the table and was gone instantly; we put in the second order when she was still present and began enjoying our spread. The haddock was superb as it always is. The fish and batter were both light and flaky, just as they should be. We enjoyed all three rounds of fish although would have liked the turn around to be slightly quicker (I did have a few minutes without a piece of fried fish present on my plate which is heartbreaking at an AYCE). Regardless, the fish is definitely top quality and when coupled with the nearly perfect tartar makes for a euphoric taste worthy of Olympus.The French fries are straight cut home style fries which do a good job adding to the fish without drawing too much attention to themselves. On Friday nights the haddock is the star of the show at Fitzgerald’s and that is the way it should be.Fitzgerald’s is a classic Supper Club with the classic Friday night crowds. You should expect to have a short wait and enjoy a couple drinks at the bar knowing that they are pumping people in and out as fast as they can. The service is usually very good since they are hyper-focused on getting the fish out while it is nice and hot. Overall this was simply another great Fish Fry at Fitzgerald’s and a happy birthday for the Gabester. www.foodspot.com/fitzgeralds3112 Parmenter StreetMiddleton, WI 53562     (608) 831-7107",2782,0.20909664561303903,0.5008297849691294

Based on the fact that we hadn’t been to Fitzgerald’s in Middleton for a while I decided rather than risk sub-par fish at a new place we would hit an old standby. It turned out to be a wise decision.There are a lot of options for Fish Fry at Fitzgerald’s. They have a buffet of fish choices available which includes cod, haddock, chicken, steak and all the other normal buffet choices. But this is Friday night and I’m not here for the buffet or the salad bar, I came for Fish Fry served steaming hot, direct from the kitchen. Fish on the buffet line is never as hot and fresh from the fryer which is how a good Fish Fry should be. I always choose the AYCE Haddock with French Fries and am always pleased. I have heard of people opting for the buffet and being under whelmed.The Haddock is lightly battered, flaky and very good overall. It is served all you can eat which is great due to the fact the fish is so good. The French Fries are strait cut potatoes with the skins left on, which is sweet. They were cooked perfectly. The tartar sauce was plentiful and tasted great. It was thick and creamy with a good percentage of relish. The coleslaw was actually very good. Almost everyone agreed that may be the best they had ever eaten. Possibly the best feature was the little loaves of bread that you get to slice yourself. The service itself was actually pretty good and the place was not packed as it often is on Friday nights. We actually got seated in about 15 minutes, which is perfectly acceptable. Fitzgerald’s is one of the best places to get Fish Fry on Friday night in Madison; they even had a drive-thru for Fish Fry lovers on the go. Truly remarkable. Just make sure you get the AYCE Haddock rather than the buffet if you want the full Fish Fry experience. www.foodspot.com/fitzgeralds3112 Parmenter StreetMiddleton, WI 53562     (608) 831-7107",1975,0.330851290684624,0.5498294051627387

Yes, we had Fish Fry at Fitzgeralds, and yes, it was good (Im pretty sure). However, the details of the evening are a little fuzzy to me at this point. You see, when it came time for Madison Fish Frys bachelor party it seemed like common sense to start the festivities off with an AYCE Fish Fry. Wouldnt you? No problem, I thought. Well just throw back some fish with some good friends, have a few beers, and see where the evening takes us. Well, good friends sometimes have bad ideas, and a few of them figured it wasnt a bachelor party without a numerous shots of various brown liquors for yours truly. Bad idea, my friends, bad idea. From what I recall, we arrived at Fitzgeralds and were pretty surprised at how few people were out for Fish Fry this Friday. Perhaps they knew a party was brewing and wanted to avoid the ruckus? For whatever reason, the place was damn-near deserted which gave me an uneasy feeling. Regardless, we were here for AYCE Fish Fry and were ready to pay the piper. We were seated at a big table all by our lonesomes, well away from any and all other diners. At this point the first of what would be several shots arrived for the lucky guy. No matter, I thought, Ill just put it down and that will be that (yeah right). I easily stomached this first blow as it nestled lovingly in my gut atop the three or four Beamers that were taken previously at home. At this point we also all put in our orders. Everyone went with the AYCE from the kitchen, even though the waiter was pushing the buffet. Ha-ha waiter Joe, we knew better. We have played this game before.Once the waiter had gone we all sat back and began the normal bachelor party BSing. At this point, another shot arrived  thanks guys  and everything stepped up a notch. The first order of business was the slaw and bread which were dropped along with my shot. The little loafs of self-slice bread were great, and the standard supper club slaw was right on the money. The fish came some time later and was hot, but not scalding when it arrived. It and the fries were served in heaping piles, family-style, and the boys wasted no time tearing the presentation apart. The haddock fillets were very tasty. The light and flaky fish was well complimented by the delicate batter which I somehow remember precisely. I tried as best I could, and got down two pieces almost instantly. Since we knew the portion presented on this first round would be nowhere near enough, we immediately re-upped, and sent them back for more fish and fries (and apparently more shots).As I enjoyed a few of the perfectly fried crinkle-cut fries, another drink found its way to the table. This dastardly conglomeration was known as The Three Wisemen, and if you know anything about it, it is not the kind of thing you want to drink during dinner. At this point I wasnt ready to be completely blitzed and did what we could to avoid taking it, but being the fool I am, was easily talked into it. After stomaching much of it, and taking a short break, I tried to return to the fish, and managed to get one more piece (or close to it) down. These pieces were from the second round were much hotter and fresher than their predecessor, according to Jer. Ill have to take his word on that. From this point on there is not really much more I can say. I seem to recall leaving a piece or two of fish uneaten on my plate, but cant really be sure. By the time we got up to leave I was feeling no pain, but knew I had eaten my share of tasty fish (and managed to keep it down, despite my friends best efforts). Overall, I am pretty surprised at how much I actually remember from this Fish Fry, although I certainly dont have all the details down. The fish, fries and tartar were all very good, and the service was very punctual, especially considering the size of our group and the intermittent shots that the waiter was also responsible for delivering. In addition, the slaw and bread were supper club standard, and easily above average. I still feel very confident highly recommending this Fish Fry and am kind of curious as to why they were not busier. Ill chalk it up to the fact it was past 8 oclock and the bulk of their patrons had likely already been there and done that, cause it certainly aint for a lack of quality fish! MFF wants to thank Fitzgeralds for helping make his bachelor party a night to remember, and his friends for getting him drunk enough to forget. We all had a fantastic time, and will be back anytime we are looking for a great AYCE Fish Fry.

The Hilltop is one of those kinds of places that you tell yourself you are going to make an effort to go to more often, and then for one reason or another, you just dont. I decided that we simply couldnt put it off anymore and had to pay them another visit to give them a proper review. I corralled a full crew of supper club lovin folks, and agreed to meet at The Top at 8pm, sharp.Well, sharp may be a bit rigid of a term. Thanks to the Pedros Happy Hour (which is pretty frickin sweet, by the way), a couple of us didnt get there until about ten-after. As soon as we sauntered in we saw our buddies at the bar. We grabbed a couple beers, and in no time were headed to our table - nestled lovingly away in the corner  under the bright pink, electric Easter egg. We chatted for a bit, sipped our drinks (Jeff was loving his Old Fashioneds), and waited for Dave to come over. Eventually Dave stopped by. Hi, Dave. The Hilltop has a good variety of fish available on Friday nights, beginning with their $11 full portion of cod. They round out the Friday menu with a small portion of walleye for $11.75 or lake perch for $10.75. As Dave worked his way around the table he seemed pleasantly surprised to take an order for each. Classic Gabe, of course, opted for the classic cod. While LP Brice, landed on lake perch. I branched out and went with walleye, but woefully, Judas Jer, having fried once earlier in the day, opted for the broasted chicken instead. Equally woeful was the fact that when presented with side options, he picked the soup over the tomato juice. Not many places offer tomato juice as a side, and kind of like potato pancakes, when one is presented with it you invariably take it, if out of nothing more than mere curiosity. Unfortunately, the same option was not presented to anyone else and I eventually settled on coleslaw. No tomato juice was drunk at our table this night. The slaw was pretty decent, but largely forgettable, especially when compared to the tiny bread loaf that came at the same time. The loaf comes with its own cutting board and knife to slice it, and most know that if you take charge of it, it becomes your duty to cut the loaf for the whole table. MFF is a bread-cutting kinda guy and portioned it out for everyone at the table after Gabe snuck one for himself quick. We finished the bread, our friend Dave brought more drinks and within 15 minutes the fish hit the table.The walleye was served nice and hot and from first appearance looked very good. It was adorned with a light batter (in texture and color) which was very brittle. The fish was equally delicate and was nice and flaky, but didnt have a ton of flavor. It was so light it was barely even like eating, and the tartar easily overwhelmed the fish if not properly portioned. Speaking of portions, the amount of fish was underwhelming and certainly reflected in the, relatively cheap, $11.75 price tag. Lets just say, I could have eaten more. Luckily for me, there was more fish on the table.While the walleye was perfectly acceptable the piece of the cod I received from Gabe and was much more impressive. The pure white cod had a near perfect beer batter and much more flavor than the blandish walleye fillet. LP also claimed it to be superior to his perch as the full order of cod was more than Gabe could handle and he doled it out to any interested party. Accompanying my walleye was a fair amount of crispy and delicious fries. They were a homemade Julienne cut, and superbly fried.  The tartar was also made in house and simply a classic blend, with a good amount of the relish and a classic mayo base. Both of these items complimented the walleye well, but worked just as well, if not better, with the cod.  Overall, this Fish Fry is easily recommendable, and probably highly so. While my walleye wasnt out of this world, the cod was very good, and certainly worth the drive to The Plains. The Hilltop is a classic old school supper club, complete with all the old school charms. Yeah, it might be a little dingy for some, but where else in this day and age are you going to find the table-top Ms. Pac-Man? Nowhere, thats where. In addition, Dave did a great job, and got their homemade fare into our hungry hands lickety-split. This is a great all around Fish Fry and we will definitely be hitting up the Hilltop again.4173 County Road PCross Plains, WI 53528     (608) 798-2893",4754,0.24798928956695956,0.5660502388657729

Most people are feeling guilty about eating too much with the family and the last thing on their minds is piling on a Fish Fry. While I don’t necessarily feel guilty about it I try to pace myself during the holidays to make sure I still get my Fish Fry in every Friday. Since Thanksgiving was on a Thursday it was a little more difficult this year. We had two Thanksgivings to attend on Thursday and by the time Friday night rolled around I had eaten turkey for three meals in a row and about reached my limit. Since most of the delicious Thanksgiving goodies come from Mom’s stove I was more than ready to have something deep fried from a real restaurant. I heard that Gus’ Diner in Sun Prairie had a pretty good Fish Fry and that it was AYCE so I was ready to give them a shot.We arrived at the 50’s style diner about 7pm and had no trouble getting seated right away. The diner was pretty vacant but there were a few groups of people scattered around, a few of which were enjoying the Fish Fry. The only choice for the AYCE Fish Fry is Cod which comes with choice of potato and a trip to the salad bar for $9. We put in our order with our friendly young waitress and headed to the salad bar immediately. For a diner this was a very nice salad bar. It was clean and all the items looked and tasted very fresh. The coleslaw was available on the salad bar and was pretty decent and was a fine start to the Fish Fry.We finished our salads and the fish was on the table shortly after. The Cod was served steaming hot but unfortunately it didn’t taste great. It had a thick and kind of greasy batter. The fish itself was slightly heavy and not flaky which resulted in a kind of mushy texture. This is usually the case when restaurants get frozen, pre-breaded filets and just drop them in the fryer which is never as good as a ‘homemade’ Fish Fry. When you get fish like this it is usually hit and miss, one piece tastes fine and the next is nasty. This was exactly the case at Gus’. I attribute this to a lack of quality control because the chef does not actually see the unbreaded fish so he has no idea what is underneath. When places make homemade batter they see each piece of fish before it is battered and can weed out the bad pieces. At least that is my take on it.The French fries were crinkle cut style and covered with season salt (Lawry’s) which made them very good. The tartar sauce was also very good and our waitress had no problem with bringing us a couple extra servings. What was surprising was the fact that we didn’t get any sort of bread with the Fish Fry, although there was a side of green beans this in no way suffices for a lack of bread.Overall this was a decent Fish Fry but with so many other great places out there I just can’t quite recommend it, even if it is AYCE. The service was great and the prices were very reasonable. The establishment itself was very nice and they have a broad menu of other things which looked quite good. We will be back to try some of their other food but as of now I really would not come back specifically for the Fish Fry.www.explorewisconsin.com/gusdiner/630 North Westmount DriveSun Prairie, WI 53590     (608) 318-0900",3246,0.1942438867438867,0.5492401329901331

I would love to be able to walk up to the corner, grab a quick beer, and shoot the sh*t with my local bartender. There is nothing like the camaraderie of the neighborhood bar, and in Wisconsin, it is a well known fact that these kinds of places often offer the finest in Fish Fry. Alas, our neighborhood is very residential and extremely isolated making any visit to a bar a driving affair. It came to our attention that Pauls Neighborhood Bar in Middleton was offering a fantastic all you can eat Fish Fry featuring both cod and ocean perch. Since I am always down for a good AYCE, I hopped the trolley with a few friends in tow and headed towards Mr. Pauls Neighborhood.  We arrived at Pauls shortly before 8pm and were coaxed into the bar by the aroma of fried fish. I have driven past the bar a number of times, but never really took notice of how large the establishment is. Upon entering I was slightly taken aback to see a spacious horseshoe bar, accompanied by a fairly large dining space. We pulled a couple stools out of the way and grabbed some drinks before hitting the dining room and finding a table. Our waitress came over a minute or two after everyone was seated and took our orders. Pretty much everyone went for the $10.75 AYCE Fish Fry, but varied on how many pieces of cod versus perch. I started with two of each, and chose French fries instead of baked potato or hash browns. She took our order to the kitchen and brought back some pretty tasty coleslaw and six pre-packed rolls. Everyone picked at their slaw and the surprisingly soft potato rolls, and within 20 minutes our fish arrived, hot, but not scalding.I was plenty hungry so I dove right in and grabbed a piece of the cod. It had a light batter which didnt have a lot of flavor, but was still good. The fish itself was flaky, but a little greasier than I expected it to be based on the light batter. The ocean perch was similar and also tasted good. As you would expect it was a little fishier tasting than the cod, but not much really. The fish had an exceptionally light texture and a similar, if not the same, batter as the cod. Overall both styles of fish were good, and I was well on my way to eating a good 6-7 pieces. Unfortunately it took a long time to get a refill which gave my food a chance to settle. By the time my final two pieces of cod came I could barely get one down, more or less both of them. I was a bit let down, but chalked it up to the fact that it was probably approaching 9pm and the waitress was ready to be done with it. At an AYCE Fish Fry I have come to expect my fish to be accompanied by AYCE fries and a big squeeze bottle of tartar. The tartar was present as I expected, but the AYCE French fries were nowhere to be found. When I asked if more was an option I was denied instantly. I found it somewhat puzzling since I assume fish is more expensive than potatoes, and you figure they would want you to fill up on spuds rather than meat. Regardless, the initial portion of lukewarm crinkle cut fries was pretty small and gone well before I had my fill of fish. Thankfully the tartar was abundant and served the fish well allowing me to eat it even without the quickly depleted fries. After sleeping on it I dont know what to think about the Fish Fry at Pauls Neighborhood Bar. Im not sure if it is because we werent regulars or what, but they didnt really seem to care about us being there. The food was certainly decent, but the service was a little lackluster. It took too long to get more fish and she never did change the awful telenovela that was inexplicably on instead of the Olympics. Overall, this was a decent Fish Fry, but certainly not the out of this world all AYCE I was hoping for. Between Mulligans earlier in the day and Pauls for dinner it was kind of a disappointing Friday for Fish Fry. I am longing for classic Fish Fry next week. paulsneighborhoodbar.com2401 Parmenter StreetMiddleton, WI 53562     (608) 827-7285",4041,0.08732886904761906,0.4696230158730158

Since we were scheduled to be in town early Saturday morning my hands were tied and we were resigned to eating outside of Madison. Since I still have some friends that live in my hometown we decided that this would at least be a good opportunity to hang out with them and get some fish at the same time, so we headed to the Kickapoo Inn in Readstown.We got out of Madison about 7pm and didn’t arrive at the KI until about 8:45. By this time the Supper Club was practically empty save for the actual bar which had just about every stool full. We took a seat at our table and waited for the rest of our party to show up while enjoying an ice cold Spotted Cow. The KI is a classic Wisconsin style Supper Club. Our table was loaded with all the staples: a dish of veggies including carrots, celery and radishes among others, crisp breads and crackers with a ball of cheese spread, and soft bread rolls. Truly remarkable. This was a great start to what would truly be a great Fish Fry.The only option for Fish Fry was the 3 piece cod for $9. The cod was served ungodly hot and was delicious. It was light and flaky with an almost perfect batter. It was definitely good enough to rival the best in Madison. The French fries were no less tasty and possibly even hotter, it was beautiful. The scalding hot potatoes were straight cut (skin-on, I think) and cooked to perfection. The only problem with this was that my girlfriend pillaged my plate and I only wound up getting a portion of the salty delight.I have been to the KI many, many times growing up and usually when we go for lunch I get the fried chicken sandwich partially because the mayo they have is so good. It is from either Sysco or Reinhart and is as good as Hellmann’s. The tartar sauce is a direct takeoff on the mayo and was superb, seriously maybe the best I have ever had. I just loved it, and they didn’t skimp either which is always refreshing. My worst fear at a Fish Fry is running out of tartar but there is no need to worry about that at the KI.Prior to the fish we were treated to a coleslaw/cottage cheese/salad/soup option of which I went for the cottage cheese. It was just fine and a good precursor to our meal. The service at the KI was great, partially due to the fact we were one of the few groups and service in small towns tends to be friendlier and more laid back. Plus, getting your bill for two and having it come to less than $20 is not something you are gonna find to easily around Mad-town. Overall this Fish Fry helped to put my mind at ease about eating around my hometown on Friday nights, at least I know we can always get some tasty fish at the KI. If you are ever in the Kickapoo Valley region and it is Friday night do not hesitate to stop by and grab some Fish Fry at the KI, you won’t be disappointed. www.kickapooinn.com/827 W Kickapoo StreetReadstown, WI 54652     (608) 629-5565",3037,0.22934422348484845,0.5503472222222224

Its not that we have some sort of bias against them, its just that they never come to mind when we think of Fish Fry. Those we have tried (Growlers in the Crown Plaza comes to mind) have been less than impressive and seem to be priced unreasonably high. We decided to give the new Highland Corner Grill a try after reading a favorable review from the good folks over at Madison A to Z, and gained a little more respect for lobby grub.The Friday Fish Fry special at the corner of Highland and Old University is an AYCE cod affair, and costs a very reasonable $11.00. As you might expect, the place was empty at 5:30 on a Friday which availed us of any table in the room. The very friendly and outgoing hostess/waitress fawned over us (and our baby) the whole time we were there which was actually nice and made the place seem very inviting. The fish came relatively fast, but considering they werent cooking for anyone but us at that point we actually would have expected it a little quicker. Regardless, it was freshly fried and hot, so you wont hear any complaints here. The first plate featured four fat pieces of fish that were pretty standard, but at least hand-battered. The batter was on the thick side which was enough to cover the imperfections in the fish, but not so much that it was all you could taste. It had a rich flavor and paired well with the basic cod. When our attentive waitress came back we asked for one more piece (since four were already swimming around in our belly) and wouldnt you know it, she brought three more. Three! Needless to say we werent about to eat seven pieces total so a couple made the trip home with us and got made into a fish sandwich on Saturday afternoon. A bountiful allotment of steak fries were piled alongside the cod and boasted a bevy of season salt. The salt made them plenty peppy, and melded well with the squishy, potato-y goodness.A surprisingly good tartar complemented the cod and there was lots of it too. It was the thick and creamy stuff and came in a fancy stainless steel ramekin. While it may have just been Sysco it did the job and actually lasted through five pieces of fish which seemed like a huge accomplishment at the time. The slaw also raised a few eyebrows with plenty of zip, although the cabbage appeared to have been cut last year. Like the tartar it may well have been from a big jar, but did what it needed to do although it did look pretty unappetizing. There was no bread served with the fish, but a nice side of garlic-laced mixed veggies sat in for it and were surprisingly tasty.  As Madison A to Z so elegantly pointed out, the Highland Corner Grill simply does good old fashioned home cooking, and their Fish Fry definitely falls into that category. While its not the best youll ever have, its hearty, its reasonably priced, and it gets the job done. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry especially for those who love their AYCE cod.www.inntowner.com2424 University AvenueMadison, WI 53726     (608) 233-8778",3055,0.18236169198033605,0.506691246606501

Fast forward a decade (and a child) and we showed up again much closer to 5:00. Lo and behold, not only was the walleye not sold out, but we were literally the first order of the evening. Oh, how times change.It's $15.75 for ""two huge pieces of walleye"" at the Pennsylvania Ave bar, and the cod and ocean perch we had previously were also still available. Some Sysco slaw and a glistening roll arrive before the fish and in all honesty I had a hard time restraining myself from gobbling them up. I waited for my walleye and was glad I did. The walleye comes as two fillets and are as hefty as you'll find. While individually they are on the small side as far as walleye goes, when added it makes up A LOT of meat for $15.75. While it's tough to say what's what in this day and age, this stuff seemed to be the real deal. It had the look, but not necessarily the flavor of walleye. Of course, it could be that the flavor was just covered up by the beer batter which glistened under the bar lights. It was a good walleye, and while not amazing was definitely good enough. A pile of plain old fries were downright decent, but the waffles our son got were certainly a step up and I'd certainly sample the tots if I had it to do over again. The wife got the baby reds which were the real deal, but basically just boiled potatoes and bland as all get-out. East side bars must share recipes (or at least food distributors) because this tartar was stolen straight from Club LaMark. It was dilly and kinda skunky and unmistakable. It was passable, but little else. Normally when I get a Fish Fry it's easy to say whether I'd come back and try it again. This one is a bit of a tough call, since I'm not really sure where it falls. On one hand, it's a lot of food for the money and every thing was pretty decent, but on the other nothing stood out and it had a very standard Sysco feel to it. It's close for sure, but overall, I think we recommend this Fish Fry, and would likely come back, but the circumstances would have to be juuuust right. 2417 Pennsylvania AvenueMadison, WI 53704     (608) 243-6925",2253,0.0977588383838384,0.5658369408369407

After hearing this I decided to roll the dice on the Slice yet again.I arrived at around 7:45 and met a couple dudes I know shortly thereafter. We sat at the bar and looked over the options listed on board. The cod and perch were both $9.25. The walleye was slightly more at $12.50 but we had nary a chance to order it since it was sold out well in advance of 8pm. I opted for the perch over the cod and sat back to enjoy my bottle of Schlitz. It wasn’t long before the bartender/waitress gave us a couple rolls each, along with a stanky slaw that was actually pretty decent. One roll was of the sesame seed variety while the other was some sort of pumpernickel-rye hybrid. They were both warm and tasty which made me hopeful that the rest of the meal would be equally, if not more, satisfying.

The batter was fairly light but somehow not flaky; it lacked any real taste and just find of fell apart. The fish underneath was kind of mushy and not flaky either. It left me wondering if the fryer was simply too hot and overcooked the fish instantly since the cod had the same batter and was similarly mushy.The straight cut fries were just fine but did not really stand out in any way which is about all that can be said for the tartar sauce as well.

Since we live on the North Side I was particularly confident that all the Fish Frys on this side of town were on lock down. Unbeknownst to me there is a tiny little bar called “Slice’s” near the MATC Apprenticeship campus on Pennsylvania Avenue. I’m not sure exactly how I found out about Slice’s, but once I did there was simply no way for me to look past their Friday Fish Fry.If you are coming into town on 113 Slice’s bar and Grill is located right where Pennsylvania and Packers Avenues come together, on what is actually a pretty quiet little stretch (if you discount the motorcycle permitting lot right next door that is). We arrived at Slice’s at 12:30 or so which was absolutely the worst possible time. Apparently they must get a decent rush from the MATC crowd and we were right on its heels. The place was really busy but was surprisingly spacious and inviting. We grabbed a table and waited for the waitress to appear. Eventually we got sick of waiting and just went up to the bar to order our food and drinks.The lunch Fish fry consists of 4 pieces of Cod with fries for $5.25 which is seriously cheap. It came up fairly quickly after we ordered and was plenty hot. Unfortunately this is not what I would call a “homemade” Fish Fry. The filets were clearly pre-battered much like you get at the Glass Nickel or the Argus. It tasted okay but was slightly mushy and greasy which tends to happen when you get this kind of batter. It forms a shell which almost acts like a grease trap. It was still easily edible and the fact that you get 4 pieces for only $5.25 make it a seriously good value.The straight cut French fries were typical bar style and just right. The tartar was decent but a little dilly. This Fish Fry loses some points for the fact that they don’t give you any slaw or bread. I mean come on, I realize it is lunch but you can keep one of those four pieces if you throw me some slaw and a roll…deal? I assume for dinner you get the full Fish Fry experience and I will have to come back because their variety increases dramatically after 5pm. In addition to the Cod (which gets a bump to $9.25) they also have Walleye for $12.50 or Perch for $9.25 which I assume are “homemade” but can’t be sure.Overall this is just not a recommendable lunch Fish Fry. It was certainly decent but lacked several important components. Even if it is more than fair for the price it just doesn’t quite cut the mustard. Slice’s (NOT Slices’ as the sign above the bar might have you believe) seems like a great bar. For god sakes “Happy Hour” is four hours (2-6pm) which is actually longer that they serve breakfast in the morning, now that’s a bar. The rest of the fried food menu looked outstanding and that bar itself was very clean. I will certainly be back for beers sometime or a Friday Night Fish Fry. Unfortunately that ""slice"" landed their lunch Fish Fry in the bunker.Edit: As former Madison resident Eric G. mentioned ""...stick to the bottled beer. The tap beer is disgusting.""

That's what it's all about after all.The $10.25 5-piece is perfect for sharing and that's what the little man and I do every time now. The pieces are thin, but meaty, and he loves the light and clingy breading. His eating habits are getting more finicky, but I can always count on him downing at least one whole piece at Wilson's. He's also a fan of the fries, and while the freezer to fryer numbers are far from perfect, there are plenty to go around. In reality he doesn't care if their house-cut or freezer fries as long as they have plenty of salt on them...That's my boy! Two cups of thick and pungent tartar come with the 5-piece, and take the fish to the next level. There's so much in fact that enough usually sticks around for some French fry dipping afterwards. A retro version of Wilson's slaw brought back memories of the chalky mix of yesteryear this Friday, while Grandma's roll was just as soft and doughy as ever. When it comes to Fish Fry consistency is king, and while Wilson's might not be the best out there it's stays consistent week to week. It always has been (and we hope always will be) the same tasty Fry we have come to know and love.

Let's beat it...Of course, we've had the Fish Fry at Wilson's over 100 times so you know it has to at least be decent...and in our opinion it's much better than that. Today was a 5-piece with a 3 year old and was as classic as ever. The cod is lightly breaded with a superb amount of flavor. Its not the fall-apart flakiest fish in the world, but tastes pretty damn good to me. Tons of fries come with the 5-piece and are more than enough to share with a hungry little boy, while two full cups of the best tartar money can buy are all for dad. A couple soft and fresh dinner rolls get split evenly, and a much improved slaw has kicked the chalky stuff of yesteryear to the curb. Wilson's is just a tasty, no-nonsense Fish Fry and that makes me happy.

Ever since we first breeched the threshold and entered the LCD-laden mecca we were hooked on their Fish Fry. It is as consistent as they come, and never ever, have we had a subpar meal. More importantly, it has always been consistent – three 4 ounce-ish pieces of cod with all the standard accoutrements. It has never and will never change...or will it?The standard 3-piece for $7.25 is enough for any one man, but when you bring another half a man (in this case a two year old) the $9.50 5-piece makes more sense. As it were, we were expecting the same old fish (which would have been super), but to our amazement things had changed…and for the better no less. The once average-sized cuts are now massive sinewy fillets. The squat rectangles of yesterday have been replaced by long, lean fillets, but still with plenty of meat. The batter:fish ratio has gone up significantly, and when batter is the tasty that’s definitely a good thing. It’s still as “fried-chicken-like” as it used to be and 100% grease free. Hot oil and light breading equals pure bliss and this bit of cod garners our highest score ever for Wilson’s, proving change can be a good thing.That’s about where the change ends though, save for the real Hunts brand ketchup that has taken over for the generic hot dog stand stuff. The fries are what they’ve always been, although in such a gigantic portion they necessitated their own basket. While they were a little limp in spots, they were plentiful and satisfying for dad and little man alike.Two, count ‘em, two ½ oz Solo cups of tartar were used in their entirety. It’s so good and so thick, that wasting any of the creamy concoction would be a crime against the Fry. It truly is the standard by which all other tartars should be judged.Stop me if you’ve heard this before, but two, count ‘em, two dinner rolls came along for the journey. Some revamped slaw also lumbered along and was less chalky, and peppier than it used to be. It looks far more homemade and less Sysco standard than that of yesteryear.We’ve always loved Wilson’s, but our relationship had definitely stagnated after a decade. Leave it to the Randy and the missus to shake things up in the best of ways. The new cuts of cod are amazing and when you consider the price hasn’t budged it’s definitely a customer-savvy switch.

They never change and thats what we love about them.When you have former co-workers in the sports media industry meeting them for fish at Wilsons is a no-brainer. They love sports, Wilsons is arguably the best sports bar in town and also has a great little Fish Fry. Its a match made in heaven (or Wisconsin as it were).Travis, Norbert, and Laura from WisSports showed up about five minutes after I got there and Adam, of WIBA fame, rolled in about five minutes later. We shot the breeze for a moment and had our orders into the cook not long after. Three of the five of us went for the standard 3-piece, while Travis opted for the big fiver and Laura (gasp) opted for a grilled cheese. The fish fried quickly and we had lovely-looking plates in front of us in practically no time. Maybe we were just lucky or maybe members of the local sports media draw some serious water in this town, but whatever the case may be we all got an extra piece of fish on our plates. The 3-piecers became 4-piecers and the fivers became sixers. It was like a fishy Christmas in January for our hungry crew. Wilsons cod is as consistent as they come, and Id go so far as to call it mouth-watering. Its flaky enough, and while there may be a tough piece to chew through here and there, the breading brings it home every time. When paired with Wilsons thick and creamy tartar the solid starter is elevated into an All-Star caliber performer. A side of typical Julienne-cut fries come with the fish but are nothing really special. They tend to be a little on dry side, but always come in a big portion and pack a satisfying crunch. The yeasty dinner roll has always been a firm contributor to the lineup, but the same cant be said about the slaw. For years the creamy concoction was a chalky underperformer, but it appears to have finally come around. The revamped slugger had a pleasant flavor with plenty of pop and while its still not the best it has taken a huge leap forward and now actually belongs in the game. Sports, friends, and Fish Fry, whats not to love? Overall, we recommend the Fish Fry at Wilsons and if you catch us on the right day we might even say highly so. Its as solid as they come and while it might not win any championships its always worth the price of admission. www.wilsonssportsbarandgrill.com/2144 Atwood AvenueMadison, WI 53704     (608) 241-2226",2393,0.14296050203026944,0.4464451827242525

Everything is fried to order and comes your way lickety-split. While the cuts of cod seem to be slightly smaller than those of yore, they are no less delicious than their ancestors. They feature some of the most flavorful breading out there and flake apart effortlessly when bitten into. The fries come in droves, and while they arent (and never have been) anything to write home about they do what they need to do. Theyre a belly-filler, plain and simple. Wilsons tartar has always been a strong suit of their Fry and easily rivals the best supper club sauces out there. Its thick, its creamy, its just what the doctor ordered, and transforms the cod from very good to excellent. Like the fries, the roll and coleslaw are kind of ho-hum, but do what they need to do. We eat Fish Fry for the fish for the most part so as long as the bread and slaw make an appearance were okay with it. Sure Wilsons isnt fancy, but then again, if youre out for Fish and youre looking for fancy youve already failed. Overall, we recommend the Fish Fry at Wilsons and will continue to come back any time we want good fish at a great price. They just do it right no matter what some people say. www.wilsonssportsbarandgrill.com/2144 Atwood AvenueMadison, WI 53704     (608) 241-2226",2080,0.31839795918367353,0.5497063492063492

Almost every one of these occasions was during lunch, and in fact I think it may have been every single one now that I think about it. Every one before now that isI decided to give Wilsons a go for diner this Friday night, and I must say it was a totally different animal than what Ive found during the noon hour. Ive been to Wilsons on Badger game days, and it was busy. Ive been to Wilsons on Packer game days, and it was really busy. Ive even been to Wilsons on Brewer game days, and it was still pretty damn busy. But none of those days compared to how busy Wilsons was this Friday. It was nothing less than berserk. Apparently there was a Guys on Ice show at the Barrymore going on, and half of the audience-to-be stopped into the beloved sports bar for burgers beforehand. Every single seat was taken and there was a line for drinks at the bar which forced yours truly to the periphery. Eventually a couple got up from their stools and I quickly swooped in and grabbed one of the open seats. Luckily, Mack had seen me waiting my turn and put in my order well in advance me actually finding a seat, so my food was already in the queue once I sat down. I watched order after order of fish pass in front of me, and it took a good 30 minutes before my own 5-piece would be fried. At this point it was getting close to show time and the crowd was thinning out which meant my fish was served mere seconds after it was cooked. It was scalding hot and ready for my eager hands. I wasted no time. As per usual, the cod was on the money. The 5-piece was incredibly hearty and featured three regular pieces and two that were larger than average. The regulars chunks were good, but a couple had ends were a little chewy and difficult to pull apart, however, the two meatier chunks more than made up for it. This duo was moist and flaky, with a much more buttery flavor. All five shared the same light breading, which is perfectly spiced, and really makes the cod something special. Historically Wilsons fries havent been anything to write home about, and this batch wasnt any different. They were just fine, and adequately fried, but nothing unique. Luckily, Wilsons tartar is noteworthy and justifies all the praise we have heaped upon it. It is smooth and creamy, with a remarkable zip that pushes the cod skyward and perks up the pedestrian potatoes. And the best part? When you upgrade to the 5-piece you get two full cups instead of the regular one. God bless you, Mr. Wilson. God bless you. The supporting actors in Wilsons fishy production play their roll adequately, but are far from skilled thespians. The coleslaw usually butchers its part, but was less chalky and more alluring than usual while the dinner roll is to this Fish Fry as Colin Farrell is to Hollywood -- solid, but far from Oscar worthy. After 100+ visits to Wilsons there isnt much they could do to change our minds about their Fish Fry. It is just incredibly solid, and flourishes on the strength of their savory cod and tremendous tartar sauce. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry, and will come back anytime, whether its for lunch or dinner, and we wont give a damn how long we have to wait to get it. Wilsons is our place, and always will be. www.wilsonssportsbarandgrill.com/2144 Atwood AvenueMadison, WI 53704     (608) 241-2226",3388,0.14797507265817123,0.45973335740941373

Heres why  Theres no BS at Wilsons. The fish will come no more than five minutes after your order goes in and will be smoking hot - you might even get an extra piece (Travis and Norbet both did). The fish is as consistent as any you will find. It is the same thing every Friday and features a fried chicken-like batter that is light and flaky with just the right amount of seasoning for cod. The breading is also incredibly clingy, and really holds the flaky fish together. Quite superb. The fries are supple and tasty, not over-fried like they used to be from time to time. While they arent the best youll ever have they play their part and dont overshadow the fish. The tartar is everything a sauce should be. It is triumphantly thick, incredibly creamy, and massively delicious. It makes the cod even better than it is on its own (and its pretty damn good on its own). The slaw and roll are there. The slaw is fresh, but still not zesty enough, while the roll is soft and yeasty. They do what they need to do. In a nutshell, Wilsons is great because they arent trying to be. They are just doing what they do without trying to make things too fancy or too unique. Overall, we highly recommend the Fish Fry at Wilsons.

The storied establishment rarely changes things up which in turn leads to consistently great Fish Frys.

Each juicy chunk of cod boasts Wilsons signature breading which is superbly seasoned and clings to slick fish with Herculean strength  no un-breaded bites here.

The current coleslaw is also much better than it used to be. It is now a more finely chopped and diverse mix, and while it still has the same slightly chalky flavor it wasnt as overpowering as in days past. The roll this time around was slightly different and seemed to be some sort of multi-grain or wheat rather than just the regular white. While it was a little gritty, they are clearly trying to change things for the better and effort certainly counts. Once again Wilsons did the job they set out to do.

At Wilsons the cod is always great, and the tartar borders on perfection. A fairly priced 3-piece costs $8 in 2012, but the fish will be flaky and moist  well worth the price. When paired with the creamy, zesty tartar, they overshadow any other shortcomings in the meal (which are unfortunately numerous). Try as they might, Wilsons just cant seem to crest French Fry Mountain. While they are almost there the Julienne fries are oft under-fried, sometimes over-fried, but never seem to hit the crispy center. The creamy coleslaw also wavers around the target, but never hits the bulls-eye. It lacks the zest of the best, even though the consistency is dead on. A freshly baked roll rounds out this Fry, and helps take some pressure of the fish. The pillowy buns are soft and supple and make fine little fish sandwiches if youre into that sort of thing.Wilsons may not wow you, but they are the true essence of what Fish Fry is all about - simple, straight-forward, and fish-centric.

One, we would be watching it. Two, we would be eating fish. And three, we would be doing those two things in the same place. Of course, the place we chose was Wilsons  not a given, but about as close as you can get.I arrived at the old stomping grounds before the rest of the team, and took a spot at the bar. Since the rest of my crew wasnt due to arrive until game time and werent planning on eating, I decided to pay the admission right away, and get the pre-game grub out of the way. With the start of the new season ticket prices have apparently gone up and a chance at the dish will now cost you a full eight bucks ($9.50 for the 5-piece). My plate was up in mere minutes and I set about emptying it immediately. As per usual I ripped into the cod first and foremost and was greeted with steam. The fish was simply delicious, as it always seems to be, a .300 hitter all the way. Each of the three pieces was flaky, moist, and supremely handlable (Im not sure if thats a word, but thats what Im going with). Its tactile nature was due in large part to Wilsons signature breading which is so thin and clingy, that its a bit of a marvel unto itself. This is great fish, the kind you could see yourself eating every Friday in fact, we did just thatfor a good four years or so.Next at the dish were the latest incarnation of Wilsons fries. This new slugger is a bit beefier and thicker-cut than its predecessor with the potential to do some serious damage, but to our dismay they are clearly still a work in progress. Today they came in a little limp and under-fried, but you could see the youngsters potential and could tell that better days are ahead.Unlike the unseasoned spuds, the tartar was the consummate professional and took everyones game to the next level. This sauce is what it is all about. Its thick, creamy, and zesty; exactly what every tartar should aspire, and the kind of teammate every fish desires.  Wilsons standard dinner roll batted cleanup, and was exceptionally soft and fresh. Like the tartar it was a true team player, although it did its duty to little fanfare. Also receiving little acclaim, but this time justly, was the latest call up in Wilsons everlasting search for slaw. The latest rook was more diverse than previous slaws, but still had a chalky flavor that was just not quite right. Oh well, sometimes its the effort that counts, and they are clearly giving it their all. While the Brewers would go on to lay an egg on opening day, Madison Fish Fry one out of the park. Hey, .500 aint bad What can I say? I knew the Big W wouldnt lead us astray and they certainly did not. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry, and even if its gone up another $0.75 it is still well worth every last penny. www.wilsonssportsbarandgrill.com/2144 Atwood AvenueMadison, WI 53704     (608) 241-2226",2931,0.10945867768595038,0.48956500065590974

We went to Wilsons again Look, sometimes on Friday we just want a quick-n-dirty Fish Fry, and not some big production. It is times like this we go to Wilsons.Solo trips to Wilsons require a seat at the bar, and a bottle of beer. No more than a few sips into the High Life and I had a steaming hot Fish Fry set in front of me  fish shouldnt take that long to fry, you see. It was classic Wilsons. The pieces were a little bigger than average, but just delicious as ever. The hunks were meaty and flaky, and paired perfectly with Wilsons light and spicy breading.Wilsons fries are hit and miss (mostly miss), but this time they hit (not the bullseye, but a good clean hit nonetheless). They came in droves and were well-fried, which isnt always the case. Any lackluster cuts were perked up by Wilsons homemade tartar which is all-around perfect, and makes fish and French fry alike so much more. Dinner rolls are shipped in Friday AM so you know they are soft and fresh, and when the butter is room temp (it isnt always) things are even nicer. Wilsons revolving slaw recipe landed on a winner today and the oft bland mix was diverse, crispy, and homemade. It was not objectionable in any way, which is actually saying quite a bit when it come to slaw roulette at Wilsons.Another trip to Wilsons, another delicious Fish Fry.

When it come to nearly every other restaurant in Madison you could say the same about Madison A to Z. Nicole and JM (the gurus behind the well respected blog) have been just about everywhere, and when they messaged us inquiring about a(nother) Fish Fry date, we were powerless to resist their charms. Back in March we escorted the delightful duo on their excursion to Tobys and had a great time in doing so. These are a couple smart cookies and we had blast BSing with them on our first meeting. This time around I knew it would be just as much fun, if not more so, since Gabe is back in action and quite an astute gent in his own right. MFF and A to Z, it would seem, are a perfect match.Our fishly contingent arrived at Wilsons at noon, and grabbed one of the 6-person high-top tables like we always do. A to Z rolled in shortly thereafter, and joined the four of us. Unfortunately, the ever-reliable Mack was nowhere to be seen (suspected to be in St. Louie for the Brewers-Cardinals game) and it took much longer than normal for his stand-in to swing by. Eventually he came over, dropped some menus (now with anti-theft devices, no joke), and ran to get us a round of drinks. When he came back with the beverages our orders went in  mostly 3-piece Fish Frys, with Nicole opting for the eponymous Wilson Burger.As per usual, the fish came in about 10, minutes and was scalding hot - as its supposed to be. The three pieces were the standard Wilsons fare, and the meaty hunks were as delicious as ever. They featured Wilsons signature light, crumbly breading, and were COMPLETELY devoid of grease while not being dried out. We simply love this stuff, thats all there is to it.Pairing perfectly with the consummate cod was Wilsons thick, creamy tartar. This splendid sauce compliments the fish so well that youll think youve died and gone to heaven, or Davy Jones locker, if you will. I often wonder if tartar sauce can get any better than this, and the more I do, then less I think it can. Wilsons simply owns the sauce. You know we love Wilsons, and from outward appearances it seemed like the fish impressed A to Z too. Unfortunately, today Wilsons fries took a step back, impressing no one. The matchstick-style fries were under-fried, totally lifeless, and detracted from the overall glory of the Fish Fry. While they were still better than those of yore, they were a far cry from the best of the best, leaving all at the table unimpressed. Doh! Speaking of dough, the tear-off dinner roll was as starchy and delicious as ever. It was soft and hearty, and complimented the fish/tartar combo with its delicate texture. If there is one thing that has always been a letdown at Wilsons it is the coleslaw. Never in all our visits have we enjoyed the homemade blend and its strangely bland bonding agent. Well, lo and behold, times they are a-changin and we were treated to a whole new rendition of the cabbag-y concoction this time around. The updated slaw was creamy and zesty, and seemed to be heavier on the shredded carrot. It was a total 180, and the consensus at the table was that this was Wilsons finest effort to date. Wilsons is also infamous for leaving their ketchup out indefinitely, which leads to it being a tart, vinegar-y disaster. Well, maybe we got lucky, or maybe theyve finally caught on, but this time Gabes favorite condiment was thicker, more consistent and actually tasted like ketchup. It was a bit of a miracle, and Im not fully ready to say theyve figured it out for good, but things are looking up. Well test it again our next trip to be sureThis is still one of our favorite little Fish Frys and we are glad we got to share it with two of Madtowns finest in Nicole and JM. Overall, we recommend the Fish Fry at Wilsons and will be back time and again until they give us a good reason not to. And who knows?

The three good sized chunks were hot as can be when served and simply great, just as we expected they would be. The glacier white cuts were pristine, and fall apart flaky. They featured Wilsons outstanding breading which houses just the right amount of spice. Mmm mmm mmm. Wilsons new style of fries piled on the succulence as the skin-on, Julienne cut potatoes were fried just right. The portion was huge and while there were a few odd balls in the bunch, the overall quality was much better than the fries of old. Thick, mayo-rich tartar is the name of the game around these part and Wilsons is an ace. I have always thought it was a homemade concoction, but the old dudes that were portioning out the servings made me think otherwise. They were dumping it from a very Sysco-looking jug, into a beer pitcher, then into the individual solo cups, so now Im not sure what to think. Regardless of the source, the sassy sauce still tasted wonderful and took the fish to the next level.That old Wilsons roll came along ride and while it wasnt stale or anything it was just the same old same old. The pat of butter that came with didnt help much since it was fresh from fridge, making it practically unusable. The slaw was also not very user friendly, and even though I got to watch her whip it up from scratch I wouldnt call this recipe a winner.  She basically just ripped open a couple bags of pre-shredded cabbage and carrots and dumped them together. While this sounds fail proof, the goo she used to congeal it came up short. Whatever this thickener happens to be, it totally lacks zest and just doesnt produce a tasty slaw.Overall, this still the same classic Fish Fry we have come to know and love, and we recommend it without reservation.Friend of friends, reliable and true.

You know the kind Im talking about. More than likely your dad and/or grandpa drove one from the day he bought it (with cash) until the day he died, and never once considered trading it in for something newer or flashier.  Sure, theres guaranteed to be a few dents and dings, it probably has more rust than metal left on the body, and it has definitely been there and back, but these trustworthy trucks always get the job done. Unheralded autos like these serve their purpose without drawing a bunch of unwanted attention, and when Friday rolls around sometimes we want a Fish Fry that does the same. In these instances we often turn to Wilsons, the beater pickup of Fish Frys.Reese and I swung the old jalopy into Wilsons parking lot just as the clock stuck noon and I was not the least bit surprised that the entire thing full except for one small space that most cars couldnt be crammed into. Luckily for us, the small car we currently cavort in had no problem squeezing in, and with that, Wilsons lot was filled to the brim. We scurried inside to escape the cold, and immediately found a table amongst the many available. Wilsons superior server, Mac, was for Dallas at the Super Bowl this Friday, and a couple young bucks were filling fish orders in his stead. One of them scooted right over, detailed our desires and brought us some beverages to get our engines primed. We waited no more than three minutes, and like magic, the fish appeared before us. It was alarmingly fast, in fact, I think I heard it do a burnout on its way over.The small ovular plate that hosts Wilsons Fish Fry performs a delicate balancing act and somehow manages to make it all fit in. Unveiling the tartar requires you to move your roll; likewise, in order to see the slaw, a lemon wedge must be cast aside. Once these items have been relocated, all that remains is to pop the lids on the solo cups and go to work, and believe me, I wasted no time removing the ragtops.Usually I cant help myself, and bore into the fish first and foremost, but today I took a different route. The fish was too hot to handle so I decided to let it idle for a bit while I took a run at the slaw and roll. As per usual the slaw was bone-stock, and the roll needed to be suped-up with a little butter, but by and large they did what they needed to do. After a couple bites, I refocused my attention on the fish. As always, the cod was spot on. The light and flaky fish was incredibly hot (as youd imagine it would be after being ready in only three minutes), and surprisingly moist. The spicy breading (reportedly made by a company called Mies) was superb and mingled with the small pieces of cod like a dream. Wilsons tartar was the perfect bolt-on, and helped push the cod into overdrive. The thick and zesty sauce is a personal favorite, and while it comes in a tiny cup, the good folks at Wilsons are always happy to bring you another (free of charge, of course).Like a beater truck, this Fish Fry is not without its flaws. The French fries this go-round were not quite as good as they have been recently, nor were there very many of them to go around. They were fairly well fried, but just werent very tasty. Wilsons slaw also didnt add any horsepower to the Fish Fry, as the creamy concoction just has a funny taste, and mostly went to waste. As I plowed the fish and fries through my intake manifold, I noticed that I was pulling away from Reese and then some. I practically crossed the finish line before he even got into second gear, taking the checkered flag with ease. Overall, this was another successful trip to Wilsons, and we have no problem recommending their Friday special. The cod is one mean machine, and when you fill the tank with Wilsons homemade tartar it really puts the hammer down. As with any old truck, while the engine runs fine most of the time, there are bound to be a few hiccups, and the fries definitely backfired today. Rattletraps like these never come fully loaded, and the slaw and roll are certainly not the equivalent of power windows, but then again they dont need to be to get the job done. One of these days Im going to get around to purchasing a beater truck of my own, and when I do, I will make sure to drive it to Wilsons on Fridays. I mean, it just makes sense, doesnt it? www.wilsonssportsbarandgrill.com/2144 Atwood AvenueMadison, WI 53704     (608) 241-2226",4438,0.1977744310575636,0.5482788296041309

Whether you are talking about horseshoes, parenting or bowling, it is mastering the little repetitive motions that separate the wheat from the chaff. In our book, preparing a Fish Fry is no different. We expect that if we have a Fish Fry somewhere then go back to the same place we are going to encounter a similar meal each and every time. Wilsons Bar and Grill is a picture of consistency and we consider their fish to be as rock solid as they come.Gabe and I rolled into the Atwood mainstay just before the lunch hour expired, and were not the least bit surprised to see almost every chair in the place occupied. We scrounged up a high top table and waited for Mack to swing on by. As soon as he did we hit him with our orders and he shuffled off to drop them by The Mrs. In typical Wilsons fashion, the food was ready about 7 minutes later and looked as good as ever when we first laid eyes on it. I quickly brushed aside a few fries, popped the lid on my tarter, and probed the sauce with my cod. At first taste it was clear, this was classic Wilsons. Each of the three meaty fillets were perfectly fried and covered in Wilsons light and flaky batter. The cod and batter combination is truly a flavor for the ages, and when paired with Wilsons tartar, makes for an undeniably awesome experience. Wilsons tartar is basically perfect, and has never once swayed from the homemade recipe, save for the couple of months that they received a bunch of free stuff from a local KFC (that was awful). While the fish and tartar are steady as a rock, the French fries always seem to be a bit of a guessing game. This time around they were still serving their updated skin-on Julienne cut numbers, but they were woefully undercooked, leaving them limp and somewhat flavorless. Im not sure what Wilsons deal is, but if they could get the fries on par with the fish it would be to everyones benefit.Much like the unpredictable fries we received this visit, the coleslaw was also sadly lacking. While it is dependable as all get out, the only thing you can rely on is that it wont taste good. The creamy mixture is just not very flavorful and could really use some Miracle Whip or something to kick it up a notch. As it stands, it is just really bland and cabbage-y, and although it is comparable week to week, that isnt necessarily a good thinig.  Wilsons does do Fish Fry right by offering a soft, spongy dinner roll with every meal. This visit it was extra delicate and really added a nice texture change between bites of flaky fish and soggy fries. Overall, this was another triumph for Wilsons. Each and every visit you are assured of: fabulous fish, tasty tartar, a dandy dinner roll, and crummy coleslaw. In addition, you get to play the guessing game that is Wilsons French fries. We still love Wilsons and although we dont make it as regularly as we used to, we still are managing to get there from time to time for their fantastic Friday Fish Fry. In a world where consistency counts, Wilsons just seems to add up. www.wilsonssportsbarandgrill.com/2144 Atwood AvenueMadison, WI 53704     (608) 241-2226",3138,0.10910273368606704,0.494750486139375

I mean, heck, we worked right down the street, and when presented with the opportunity to get a 3-piece Fish Fry for $6.25 each and every Friday, it was the obvious choice. Since changing jobs the choice has become a little hazier for us. Sure the fish is still great, but then again, a lot of other places have great fish too. Plus, since our departure, they have bumped the price up a notch to $7.50 which isnt a huge difference, but enough of a deterrent to make us think twice about making the trek across town. Since the portion size of the 3-piece is just about right for lunch, and I wasnt looking for a huge meal, I asked Jer if he was down for a rekindling of our relationship with Wilsons. You know he was. We swung by the Atwood mainstay about noon and bellied right up to the bar. Since I was skipping my afternoon of work I decided to pair my 3-piece with a longneck of High Life. Mack served it right up and dropped our orders off with Mrs. Wilson. We took in a few pre-season football highlights and within 5 minutes our cod concoction was complete. As was my standard practice in the days of yore, I popped the tartar open and plunged one of my three Wisemen into it immediately. The taste of the flaky cod, and delicious batter hit me instantly, transferring my mortal body into a state of fry induced euphoria. I quickly polished off the first piece and looked down to notice that it and its counterparts seemed to be much larger than they used to be. Well done, Wilson. Well done.Wilsons has pulled a fast one on your old friend MFF. Since losing our Friday-regular status, Wilsons has changed their once lackluster fries into something much better. The skin-on, Julienne cut fries they are offering now stand head and shoulders above their predecessors and even though they were slightly undercooked, were still much better than the old style. Unfortunately, they cant be improved with a thick dousing of ketchup since Wilsons keeps their ketchup on the table nonstop which leads to it being a vinegary mess. Oh well, crummy ketchup does not a Fish Fry ruin.All things tomato aside, the tartar more than made up for any shortcomings in the sauce department. Wilsons tartar is simply perfect. It is smooth and creamy, with the ideal mayo-relish balance. If there is any failing (and that is a big if), it is that the single solo cup is barely enough to stand up to the three generous cod fillets. Madison Fish Fry is a bit of a tartar whore, you see.Like the ketchup, the slaw at Wilsons is just a bit off. While vinegar isnt the culprit, someones taste buds must be. This slaw is the same old same old, and just is not appetizing in any way. The plain old white dinner roll is also nothing special, but at least it is there and doesnt gross me out like the slaw seems to. Wilsons is still a no-brainer. Even though our location has changed, Wilsons is still the same as it ever was, a few minor tweaks aside. The cod and tartar are simply delectable while the improved fries are exactly what this Fish Fry needed. Sure the bread is just okay, and the slaw is kind of blah, but at least they are there, and who knows, maybe other people like them that way? As far as Madison Fish Fry is concerned this is one easily recommendable Fish Fry and we will be back time and again. If you are racking your brain trying to think of where you should go on Friday, this is one Fish Fry that will put your mind at ease. We wuv Wilsons, you should too. www.wilsonssportsbarandgrill.com/2144 Atwood AvenueMadison, WI 53704     (608) 241-2226",3600,0.13724439775910358,0.4520559056956116

When you speak in such a way it glosses over the small details and categorizes many discrete, often times, highly dissimilar things into one vast group. By stereotyping things in this way we actually narrow our world view, and can unintentionally offend people who disagree with what we are saying. Basically, broad generalizations are for idiots. Especially risky are making generalizations about sensitive topics like Fish Fry. In the past we have said that Wilsons is the standard by which all other Fish Frys should be judged. While it is not a perfect Fry by any means, it is an adequate baseline by which to base all other observations. Plus, we have eaten it so many times it is easy to recall the quality and use it as our measuring stick. There is nothing quite like a Wilsons Fish Fry.We popped into Schenk-Atwood mainstay around 11:30 and were pleasantly surprised that the Fish Fry crowd had yet to arrive. We grabbed a table and Garys daughter came over a couple seconds later with some menus. Pshaw, we said, we dont need no stinkin menus! We want some Fish Fry and a piece of that bacon, Jer chimed in (they had just made a couple large panfulls, presumably for bacon cheeseburgers and the like). Not even cracking a smile, the young lady immediately shot him down and scurried away as quickly as she could to give our orders to the cook. Chicks whose dads own bars have serious attitudes. We enjoyed a couple brewskis and a few minutes later our napkins were ready. I say napkins because apparently that is how Gabes co-workers refer to the Wilsons Fish Fry since it is usually served on one to absorb any excess grease. For some reason today they were napkin-less, but Fish Fry served on a napkin is always better than fish not served on a napkin. While I have come to expect the cod to be good, today it was excellent. The batter was super light and flaky as was the cod itself. There was not a single spot of grease present so the napkin was a moot point anyway. Since we were the first fish eaters of the day it was cooked to order and served scalding hot. If you are a cod aficionado you cant do better than Wilsons, however if you are a French fry fan you should steer clear of Wilsons version of Russian roulette.As difficult as it is for me to say, usually the fries at Wisons suck. They are often times double fried, or just undercooked which makes them less than desirable. However, today it was a different story, and the fries were absolutely great. Instead of the thin, overly crispy, tuber chunks of yore, these babies were a thick, Julienne cut, and fried perfectly. Wilsons has turned a corner. These fires were so good I would say they are almost on par with the classic Wilsons tartar sauce which is probably the best around. The ketchup, on the other hand, is a different story. This stuff apparently never gets recycled in any way, and the vinegary concoction is spine-tingling nasty. It is simply the worst. Luckily for them we dont have a Ketchup Score. The bread served is a dinner roll which is as average as they come but at least it comes. I am sick of places cheaping-out on the bread and offering Fish-n-Chips style fish. This is Wisconsin; we expect bread at ever meal, especially at a Fish Fry. I dont care if it is noon or 9PM, we need bread to live. No bread = not a Fish Fry.While I am not a huge fan of the slaw, and dont put too much stock in it, I at least have to make sure it is edible. The Wilsons slaw is, but barely. It is a creamy mix, but is just not tasty, and while the portion is actually pretty generous mine mostly goes to waste. Coleslaw is great, if you are poor.Overall, this Fish Fry is easy to recommend any old day, but this experience was above and beyond. The vastly improved fries really help to put it over the top, while not stealing the attention from the fish. True, said fries can be hit and miss, but the cod is consistently good, especially when coupled with the best tartar in the city. Not skimping on bread and slaw also helps to push this meal closer to greatness, while the small-town style of service is very inviting and atypical in Madison. This is one well rounded meal and the best thing since sliced bread.I hope you read this with the hint of sarcasm which was intended and noted the many broad generalizations made throughout. I love broad generalizations, and since I choose to write in a very colloquial style, I try to use them as often as I can. It is mostly because they tend to be humorous, but often hold true if you look at the big picture.

You know the ones, they might smell a little funky, and they dont look like a million bucks, but they are just too comfortable to ignore. When you slip them on your feet actually feel better, they add a spring to your step and put you in a better mood. I found my old sneakers recently, and it just so happens that the same day I threw them on was the same day I decided to make the trip to Wilsons Bar and Grill: the comfy old sneakers of the Fish Fry world.I basically try to take advantage of each and every opportunity afforded me, which means Friday lunch and dinner are both fair game. Since most places focus their efforts on the dinner crowd, lunch often gets overlooked. In fact, Im sure less than half of places that do Fish Fry for dinner have a lunch special as well. Wilsons has been a long time favorite for this exact reason, they do the same thing for lunch that they do for dinner, and they do it damn well. The 3-piece Icelandic Cod at Wilsons will run you $7.50, which is a fair deal, but nothing like it used to be at $6.25. I arrived around 12:30, settled into my bar stool, and got comfortable. When the bartender came over I gave him my fish order and went with a High Life since the tap beer has been hit and miss in the past. I have eaten the Fish Fry here well over 100 times, but never sat as close to the fryer as I did on this visit. I actually got to watch my food get cooked which gave me a few insights into why Wilsons tastes the way it does.It took about 5 minutes for my fish to emerge from the fryer and make its way to me. As per usual, I grabbed one of the steaming hot pieces of cod and went right at it. When the cook was making the fish I noticed that the fillets seemed larger than they used to be. When I got my hands on them I realized they definitely are. These fillets were very meaty compared to what we used to get. They were also very tasty, and probably a little better than I remembered. My three lightly coated chunks were steaming hot until the last bite. By the end the fish had accumulated a tiny bit of grease, but even these greasy morsels were delicious.As comfortable as I have gotten with Wilsons it is in no thanks to their French fries. Usually they are over fried and just not enticing, I think today I may have uncovered the reason why. When I sat down there were some fries ready to go in the bassket, unfortunately there was no one for them to go to. Then right before my fish was ready she gave them another blast in the fryer to reheat them. Ah ha! It is the double frying! I finally had an explanation for the mediocrity and the inconsistency in Wilsons fries. Thankfully the tartar is probably some of the absolute best out there and can be relied on time and again. It is thick and creamy with just the perfect amount of sweetness. It works wonders with the fish and even makes the overly crispy fries edible.Like the tattered soles on my sneakers the plain Jane white roll was soft and squishy. Its pillow-y texture complimented the flaky fish perfectly. The slaw was also highly complimentary and while it wasnt zesty, it was creamy and did what it needed to do to complete the puzzle.Overall, I feel comfortable recommending the Fish Fry at Wilsons. The fish and tartar are simply great and the rest of the meal rounds out just fine. However, make sure you come on Friday because they have fried fish on the every day menu which is not their Fish Fry. The Fish Fry is special, and worth waiting for. As my sneakers ushered me away from yet another visit to Wilsons I couldnt help but think just because something is broken in, doesnt mean it is broken down. After over 100 visits to Wilsons I think I can safely say I have their Fish Fry broken in, time to sit back and enjoy the ride. www.wilsonssportsbarandgrill.com/2144 Atwood AvenueMadison, WI 53704     (608) 241-2226",3963,0.14436559472273763,0.4565517419088849

Not long turned out to be the very next opportunity for Fish Fry since I had some business to attend to in the Atwood area anyway. I arrived at Wilson’s at about 12:30 or so and waited for a couple friends to show up from their office downtown. As I waited I enjoyed my long neck of High Life and watched a little SportsCenter. They showed not long after and we put in our orders – 4, 3-piece. As always the fish was ready within 5-7 minutes of ordering and was scalding hot when he set it down. The light, flaky cod was superb even if it didn’t come served on a napkin as it almost always does. My last piece was still steaming as I finished it off (granted that was only about 3 minutes after I got it but when the fish is this good I can’t just let it sit, it must be eaten, NOW!). The 3-piece used to run $6.25 and has since been bumped to $7.50. Last week I postulated that the $1.25 price hike might be due to new, higher quality fries. This week I was proven wrong as it appears the fries were back to the same old same old, which are fine but not what I was hoping for.Wilson’s still has the best tartar out there and a slaw that is just fine. The roll was not as warm as it was last week either but still did the job.After last week I thought I might be coming back to Wilson’s every Friday. This week brought me back to Earth a little bit. This is still a great lunch time Fish Fry but not the best as I was almost tempted to say last week. Wilson’s isn’t always the most consistent across the board but the fish is always great and that is really what is most important.www.wilsonssportsbarandgrill.com/2144 Atwood AvenueMadison, WI 53704     (608) 241-2226",1753,0.21020775941230488,0.3911007805325987

For reasons we won’t go into here, it had been a while since my last Wilson’s Fish Fry. I knew I needed to pay them a visit sometime soon and the Friday of June 5th turned out to be that day.I was able to skip out from our neighborhood rummage sale and slide over to Wilson’s at about 12:30. I grabbed a stool at the bar and waited for Mack to come grab my order. The Fish Fry at Wilson’s used to be $6.25 for a 3-piece and $7.50 for a 5-piece but has recently been raised to $7.50 and $9.00 respectively.  I was curious if this was just a function of the economy or if they actually did something different to the Fish Fry. In the end I think it was a little bit of both. I went for the 3-piece and ordered a High Life since I have had mixed results with the tap Spotted Cow in the past. The fish came in about 5 minutes and was everything I remembered, and more.My three fair sized cod filets were just delicious. Wilson’s uses a light batter and fries their fish to near perfection resulting in compact, solid pieces that are great finger food. The homemade tartar that comes with is also superb and compliment the fish without taking center stage. The fish has always been consistently good but this may have been about the best it has ever been for me (or maybe I have just been away for too long). When I was all done the napkin under the fish is had nary a grease spot to be found.The fries at Wilson’s were always hit and miss, but this time they definitely hit and almost bowled me over to boot. They were straight cut potatoes (as the always have been) but these had the skin on and seemed to be less starchy than I remember. They were hot, well fried and more than plentiful. Perhaps this is the reason for the price hike? If so, I am all for it.The slaw was fine and seems to be the same as it ever was (insert Talking Heads beat here). The roll was also the same ole-same ole but now served warm which I like a lot more than a lifeless cold bun. Tons of TV’s with sports on every one of ‘em, fruit machines & bar games and regulars everywhere are what you can expect at Wilson’s. Overall I was more impressed with this visit to Wilson’s than any other I have had. The food was even better than I remember, the service was speedy and friendly and Wilson’s is still Wilson’s. I was clearly spoiled by having such a great Fish Fry so conveniently located and will now have to make conscious efforts to get to Wilson’s as often as I can.www.wilsonssportsbarandgrill.com/2144 Atwood AvenueMadison, WI 53704     (608) 241-2226",2591,0.23780797101449275,0.4798550724637681

Wilson's gets cod special on Friday which is different than the cod you can get any other day. The cod is always done well, not great, but always good. You have a choice between the 3 piece for $6.25 of the 5 piece for slightly more. The three piece is more than adequate for lunch-time. The batter is always light and the fish is consistently good. Today was no exception, the fish was spot on. The fries are usually very average but today I would say they were even worse. One of the best things at Wilson's is their homemade tartar sauce, among the best I have found. The roll is always the same and just fine, never warm but always tasty.

Wilson's gets cod special on Friday which is different than the cod you can get any other day. The cod is always done well, not great, but always good. You have a choice between the 3 piece for $6.25 of the 5 piece for slightly more. The three piece is more than adequate for lunch-time. The batter is always light and the fish is consistently good. The fries are usually very average. One of the best things at Wilson's is their homemade tartar sauce, among the best I have found. The roll is always the same and just fine, never warm but always tasty. The coleslaw is decent as far a slaw goes. I love the service at Wilson's and the fact that there are always sports to watch on any of their 10,000 TVs (I exaggerate, but they do have a lot of TVs).

JBs is one of those places that claims to offer a better Friday Fish Fry and when assertions like that are thrown around you just know there are going to be those out there who actually believe them. Since we need to have the lowdown when people ask if a place like JBs worth trying or not, we decided to bite the bullet and pay them a visit.  I was briefly optimistic as we pulled into the parking lot at the Sun Prairie nightspot since it was almost full, which usually means a busy Fish Fry (busy Fish Frys are usually good Fish Frys, you see). Unfortunately, we got hoodwinked and the part of the lot we pulled into was the bar-adjacent side which skewed our perception and made JBs seem far busier than they actually were. Any optimism faded quickly once we got inside and passed the crowded bar only to find the hostess station deserted. Eventually someone came by, scooped us up (knocked over a bunch of stuff in the process), and found us a booth in the sparsely populated dining room. It took a while for our apathetic waitress to finally come over, which gave us ample time to look over JBs three Fish Fry options.I was tempted to try the walleye and coaxed by the cod, but I stuck to my guns and ordered $10.50 lake perch I had planned on. It took while for the food to arrive, but it was nice and hot when it did. Only four small fillets comprised the order and while they tasted good there were just not enough of them. The quartet was cloaked in a breading that was a little thicker than average and I would say almost bordered on a batter/breading hybrid. The perch cocoon had a nice flavor and complimented the moist and flaky fish pretty well, actually. The fish was pretty flavorful, but loses some points for swimming in such a small school.Offsetting the pintsized portion of perch was a French fry feast. The classic freezer fries were the thick-cut Julienne variety, complete with skin and all. Suspected to be straight from Sysco, the pervasive potato product paired perfectly alongside the thick and creamy tartar sauce, which also appeared to adhere to the Sysco standard. An above average multigrain bun joined the party and brought a side of coleslaw as its date. The sassy slaw had a horseradish kick, and played ever so lovingly with the soft buns, making for a very PG-13 moment (which aren't all that rare at JBs judging by the scantly clad cocktail waitresses). You know, when it comes right down to it, the food really wasnt all that bad, but there were certainly some glaring issues with JBs in general. If our waitress would have come back, even one time, between dropping the food and bringing the check, it might have helped. If there were more than four skimpy fish for my ten-fifty, it might have helped. If literally anything would not have been Sysco, it might have helped. Then again it might not have too. Oh well... Overall, we cant recommend this Fish Fry, and likely wont be back to JBs any time soon - well, maybe for a drink someday, but thats probably about it. www.jbsitaliangrille.com/1086 Emerald TerraceSun Prairie, WI 53590     (608) 837-6016",3144,0.10107442348008386,0.4941075172207247
http://madisonfishfry.com/reviews.php?restaurant=211,http://madisonfishfry.com/reviews.php?restaurant=211&event=792,2013-03-22,Mulligan's Bar & Grill,"Overall, I would recommend this Fish Fry.",Good,Good,Excellent,Good,Good,"Mulligans is one of those places. It really isnt all that unique, the food isnt all that special, yet the locals love it and seemingly go out of their way to oversell it. Weve heard time and again that their Fish Fry is one of the best around, and time and again weve failed to verify those claims. Every time we have found the same thing - it is a fine Fish Fry, but it is far from the best out there, even if it really draws a crowd. About half of the populace of Oregon seemed to be at Mulligans this Friday, and even though our friends Stan and Megan showed up at 7:00 and put us on the list, we still had a decent wait. Our party of seven didnt get a table until 7:40 or so, but thats a big group so the wait was understandable. What wasnt as understandable was the inattentive service at the bar. Even though the bar was adequately staffed, it took forever for us to get someones attention and grab a drink. This is apparently not that uncommon at the Mulligans, and although we ultimately did get our drinks, we certainly would have had another round at the bar had we gotten the first one faster. Eventually we were seated at our table in the stage-left (bar-right) dining room, and given menus. Our long table was clad with a vinyl shamrock-print tablecloth, some dinnerware, and the standard condiment caddies. The waitress presiding over the room came by a few minutes later, took our orders, and scurried off to get us the second round that we never got at the bar. She returned with our booze, at which point she informed me that walleye Id ordered was sold out. My only other option was the AYCE beer battered cod which is what pretty much everyone else ordered. Before the fish arrived, Mulligans trotted out our side dishes and some French bread. For my side I chose the coleslaw over the clam chowder and it was creamy and rich. It had a little zip and a smooth consistency that paired well with the small slice of fresh bread. The fish, fries, and tartar came about 15 minutes later, and looked most unimpressive on the small plate. It was all just kind of there, and while it didnt look awful, it didnt scream Come and get me! Each of the AYCE portions started with two small pieces of fish which necessitated us requesting six more pieces immediately. This first round was not steaming hot which made it less than ideal (the second batch would prove to be much hotter and much more satisfying). The beer batter was incredibly light and was almost more like a breading than a batter. It had a nice seasoning that paired well with the flaky, but firm cod. It also housed very little, if any, grease and was somewhat reminiscent of our beloved Wilsons, although not quite that good. The AYCE cod was paired with a tantalizing tartar that was nothing less than outstanding. It was incredibly thick and creamy, with a bunch of mayo, and a just enough relish to keep things interesting. The fries kept less of our attention as the freezer-to-fryer, skin-on spuds were just Sysco so-so.  Mulligans is clearly the go-to Fish Fry in Oregon, but thats mostly because there isnt a lot of competition for that crown. While it is good, it only stands out because it has to, not because it is the best. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry, but think there are a lot of better ones to be had. It is good, and in some instances just being good is good enough. martinogradys.com/mulligans.html830 Oregon Center DriveOregon, WI 53575     (608) 835-6422",3475,0.19607820976491858,0.477335744424352

We have A couple years ago we took the short trip to Oregon during the lunch hour and had the Fish Fry at Mulligans Bar & Grill. While everything was acceptable, the lack of bread and the so-so fish made us wish we could do it over during dinner when the fish becomes AYCE and the bread flows like water. Well, as luck would have it we would get to take our mulligan at Mulligans, and much sooner than we ever expected. Gabe, Brice and I arrived at the Oregon hot spot and literally had to park in the road  the parking lot overflowing into the countryside beyond. We made haste to the hostess station and were given the 30 minute routine - fair enough. We settled into the bar, hoping for a quick 30, but lamenting what would likely be more like 60. Four hand-muddled Old Fashioneds, four Spotted Cows, five double Amareto Sours (the Friday special for some reason), and 90 minutes later, the once crowded bar was nearly empty and our group summoned. To the dining room we scurried, hungry as dogs and feeling no pain after our bevy of beverages.While it took a while to get our foot in the door, once in the service turned up a notch (or ten). The waitress was on us like that, took our orders, and was off. She returned in no time with our starters, of which we were allowed to choose clam chowder, coleslaw, or cottage cheese. According to Gabe the cottage cheese was standard Deans and while fine, not up to his Westby Co-op Creamery standards. A creamy slaw graced Brices plate and looked decent, but warranted no comments from the man himself. The clam chowder was creamy and delicious, and appeared to be the pick of this runty litter. I felt semi-lucky and would likely make the same choice next time around. Whats more, the little slice of French bread on the side paired better with the chowder, than either of the non-soup options. The fish appeared soon after and looked superb. While $13.50 is getting up there in price, the huge walleye fillet justified it. The pan-fried delight was almost an inch thick at the top and nearly hung off the both ends of the plate. The fish itself was flaky and light, with the classic walleye flavor. It was smooth and complemented by a crumbly breading which was fried to a crisp in parts and slightly under-fired in others. Even though the pan-frying made a fork necessary, the walleye was very good and had at least one of the cod eaters eating their heart out. The cod in this case was just fine, but nothing really exciting. It was your classic thick beer batter style with an inoffensive, but not enticing, flavor. All agreed it was acceptable, but not great - B cod, in our book.My side of choice was Mulligans waffle fries, and the spicy spuds were well-fried and plentiful, but as waffle fries tend to do, got cold quickly.  Still, I enjoyed them even then. I was also partial to the homemade tartar sauce which was super thick and had a potent relish kick that perked up both kinds of fish and put them over the top. Everyone deserves a second chance and Im glad we finally got around to giving Mulligans theirs. Everything this trip was a step up from our pervious visit (the long wait aside). Overall, we have no problem recommending the walleye special, and would even say the cod is worth a shot if you are in the AYCE kind of mood.

I was curious about the lunch situation, so I gave them a call to see what the deal was. I was pleased to learn that the lunch time fish n chips was the same fish, just in a smaller portion than the dinner Fish Fry. There is also no baked potato option, but that doesnt factor in with me one way or the other. I decided that the lunch option would have to suffice as MFFs visit to Mulligans, and headed out. On my way there I got a call from a friend, who said he was interested in some lunch. I swung through downtown, grabbed his lanky ass, and hit highway 14  heading south. About 5 minutes later we found ourselves in quaint Oregon, WI. We snaked our way through town, and eventually landed in the middle of the urban sprawl bullsh*t that is home to Mulligans. Not long ago this was a farmers field, but today, Fish Fry was all that was on our minds as we careened into their bustling parking lot. We grabbed some stools at the bar and waited for the bartender, who was a Vikings fan, to come over. Eventually she swung by, got us some Wisconsin beers, and took our fish orders. Jer also put in for the clam chowder which he devoured in no time flat and claimed was very good. The $7.50 fish n chips was ready shortly after and served to us by the cook.The two pieces of beer battered cod were decent, but nothing special. While the batter looked very thick it was actually pretty light, although it got greasy quickly. I am usually sure to rotate my fish periodically throughout my meal, as to avoid grease settling. Jer didnt have the same forethought, and by the time he got to the end of piece #2 it was a soggy mess. While the batter was hit and miss the actual fish was pretty flaky even with the grease that had accumulated thanks its coating. By and large it was fine.The Julienne style fries could also have been better. They must have finished frying before the fish because they were lukewarm when served and cold by the end. The tartar on the other hand may have saved the meal, it was simply great. It was zesty and thick with a ton of relish. My solo cup came filled to the brim, but was wiped clean by the end, and with only two pieces of fish mind you.The slaw served with lunch was plentiful, but very bland. It was highly reminiscent of Wilsons slaw which is fine, but does not have any zing to it. It wasnt great and certainly does not make up for the complete lack of bread. Unfortunately for Mulligans their fish n chips does not constitute a real Fish Fry, and cant quite be recommended. That being said, the Friday night Fish Fry could be a different animal. A cheap roll and a more substantial portion of fish could easily push it into the recommendable strata. Sometimes the difference between a recommendable Fish Fry and a one that isnt boils down to the presence of bread. Unfortunately for the lunch-time fish n chips at Mulligans, this is exactly the case. martinogradys.com/mulligans.html830 Oregon Center DriveOregon, WI 53575     (608) 835-6422",3399,0.11530591630591633,0.5397886002886003

It is always a gamble to mess with a classic; sometimes it works out, other times it doesn’t. The “Friday Night Fish Fry” at Dobahn definitely falls into the latter category. I have seen a variety of things at the Fish Fry over the years and several different renditions of the Wisconsin delight. Never have I seen something to rival this take on the tradition. Based on the fact that Dobhan is a Tibetan/Nepalese restaurant I would never have guessed they even offered Fish Fry on Friday nights, but I read somewhere this was the case and that it was actually quite good. I was intrigued by the prospects. I called Dobhan to verify that they indeed did have a Fish Fry and was reaffirmed that they did and this Friday the fish of choice was Walleye.The Atwood neighborhood was alive on this foggy Friday night due to the BoDeans concert taking place at the Barrymore. We had to park a couple blocks down the street and arrived at Dobhan about 7:30. The street was hoppin’ but the restaurant was relatively quiet and we were able to get seated pretty much immediately. Our perky, dreadlocked waitress was at the table within minutes. She went over their specials and mentioned the Fish Fry but said it was Cod rather than Walleye. I was slightly confused but ordered it nonetheless.As a precursor to the entrée there is a soup/salad option. The salad was good with a delicious honey-poppy seed dressing, but the soup was even better. It was some kind of traditional Nepali soup and had a perfect blend of spices. We also ordered a plate of flat bread which was served with 3 spreads (hummus) and was phenomenal. This was possibly the best bread I have ever eaten, I sh*t you not. Unfortunately since it was not included with the actual Fish Fry it doesn’t count as part of the bread score.After having great bread and salad the actual Fish Fry was a bit of a let down. The Walleye (yes it was Walleye, not Cod) was basically one tiny filet with a strange crumbly batter. It was definitely pan-fried and not deep fried which made it slightly mushy and very atypical of a Fish Fry. It tasted okay but was puny and just not up to snuff. The French fries that accompanied it were delicious but also served in the smallest quantity imaginable. The “tartar sauce” tasted good but was not even actual tartar. It was more of a vinegar and oil dressing with cilantro and some onion in it. It was very strange and barely counts. Needless to say with the small potions I was still hungry when we left and for $14 that should not be the case. The atmosphere at Dobahn is great. The Asian theme is well incorporated and since it is a new restaurant it is still very clean and nice. The service was also good and the food is very high quality. Unfortunately there is just no way I can recommend this Fish Fry. It is a nice effort to incorporate a Wisconsin classic into a menu where it doesn’t seem to belong. The way they did the Fish Fry just didn’t work. I will certainly be back at a later date to try some of their other Nepalese dishes though. The things we did have off the everyday menu were very good and I think I would be able highly recommend Dobhan, just not for a Friday Night Fish Fry.The worst part about having an offbeat, subpar Fish Fry at Dobahn was having to walk past Wilson's afterward on the way back to the car.

If I am lucky enough to have Fish Fry for lunch it is almost always Cod. If this is the case I try to change it up for dinner and have some Lake Perch, Bluegill or another freshwater fish for dinner. The day started with a trip to the Silver Eagle, which was actually pretty darn good, and I figured it would be a freshwater Fish Fry for dinner since I had Cod. It is a good thing I am flexible and willing to buck these trends or I would still have yet to try the Fish Fry at the Del-Bar in Lake Delton and I would not know what I was missing out on. I found out some of my friends were going to the Dells for the weekend and didn’t have a lot of plans. I figured since it is less than an hour away we could meet them for a Fish Fry and have a couple drinks. I heard somewhere that the Del-Bar was a nice place and had a Fish Fry special that was very good, so we made the drive. We arrived at the Bar around 8:15 and met our friends. For those of you who have not been to the Del-Bar the name “bar” may be slightly misleading. This place is ridiculously nice, especially when you take into account your average Wisconsin restaurant. It may have once been a humble small town bar/supper club but in its current state it rivals a very nice Chicago steakhouse or the nicest restaurants in downtown Madison. I was very impressed with the atmosphere, this is a classy joint. We had a round of drinks, gave our name to the waitress and were seated at an awesome booth/table within about 5 minutes. The Fish Fry at the Del-Bar is about the cheapest thing on the menu clocking in at $13. Every other entre is in the $20-$35 range so you know this is a swanky place. The fish is Cod (if you couldn’t tell from the intro) and was delicious. It was served in four chunks (Avenue Bar style) and fried perfectly. The batter was superb. It held together exceptionally well while not being firm or chewy. The fish was flaky and tender and absolutely melt-in-your-mouth kind of stuff. The French fries which accompanied the fish were also great. They were shoestring style and while not served scalding hot tasted delicious until the end. The tartar sauce was also amazing. I could not quite put my finger on it but there was something extra special about it, a special ingredient of sorts. Fish, good. Tartar, good. Fish AND tartar at the same time, phenomenal.The bread selection at the Del-Bar was also great. Right when you sit down there is a basket of thin garlic bread and other assorted cracker style items then once the Fish Fry comes you are treated to another round of soft dinner rolls. I think there was also some coleslaw somewhere but I don’t really remember it at all but I’m sure it was good.Be warned: the Fish Fry comes with a soup/salad option. I asked if it was possible to upgrade to Caeser since I like it better than a regular tossed salad, she said no problem. I didn’t realize there was a $3 up charge, but that is not the issue. The problem was in upgrading to Caesar I inadvertently got a full potion that covered an entire dinner plate. This thing was gigantic. It was all I could do to enjoy as much of it as possible and still save room for my Fish Fry. I felt bad leaving some of it on the plate but there was just no way. Take heed, if you are upgrading to a Caesar you might want someone to share it with.The Del-Bar is a fancy yet casual restaurant. In a place like this you can usually expect great service and our waitress was every bit of excellent. She knew the menu forwards and backwards and did an amazing job of keeping everyone at the table happy and full. A true professional. Overall this was a spectacular Fish Fry. Everything about it was top notch. The fish, the fries, the tartar, and the rolls were all amazing. Top it off with great service and a fantastic establishment and the Del-Bar is winner. I will be back many times I can assure you. It is obviously off-peak season in the Dells which made getting a table easy, if you plan on going in the Summer I would highly recommend a reservation as this place must get packed with all the tourists. This is a classic Fish Fry; I am having trouble not drooling as I sit here and think back on deliciousness that is the Del-Bar.www.del-bar.com/800 Wisconsin Dells ParkwayLake Delton, WI 53940     1-866-888-1861",4345,0.2877173091458807,0.6014845339845338

This sense of discovery empowers us to think of these items as better than they really are and gives us hope for more unexpected discoveries in the fututre. A couple months ago we stumbled across Deli Delicious on Madisons North Side, and were incredibly impressed by the quality of the Fish Fry. Everything was simply excellent and I knew we would be back time and again since it is pretty close to our house and we can get in and out quickly if necessary. It just so happened that we needed our Fish Fry to be speedy this Friday, so I called the Deli and placed my order.The lady on the phone told me it would only be about ten minutes until my 4-piece would be ready so I bolted out the door. I arrived at the County M mainstay about 5 minutes later and she was already boxing it up. I was out the door of DD and in my front door in less than 15 minutes from the time my call was placed. How is that for turn-around time? I wasted no time tearing open the bag and diving into the container which housed my fried bounty.The cod was perched atop a couple pieces of parchment/wax paper. Like my previous encounter the four long fillets had a light batter which clung to the fish well. The cod was light and flaky, but did not fall apart when handled. Overall, it was very good, but unlike my last trip the batter seemed a little less spicy. The blend of seasonings seemed to have been toned down, and wasnt bad by any means, but just not quite as memorable as the first visit. Regardless, I finished all I planned on eating, and was able to save my last piece for fish sandwich the next day.Even though my trip between DD and home was very short, the fat crinkle cut fries were noticeable the whole way, as they filled my car with their brilliant aroma. They were slathered in season salt and tasted just great, although they could have been left in the fryer for another minute or two to crisp them up a bit. Even so, they complimented the cod very well and also tasted great with the tartar sauce. The gigantic cup of mayo-laden tartar had no problem outlasting the generous portion of cod and fries. Like the fish, it was delicious, but could have used a little something (more relish in this case) to spice it up a notch. The creamy slaw that accompanied the Fish Fry was also pretty good, but the baked beans were very average and actually tasted a little burned. Oh well, side items cant ruin a Fish Fry in our book.A grandma-esque dinner roll also came along for the journey, but unlike grandmas was not served hot. This lukewarm bun was certainly average, but little more. Overall, this is an easy Fish Fry to recommend, but after my second visit some of the luster has certainly faded. While everything is tasty, this meal is not quite on par with the best out there. However, with such a quick turnaround I will still have no problem getting carryout from time to time. For goodness sakes, I ordered at 7:08 and was writing this review by 7:38. It certainly cant get any faster than that can it?

Thanks to this exceptionally keen sense of smell they are the worlds preeminent sniffers and have the ability to pick up even the slightest of scents and track them for miles. Like a bloodhound, I have a strong nose. My nose is a little different however. It is not so much a physical gift like that of the bloodhound, it is more of a sixth sense, a calling. Every Friday I feel the pull. It is an invocation telling me there are delicious, undiscovered Fish Frys to be eaten. I am powerless to resist it and follow my nose into uncharted waters.I have known about Deli Delicious for some time now, but recently heard some good things about their Fish Fry while poking around here and there. Since I had good reason to stay close to home (Wisconsin vs. Minnesota-Duluth hockey on TV) I decided that this was the ideal opportunity to finally give their takeout Fish Fry a shot. I gave them a call and put in an order for three, 3-piece dinners with French fries. She gave me an estimate of 10 minutes and I was on my way.Now, normally takeout is not an option for me since I like my fish fresh from the fryer, and by the time takeout gets home it usually less than hot. However, Deli Delicious is not very far from where I live so I figured it just might work. I arrived at the Westport establishment about five minutes after I placed my order and noticed that they do have a couple tables in the tiny space. While this makes takeout optional I wouldnt say the ambiance is really worth sticking around for, however, if you were in a pinch these tables would get you by. I paid the pleasant lady behind the counter and after a couple minutes the fish exited the fryer and I was out the door. I sped home with the enchanting aroma of fresh Fish Fry filling my car. I whipped into the garage, tore open the front door and ripped into the plastic bag which housed my bounty. As I popped open my Styrofoam container a great plume of steam rose to the ceiling and welcomed me to my first at home Fish Fry. I flipped the lid on the humongous cup of tartar and grabbed one of my three (and a half) cod loins. At first bite it was clear, this is great stuff. The long cod fillets were meaty and exceptionally tasty. They were adorned with a fantastic, spicy batter with just the perfect amount of taste. The fish itself was light and flaky with no grease to be found, simply outstanding. It fell apart effortlessly into tender white sheets of pure deliciousness. Gabe proclaimed it to be superior to the cod he enjoyed earlier that day at Dexters even though by the time he got home to eat it was at least 30 minutes past its prime. That is really saying something.The decadent fish was complimented by an equally delicious tartar. It was incredibly thick with a high percentage of mayo. The cup was so large that no one person should dare consume its contents at one sitting for risk of tartar overload. Coming in just below the fish and tartar were the thick cut crinkle fries. They were coated in a nice seasoning but were kind of a mixed bag with some being a little soggy while others were just perfect. In general they were still pretty tasty and certainly above average.Whether you opt for the 2-piece for $6.75, the 3-piece for $8.25 or the 4-piece for $9.75 you get coleslaw and baked beans on the side. The sides were crammed into their separate compartments and covered with a sheet of wax paper to keep them off the fish and fries. The slaw was finely chopped with a runny, yet creamy texture. It looked unappealing in its confined space, but its taste more than made of for its lackluster appearance. The baked beans were also a little sloppy looking, but played their part admirably. The standard potato roll was a fine addition and I will give them a little bonus for warming it up. It took some time and I strayed from the path on numerous instances, but the stars finally aligned brought me to Deli Delicious. If not for the tasty walleye I had for lunch at Dexters, and the Badger hockey game being shown exclusively on Charter Extra it may never have happened. Overall, this is a great Fish Fry and I highly recommend it. If you live in Waunakee or on Madisons North Side you owe it to yourself to try the Fish Fry at Deli Delicious. I will certainly be back; in fact I am going to have a problem making myself go to other places when Deli Delicious has such a great Fish Fry so close.

Since then Ive had a couple really great rounds of Fish Fry, and a couple that turned out to be not so great. When the first Friday in December rolled around I really wasnt in the mood for taking chances. I thought this would be as good of a time as any for Gabe to try the Park Side since their cod was great and he is a bit of a cod fanatic. Unfortunately, his wisdom tooth had other ideas which rendered him unable to eat, so I made the journey to McFarland solo yet again. The last time I visited the PSP it was pretty much just me and a bunch of regulars; and by regulars, I mean regulars. It was your common clan of Sconnie gents, just hanging out and havin a beer or two to start the weekend off right. This time was no different and Im pretty sure it was the same 10 or so dudes. The bar was full of em so I grabbed a table for myself and awaited the arrival of the bartender/waitress. She stopped by quickly, took my order for a 3-piece and a Spotted Sow, and sped away towards the kitchen. She was back about two minutes later with my beer, some coleslaw and a roll. I dove right into the slaw and found it was kind of runny and very raw tasting this time. I actually remembered it being much creamier and zestier my previous visit. The roll seemed to be pretty much identical on both visits and was perfectly average. I finished the roll and poked around at the slaw for a about 5 minutes before my fish was ready and served to me fresh from the fryer. The fry cook that brought my fish this time was a different lady from my previous visit and the fish reflected it. While it was still good, it was different and not quite as tasty or well fried. The batter this time seemed to be more thrown together and while it was still light and flaky it lacked flavor and the fall-apart texture I was expecting. It also seemed as though the fish was slightly overcooked which made some of the thinner portions tough. Dont get me wrong, it was still good, just not as great as the first time. Like my prior visit I again chose the beer battered fries over the plain and was glad I did. They were perfectly fried, had great flavor and were more than plentiful. The tartar on the other hand was in short supply. It was a tasty little combo but with such a small portion I ran short before my fish supply had been exhausted. Since the bartender never came by to ask how I was doing, I never got more but managed to span it out as best I could. While not as good as a fully loaded tartar bite, the last couple were just fine without it.As I finished my plate of food, save for a bit of the coleslaw mountain, the bartender came over and grabbed it. I downed the last of my beer and headed to the bar with a ten dollar bill in hand, seven bucks for the fish and three for the beer. I dropped a couple dollar tip, and left the bar no longer than 20 minutes after I went in. It was almost like stealing.Overall, this is a great little Fish Fry; it reminds me of Wilsons  a lot, and I can easily recommend it. For only $7.00 you get the total package - fish, fries and tartar which are right on the money, as well as some slaw and a roll that play their part adequately. Apparently, the 10 regulars and I are the only ones who have figured this out which is just fine with me because it allows me to get a great Fish Fry at a great price in no time flat.

When people talk about their favorite Fish Fry it is common to hear of the usual suspects like the Avenue Bar or the Old Fashioned and once in a while somewhere off the beaten path like Norms Hideaway down near Edgerton. One place on the Fish Finder that I had never really heard any rumblings about is the Park Side Pub in McFarland. I knew they had a Fish Fry, but beyond that fact had not heard anything good (or bad) about it. Since I was a one man wrecking crew this Friday, and I knew they had a lunch special I headed down highway 51 towards Lake Waubesa and the PSP.I showed up before noon and grabbed a stool just down the bar from a group of regulars who were enjoying some beers this lovely Friday morning. The signs on the wall and in the entryway highlighted the cod special  2-piece for $6 and 3-piece for $7, along with the other options, some Fish Fry related, some not. The bartender/waitress could tell I was here to eat and came over quickly to take my drink and food orders. Since I was hungry but not starving I went for the 2-piece cod with beer fries and opted for coleslaw instead of cottage cheese.As I sat back and sipped my cool, clean Cow I was almost forced into watching a stupid infomercial for some sort of spine-fixing chair on the jumbo TV. Luckily for me the other direction featured the kitchen and I was able to peak back there from time to time and see exactly what their Fish Fry entailed. As I watched the cook hand batter the fish and release them to the fryer the waitress brought me a roll and my side of slaw. The slaw was creamy and good even though it featured lots of poppy seeds. The roll was very plain-Jane but just fine and really exactly what I expect at a Fish Fry. I polished both of them off and waited for the entrée which came about 10 minutes later.The cod was simply great. The homemade batter was incredibly light and flaky and had a superb flavor. It was so light it pretty much fell off the fish in certain spots which made it difficult to handle but no less delicious. The fish itself was also light and flaky with nary a hint of grease. I was blown away. The beer fries were also outstanding. They were crispy and flavorful and looked much better than plain crinkle fry option.The tartar was served in a tiny little cup but like the fish and fries was absolutely great. It was super thick and heavy on the mayo, just how I like it. However if I had opted for the 3-piece another cup would certainly have been necessary. The 2-piece turned out to be no match for me as I destroyed practically every morsel of food on the plate besides the lemon wedge. 3-piece for sure next time. The icing on the cake was the service which was fast and fairly friendly, although you can tell the bartender has been at this a while and doesnt take any sh*t from anyone. However, since the PSP is in McFarland smoking is still kosher so you have to deal with that, but it doesnt really bother me.Overall, this is certainly a phenomenal value but whats more it is simply a great Fish Fry. For six bucks you really cant ask for anything more. The fish, fries and tartar were great and the roll and slaw did their job. I was truly amazed at how good this Fish Fry was and predict a return trip to the Park Side Pub in the near future. 5016 Erling AvenueMcFarland, WI 53558     (608) 838-6045",3436,0.21189625850340135,0.5235487528344673

Wait, what's that? The ""Viroqua"" area you say? Never heard of it. Google it...then take a drive.V-town is our hometown and when we head up that way we invariably end up at the Hollow. In truth, we know the guy who owns the place, his main bartender served at our wedding, and our folks go down there at least once a week whether it's for fish or not. Most things (including the fish) at NoHo are cheap, but in a good way. They aren't looking to rake their customers over the coals and you can get and 3-piece cod for $8 or walleye for $12. It's also SW WI so anything and everything is going to come beer battered and that's the way people like it. Of course, you can get your cod broiled, but where's the fun in that? I ate cod earlier in the day up in LaX so I figured the walleye made the most sense. As you'd expect the walleye was one big piece and buried under a bountiful batter. There wasn't a lot of flavor, but plenty of batter to peel and discard. The meat itself was good, and there was surprisingly little grease trapped by the creamy coating. While I can't say for certain that it was walleye (because the batter was so substantial), at that price point I really have to wonder. Regardless, it was tasty despite the fact it didn't have the signature walleye flavor. The crispy battered fries on the side were fried to perfection and NoHo definitely doesn't skimp on the portion. The fish and fries all kind of blend together into an amalgamation of frydom, which isn't bad but does make it hard to appreciate one without the other. A nice thick tartar came straight out of the supper club (or Reinhart truck) and did all it could to tame the beefy beer batter. A good old SW WI dinner roll followed suit as did the enchanting slaw. My mom claims she knows the ladies who make all the salads (potato salad, macaroni salad, and coleslaw) and they are ""masters"". I'll take her word for it as this stuff definitely hits the sweet spot. Those same ladies also did some of the catering at our wedding. Norwegian Hollow is the quintessential country bar, and has the quintessential southwestern Wisconsin Fish Fry. Sure, it's not the best we've had, but it's also far from the worst. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and think it checks all the Fish Fry boxes...the Hollow itself checks all the rest.

Norwegian Hollow has cod and walleye in Fridays and since its a small town theyre both really cheaplike $9.50 for a 5-piece cod or $11.50 for walleye cheap. It almost feels like stealing. Both fish come with the same beer batter which works well on the cod, but causes the walleye to lose a little something. The pieces of cod are adequately sized but not hulking by any means. Their light and flaky texture pairs well with the light beer batter striking a delicate balance. The walleye is a little more peculiar as the fillet is on the small side and all of the inherent flavor is lost under the golden colored coating. While there is nothing wrong with it, it doesnt have anything that draws one in either. A boatload of freezer fries bounce along and do their job with a nice batter that crisps them up considerably and makes them a little something more. The tartar is basic (likely just the Reinhart stuff)you know what it is. Some Reinhart-y slaw was equally basic, but there is a ton of it to go around.

A couple buddies of mine mentioned that The Norwegian Hollow Hideaway was quietly offering a superb Fish Fry and I needed to check it out. I called my folks to see if they were interested in dinner and we headed out. The Hollow is definitely a bar that serves food and not vice versa. The bar itself was packed but the 5-6 tables around it were sparsely occupied. We took one of the open tables and grabbed some drinks. The Fish Fry specials were typed on yellow half sheets of paper and waiting on the table top. It read: #1 –“Wild Caught” Canadian Lake Perch: $9.25 and #2 “Wild Caught” Canadian Bluegill: $8.25, each with your choice of two sides. Both options sounded delicious but I settled on the Bluegill and my parents both got the Lake Perch. Of the 5 side options I chose the French fries and potato salad over macaroni salad, coleslaw and cottage cheese. Mom and Dad both got the macaroni salad and settled on French fries. They had to settle for the fries because the coleslaw was sold out by 7pm. They were both kind of let down and I have to agree, running out of coleslaw by 7pm on Friday night is kind of crazy. We put it behind us and moved on.The fish came about 15 minutes or so after we ordered and was served in true bar form on Chinet paper plates. The Bluegill was as tasty as I had hoped and more than plentiful. It was lightly battered and perfectly fried. The tartar sauce was also superb. It was in a big squeeze bottle but came right from the fridge and really put the Bluegill over the top. A great combo. The French fries were also very good but about as scarce as I have seen. You should never really be able to spread your fries out and count them, but I could; and there were less than ten fries total which was kind of a bummer. The Lake Perch was also very good, although I liked the Bluegill slightly better. They were battered similarly; I just think the Bluegill had a little more flavor. The bread served with the Fish Fry was a straight up piece of pre-sliced white bread with butter. It was very average but very acceptable. The potato salad was very good as was the macaroni salad according to my parents.  If you are ever in southwest Wisconsin on a Friday night and looking for some local culture and a delicious Fish Fry take the drive down to Norwegian Hollow. The bar itself is updated and probably one of the nicer bars in the area. Overall this a great Fish Fry. It is simple and low-key, just what a Fish Fry should be.

You just say yes and count your blessings. Youre going to the Owls Nest! Youre one lucky fella. The Owls Nest is one of, if not the best Fish Fry in the area (and probably the world for that matter). While the place is guaranteed to be busy on Friday night the bar is plenty hospitable and any wait you have to endure will assuredly fly by. Once inside the dining room things run like clockwork and a friendly server will be at your side in short order. While perch is on the menu, the main Friday special is cod which comes beer battered or breaded for $12 or broiled for a buck more. Ive never been able to bring myself to order the perch (or the broiled for that matter) since the cod is amazing, but I bet theyre pretty good too. Before the fish, big bowls of baked beans and coleslaw show up along with three slices of dark rye. Thats right, three full slices of bread for a single order of fish! Now thats impressive! The slaw is house-made and as creamy as they come. It has plenty of pop, which enhances the surprisingly mellow rye quite nicely. The beans are very welcome addition, and well done (although to be fair there are better baked beans out there  the legumes atPatricks Grill near McFarland come to mind).Once youve gotten your fill of these appetizers (or maybe even before that) the fish will show up and it will be hot, Hot, HOT!!! The Owls Nests special beer batter is miraculous and as good as they come. Its light and flavorful and pairs perfectly with the flaky cuts of cod. Five generous pieces totaling 14 ounces grace the plate and make for a grand portion that should suit the heartiest of appetites. Of course, if you just cant get enough you can always add extras at a buck a pop. Now thats flexibility! Lots of thick-cut fries join the party and have a little season salt to give them a kick. The soft spuds are much better than plain crinkles, but not quite the house-cut quality some other places offer. If you look up tartar sauce in the dictionary there may well be a picture of the Owls Nests homemade mix (or at least there should be). This stuff is as thick as glue and just as clingy with a superb pop and ideal consistency. Kapow! Kazzam! Kerplop? Now thats zesty!Fish, fries, tartar, coleslaw, rye, AND baked beans. If all that wasnt enough to get you excited for the Old Fashioned Dining the Owls Nest has to offer maybe this will  they are one of the few establishments around that still offers a full-fledged salad bar and you can tack it on to the Fish Fry for only $2. Now thats traditional!The Owls Nest doesnt mess around when it comes to the Friday Fish Fry and it shows. You get so much food for $12 that even though its not AYCE its probably still more than you should eat. Of course, if you want or need more, you can always add a piece or two or take a spin through the salad bar. It really is incredible and everything a Fish Fry can and should be. Overall, we highly, Highly, HIGHLY recommend this Fish Fry and cant wait to take our next drive up Highway 51.

If you're from Wisconsin, you know it's pronounced shmelt, not smelt. Once upon a time, smelt fries were found almost everywhere this time of year, from the VFW to the Eagles to the supper clubs, and they brought people out en masse. Those who've never ventured into smelt-filled waters should know that the fish are small and have a stronger-than-average fishy flavor (not unlike a sardine). They're usually served with the head, tail and guts removed, but since they are so small, and their bones so fine, they're usually not filleted. The firm-textured meat holds together well, allowing them to be eaten like a french fry, even after they've exited the deep fryer.In recent years the popularity of smelt has waned. That could be in part because the catches have been smaller since the mid-1980s, according to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. Luckily there are still a few great ones out there, if you know where to look. The area's smelt fry of record is currently at the North Bristol Sportsman's Club, northeast of Sun Prairie. It recalls the heyday of smelt. First and foremost, it's all you can eat (or at least, all you can fit on your plate on two trips through the buffet line). The smelt are lightly breaded and delicious, and there are a ton of amazing sides to choose from. The cheesy potatoes, scooped right out of a giant foil tray, are brilliant -- rich and gooey with a cornflake topping that evokes memories of high school athletic banquets. The potato pancakes are perfect, and the coleslaw is creamy. On the table sits a bottle of tartar sauce and one of shrimp sauce for those looking for a change of pace. Bread and coffee are also available, and some crispy fried chicken is on hand for those wary of smelt. However, there's only one smelt fry left at the North Bristol Sportsman's Club this season -- Saturday, April 12. Doors open at 4 p.m.; serving starts at 5 p.m. Get out there if you want to sample the best the area has to offer. While smelt season is winding down in North Bristol, it's just kicking off at the Owl's Nest in Poynette. Here, the smelt is all-you-can-eat but comes with limited coleslaw, baked beans, french fries and rye bread. The slaw, beans, bread and tartar will hit the table first. Be sure to establish a base for the smelt that is to come. And come it will. The Owl's Nest holds nothing back when it comes to smelt, and the plates come stacked high with golden fried goodness. As in Bristol, the smelt are lightly breaded in a well-seasoned mixture that takes some of the edge off the fish without stealing their thunder. It's not unusual to put away 20 to 30 of the tiny divers, especially when they're interspersed with some of the supper club's french fries. The smelt menu is served Sundays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays through April 17. Dexter's Pub has established itself as one of Madison's preeminent fish fry joints. It recently kicked off a Wednesday night smelt fry. While it's not all-you-can-eat (diners get around 12 fish), it's still a good deal. Dexter's puts in some serious prep work. Not only are the heads and tails chopped off and the guts cleaned out, but the kitchen goes the extra mile to fillet each and every one of them. From there, the fish are coated in Dexter's signature light breading and fried to golden-brown perfection. The filleting causes the smelt to lie totally flat, which for some reason also causes them to be totally delicious. Dexter's also does due diligence with the sides and offers a slice of rye to top things off. While most places serve smelt only for a certain period in the spring, there are still a few restaurants that offer it every day, year-round. The Beach House in McFarland is one. The smelt there are lightly dusted with a superb seasoned breading. These are some of the best smelt you'll find in the area, and they come with the standard sides. It's a great option for those who don't want to (or simply can't) wait for the spring smelt season. www.owlsnestzuege.com/index.html617 E North StreetPoynette, WI 53955     (608) 635-2298",4126,0.1765668934240363,0.5225941043083899

Cod has become the most common fish eaten at Fish Frys mostly due to the light texture and inoffensive taste. The mild fish is basically a canvass on which a batter masterpiece is meant to be painted, and in Wisconsin we have some of the best artists around. The Van Gogh of the genre resides in the small town of Poynette  about 45 minutes north of downtown Madison. These masterpieces fried here are available for a mere $11, and while it isnt an All You Can Eat Fish Fry, the 5-piece is perfectly portioned. When most people think of batter fried fish they think of a thick, gooey, greasy mess  this is far from the case at the Owls Nest. This beer batter is special; it is light, grease-free, and tastes simply marvelous. It complements the pristine cod perfectly without taking all the focus off the flaky fish. It is flat-out the best beer battered cod around, and even though the Owls Nest features a lightly breaded version of the cod, we cant bring ourselves to try it again. While both styles are great, if you can only choose one, wed go with the booze infused coating  there is just something special about it. With your fish youll receive a hefty portion of thick-cut Julienne fries, some rye bread, and cups of house-made tartar sauce, coleslaw, and baked beans. Everything, save for the fries, will come before the fish, giving you some time to dive into the goodness. The slaw will be good, falling in the creamy end of the spectrum with a nice zippy finish; the baked beans will be a nice addition the meal (they dont come standard with most Fish Frys), but wont blow your socks off; and the rye bread will be superb. While many are not fans of rye, it is the traditional bread served with Fish Frys and thus we appreciate it. The dark rye served at the Owls Nest pairs nicely with the coleslaw, adding a nuance to the meal that is hard to find elsewhere. While it may seem like a long way to go for some beer battered cod, the trip to Poynette is worth every drop of gas. The fish is simply superb, and serves as a shining example of what every Fish Fry should be. Inside Tip: Ice Cream DrinksA bellyful of fish is made all the better by a delicious homemade Grasshopper, Pink Squirrel, or Brandy Alexander  specialties at most supper clubs, but especially at the Owls Nest. Whats more, you know the place is a classic supper club when they give you a 50 cent piece as change.*If you MUST stay in Madison and still want beer battered cod there are a lot of options, but they all pale in comparison to the Owls Nest. The best local option is Quiveys Grove on Madisons south side. For some reason The Avenue Bar often tops the annual Best of Madison lists, but in our opinion they are mostly getting by on reputation, and while their beer battered cod is fine, it has slipped in quality over the past few years. Quiveys Grove has usurped their thrown and is still All You Can Eat and still delicious, just not Owls Nest delicious.

When we started this compendium of fishly knowledge we never intended to make our unbiased opinions know to the public, and it was only at the behest of the other (better) half of MFF that we decided to go public. Gabe was the one who saw the light, and realized that we were actually creating a semi-valuable resource just by doing what we loved to do. Well, after many good Fish Frys with my good friend he has turned a new page in his life, this time trying his hand as partner at an Internet start-up in Silicon Valley. Since he was leaving for an extended period of time, I knew we needed to send him off the right way - with a Fish Fry for the ages.  Luckily for us, with Christmas Eve falling on a Friday, the Owls Nest decided to offer their otherworldly delight the preceding Thursday. We seized the opportunity, and arrived at the classic supper club just before 7pm, during what would be normally be the busiest portion of a Friday evening. Christmas Eve-Eve turned out to be a blessing, and as soon as our group of four wheeled around the bar we were led directly to one of the available tables in wood panel laden the dining room. The speedy waitress came over instantly, and took our drink orders. When she came back with our Cows we filled out the parley card with beer-battered cod for the fish eaters, and fettuccini alfredo for our vegetarian. Prior to receiving the entrees three bowls and one basket graced our presence. The first bowl was loaded down with a massive scoop of tartar sauce, the second with coleslaw, and the third with baked beans. We pounced on the slaw and beans almost immediately, and took generous portions of each. The slaw was clearly homemade, and while it wasnt really creamy, it tasted very good. Whereas the beans were a nice addition to the Fish Fry staples, but just so-so. The basket that joined in the fun was stockpiled with above-average white rolls, and marvelous marble rye slices. The melding of spoonfuls of slaw, and bites of buttered rye set the stage perfectly for the sweetness that was to come. When the steaming hot cod emerged from the kitchen a short time later Gabe and I wasted no time snatching a few pieces from our shared platter and going to work. I began with three pieces on my plate, and before I knew what was what, a lone soldier remained. This fish was so light and flaky it seemingly vanished into thin air. Truth be told, the batter was simply superb, and combined with the fish so well that it was impossible to resist, and I basically inhaled it. When all was said and done, not one of the 10 - 11 golden fried goodies that graced our table remained.The heavenly cod was good enough to stand on its own, but when combined with the practically perfect tartar, it jumped to another level. The superb sauce was incredibly thick and zesty with an ideal amount of relish. The once proud bowlful that gleefully taunted us through the coleslaw and beans was a shadow of its former self by meals end.Alongside the fish rode a pale stranger in the form of thick Julienne cut French fries. These were the kind of fries you come to expect at traditional supper clubs, and while they were fine, they wont blow your socks off. That said, for this style of French fry, they were above average, and did what was necessary while allowing the fish to lead the charge. At the Owls Nest rodeo the fish is the head buckaroo, as it should be at any good Fish Fry.  When people hear the term Fish Fry they expect beer battered cod to be the featured fish. We love king cod, but historically have not been huge fans of beer batter, and our rankings have reflected that fact. This was a bit of a shortcoming on our part since the desire of true Wisconsinites was somewhat sublimated by our own personal preferences. Well, thankfully someone has finally stepped to the plate with a beer batter we feel confident calling the best. Overall, we highly recommend the Fish Fry at the Owls Nest, and feel fully confident situating them atop the heap. If you are a Fish Fry fanatic like we are, this is one youve simply gotta get under your belt. When all was said and done, we paid our bill, generously tipped our scrupulous waitress, and were rewarded for our patronage with an owl shaped Christmas tree ornament. All in all, it turned out to be a fantastic experience at the Owls Nest, and a very fitting way to send Gabe off on his big adventure to the West Coast. Well miss our comrade, but know full well hell be back, and when he does return we can guarantee hell have a hankering for some of the best beer battered cod around. Luckily for him we have a pretty good idea where we can find it www.owlsnestzuege.com/index.html617 E North StreetPoynette, WI 53955     (608) 635-2298",4809,0.25863133745156214,0.522411514827245

I browse the web, talk to local folks and take note when I drive past establishments that look like they might have the inside track to killer Fish Fry. I was back in my hometown a few weeks ago and stumbled across an old friend from high school who currently lives in Poynette. I of course ask her where everyone goes on Fridays assuming she will say Hooker’s Resort since that is what I have heard mentioned on the ol’ inter-webs. She wastes no time in saying “The Owl’s Nest” which surprised me a little; I had never heard of it nor heard it mentioned anywhere online so I figured she must be nuts. She was very confident in her assessment and claimed to have firsthand knowledge of it’s deliciousness. I was easily persuaded and moved them to the top of my list. We headed to Poynette not really knowing exactly where the restaurant was but having an idea that it was just off 51 on the north end of town. We drove through what I assume was downtown Poynette and eventually came upon the Owl’s Nest with its bright red neon sign glowing like a beacon in the night.  The parking lot was enough to verify that this beacon had brought us to a Fish Fry hotspot, it was packed. We got inside, got our name on the list, got a couple stools at the bar and a couple drinks in our hands; we were ready.We only had to wait 15 minutes or so and our table was ready too. We headed into the dining area and put in our order almost immediately since we had time to look over our options during the wait. The Fish Fry special at the Owl’s Nest will run you $11 and is cod only but, you do get the option of beer batter or regular batter (obviously you can also get it baked but, c’mon). If you ever read MFF.com you know that I am not a huge fan of beer batter and when given the option almost always go regular. The Owl’s Nest is now the #1 exception to that rule.I am just going to come right out and say it, this is the best beer battered cod I have ever had. The batter was light and flaky but still had the traditional golden coloring of beer batter. The batter was much more subtle than most beer batters and let the taste of thee cod come through underneath. It wasn’t thick and crispy either, just perfect. The plain fried was not far below either. It had a thin, flaky texture which really let the taste of the fish come through. After trying both styles back to back it was clear the beer batter had something extra. My god it was good.The French fries were also excellent. They were fried just right and spiced up with Lawry’s season salt or something very similar. The tartar sauce was also just about perfect and the two of us had no problem draining the entire cup worth. Fish, Fries, Tarter…Game, set, match: Owl’s Nest.The coleslaw served was very average however, but the fact that you get baked beans in addition to it made up for any shortcomings. The dark rye slice was also a nice traditional touch which I gobbled up lickety-split.Overall, this is a phenomenal Fish Fry. I thought this was going to be much more of a bar atmosphere and when you walk in that is immediately what you are hit with. The dining room is much more Supper Club-y and certainly a family friendly place. The Fish Fry was simply outstanding and the service was just fine. I have no qualms about calling this one of the best Fish Fries in Madison; if you try it for yourself I think you will agree. Thanks for the great recommendation Brooke! We will call next time, and believe me, there will be a next time. www.owlsnestzuege.com/index.html617 E North StreetPoynette, WI 53955     (608) 635-2298",3655,0.19629026610644254,0.4690726675285499

Subtle upgrades like, the perfect tartar, the addition of homemade potato pancakes or, of course, the bump up to All You Can Eat are the intricate nuances that separate the best of the best from the pack. Some places have figured out these differences over the span of many years while others seem to stumble into perfection overnight. The Nite Cap Inn, in quaint Palmyra, falls into the former category. They have been playing the Fish Fry game for a while now, and definitely know what they are doing (in more ways than one).Now, I fully realize that Palmyra isn’t exactly Madison proper, but I had heard nothing except good things about The Nite Cap, and when some of our wedding guests stuck around the Milwaukee area for an extra week I knew what needed to be done. I proposed the Fish Fry hot spot as a rendezvous point, and as it turns out this group of good ol’ Wisconsin gals were primed for a meet up. We agreed to convene at 6:00, and when my lovely bride and I strode in the door on the hour we were pleasantly surprised to see their smiling faces waiting for us. We grabbed a drink at the bar, told the “hostess” that our whole group was here, and chatted for a spell. About 5 minutes later, said hostess came by and took our orders as we sat at the bar (true supper club style). She then scurried off to drop the orders by the kitchen leaving us to ruminate on the festivities of the prior weekend. We conversed for a bit as we sipped our drinks and did our best to look past the bartender’s near incessant inquiries on whether or not we were ready for more (The Nite Cap pushes the booze apparently, and has you order at the bar for a reason). About 15 minutes later we were ushered to the main dining room, through a set of doors, and into a smaller, more secluded back room. This room was setup with two long tables, perfect for larger groups (which we actually had). The tables were set with what looked like dishes from your grandma’s cupboard and family style bowls of coleslaw, apple sauce, and tartar. We all quickly dove into the homemade slaw and apple sauce and each put away a servings worth or so. The slaw, while being homemade, wasn’t great, but certainly wasn’t bad either. It was cool and creamy and set the stage for the AYCE fish which was to come. And boy did it come. The first plates of cod and potato pancakes made their appearance and disappeared almost instantly onto everyone’s individual plates. I started with three pieces each of the fish and the homemade pancakes as well as a generous serving of the tartar. At first bite it was clear, this is good fish. It was incredibly light and very flaky with a breading to match. I really think the breading could have used a bit more spice to it, but I am splitting hairs here – it was flat-out very good stuff. While I expected greatness from the AYCE fish, what I didn’t expect were the AYCE potato pancakes to be so good. While they didn’t have the oniony zest that Norm’s Hideaway pancakes have, they were no slouch, and the fact that they were AYCE really made me man up. What’s more, the addition of apple sauce and maple syrup only served to make them all the more inviting. When all was said and done I had consumed at least six pieces of fish and six (or more) of the pancakes. I was drunk on the fry and loving every minute of it, that’s for sure. Speaking of, if it were possible to get intoxicated on tartar sauce, Madison Fish Fry would be the town drunk every Friday. This meal would have been no exception as the Nite Cap tartar was right on the money. The bright white sauce was almost gleaming, and featured a potent mayo zest with just an occasional hint of relish and/or dill. It was delicious, and complimented the cod just right. With so much deliciousness abounding I hardly even noticed that our huge dish of butter went unused until it was too late. For one reason or another our table didn’t come stocked with any of the caraway-rye bread that I noticed on our fellow diners table at the last minute. It was a bit of a loss, but with so much fried goodness I didn’t feel too bad about it (however, their score will suffer a little since I didn’t even get a taste of it). Apparently we lucked out a bit and it was the first weekend of high school football so they weren’t as busy that normal, which might explain our expedited service. Reports were that a 1-2 hour wait is the norm (I bet they get a lot of booze out the door that way). Regardless, we did very well and were in and out in just over an hour, even though our waitress was a little hit and miss. Overall, this is clearly a classic Fish Fry and I have no problem highly recommending it. Sure, the place ain’t the Ritz, but it had a nice downhome feeling which really complimented the style of food perfectly. There’s no two ways about it, this Fish Fry isn’t just good, it’s great.

Bars, Supper Clubs and Family Restaurants are all fair game, even Country Clubs and Church organizations are known to offer top notch Fish Fry specials. Well, local businesses are not one to be left behind and the busy cafeteria at Epic Systems in Verona puts their mark on the tradition.The philosophy at Epic is to offer high quality food at great prices to entice their employees to stay on campus. I would have to say it is working. If you are lucky enough to know someone who works at Epic you owe it to yourself to visit on a Friday. Epic offers a rotating array of Fish Fry options each Friday, this week it happened to be Bluegill and I happened to be invited.The cafeteria at Epic is a large grab-and-go area with a beautiful, sunny dining space, definitely not your run of the mill cafeteria by any stretch of the imagination. That being said it is a cafeteria so nothing is made to order and when Fish Fry sits around it can get nasty quick. Thankfully on Friday Chef Luke implements a 5 minute rule to ensure that this does not happen.  I got extra lucky and was able to get a fresh batch from the fryer. It was 3 little filets, a large roll, coleslaw and tartar sauce for $3.50, with a side of fries for $1.50 more. I picked up a second helping of fish to make 6 filets total with some leftover bread and slaw. The total was about $6.50 and well worth it.The Bluegills were right on. Thin and a little crispy with a nice light batter. The Fries were kind of Cajun seasoned and really good as well. There were two options for fish friendly sauces, tartar and tiger, both were good and complimented the fish well. The reason for the excess beard was for those who wanted to enjoy their fish sandwich style, that was not me, but the bread was fine all alone. The coleslaw was super fresh and homemade but not really zesty enough for my taste.Overall this is a very solid little Fish Fry and for the price it is absolutely wonderful. I would say if you are lucky enough to work at Epic you should definitely be eating in on Fridays. Good fish, great price, happy workers.www.epicsystems.com/1979 Milky WayVerona, WI 53593     (608) 271-9000",2216,0.21616865079365083,0.5325753968253968

This risk is multiplied 10 fold when you talk about Fish Fry, since pretty much anywhere and everywhere will tell you that they have the best Fish Fry around, if you are only willing to try it. Well, I again found myself in the scenario where I needed to find a good Fish Fry, but at a place with a lot of veggie options. Since I had been saving the Atlantis Taverna in Sun Prairie for just such an occasion, I gave them a call to see what the deal was. On their website they just say that they have Friday Fish, but dont go into much detail on its contents. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that their fish of choice was lake perch and that it came with a side of smelt (yes, you heard right, a SIDE of smelt). Needless to say, I was intrigued.We took the short jaunt to SP and found a spot on Main Street right in front of Atlantis. As we entered we could not help but notice the festive décor which is somewhat hidden from the street behind the bright blue awnings that cover the windows. We approached the bar and were immediately ushered to one of the open booths by the friendly host. The Friday special at Atlantis will run you $11 and consists of four small perch fillets, four smelt, a bunch of fries, a couple different tartar-like sauces and a salad of mixed greens. I anteed-up and put in my order while my fiancée picked from the many vegetarian options available to her.The salad shot right out of the kitchen no more than 3 minutes after we ordered. The mixed greens were fresh and tasty, especially when coated with the supplied Greek dressing, mmm. I quickly polished if off and sat back to enjoy a couple sips of my New Glarus  Naked (Spotted Cow was not an option). I got about 2/3 of the way through the beer before my steaming-hot plate emerged. Even though the plate was sparsely populated I wasted no time in grabbing a piece of the perch and going to work. The perch fillets were paper thin and very firm. They seemed to be a little over fried, which is not surprising based on how little material was there. The light and crumbly breading didnt add much flavor either, resulting in tough little pieces without much to hang their hat on. The side of smelt was no better as they had a very strong fishy taste, but were also fried to a crisp. They were okay, but so fishy I thought for a moment that they were sardines in disguise.In stark contrast to the underperforming perch and smelt were the Atlantis fries. These homemade wonders were nothing less than spectacular. I would never have suspected that a Greek restaurant could serve fries this good (save for the Parthenons infamous gyro-fry-pepsi), but the thick-cut fries were delicious and served as hot as can be. The only drawback being that they were so good, and so hot, that I burned the roof of my mouth repeatedly. Perhaps if the fish had been more temping I could have waited for them to cool down, but in my haste for deliciousness I paid the price.Accompanying the fried items were two distinct sauces. The menu claimed a horseradish-lemon sauce would be along for the ride, but it mentioned nothing of an additional sauce. Whats more, I couldnt tell which, if either, of the sauces was actually the horseradish-lemon. The first cup contained a dilly mix, similar to the California Tartar I so despise, while the second was more of a ranch dressing blend, but was equally un-tartar-y. I really have no idea which was meant to go with the fish, but neither really did much to help it. As many atypical Fish Frys go, Atlantis followed by not offering any slaw or bread. The mixed green stood in their place, and while good, are certainly not enough to make up for these staples. After being so excited to try this Fish Fry I left with my head down, and my tail between my legs. The fish was in no way recommendable and I just cant see myself coming back for it. The fries were superb and the service was very courteous, but that is just not enough to make up for the lackluster fish and the lack of bread and coleslaw. Overall, I cant recommend the Fish Fry (the whole concept seemed Greek to them), but I would be willing to come back at and try some of the traditional Mediterranean specialties which looked very good and seemed to be very popular. www.atlantistaverna.com/239 East Main Street Sun Prairie, WI(608) 837-5700",4389,0.15987966653808236,0.4805489120340607

Things just didnt work out this time around.Usually hotel lobby restaurants pay lip service to Fish Fry. Sure, they have one, but they usually dont take it seriously  Twist clearly does. Twist has walleye ($16), bluegill ($15, and cod ($12) on Friday which displays a commitment to having unique offerings and something for everyone. They all come with a soup/salad option, a potato choice, some slaw, and ciabatta roll. The soup/salad will precede the fish along with the roll. The chowder is a little watery and very sparse on the clam. It tastes fine, but so much of chowder is about texture and clam quotient and this stuff just didnt divide correctly. The ciabatta was dense and very alluring...one of the highlights of the meal to be sure. We were early so the fish came relatively quickly, but there was pretty much no one there so I am curious how it would be if they got busy. The walleye looked the part, but was below average to say the least. It was a beer battered rendition, which isnt a deal-breaker on its own, but the batter got saturated with grease on the thick side while remaining crispy on the thin side. It was an odd dichotomy and pretty unappealing. The fish itself had a strong flavor and while I often talk about the enchanting musk of the walleye this was more of a Preferred Stock stink that an alluring Armani. It was skunky and just a bad piece of fish if I had to guess. Whereas the fish missed the mark the potatoes hit the bulls-eye time and again. The Russet Fries come frites-style in a big cone with a ton of seasoning. In addition, the singular potato pancake was great and had a nice blend of seasoning all its own. While it would be nice to have some apple sauce or syrup and another cake the lone wolf did well on its own. The fish would have been hard to stomach on its own, but the tartar made it manageable. It was thick enough to cover the imperfections with the fish and had a good zip that shifted our focus. It did all it could do as the soggy walleye needed it badly. The slaw was of the creamy persuasion and plentiful as all get out, but was just so-so. A real take it or leave it rendition. This is a tough one. Twist is a new place and theyre trying to class things up a bit which seems to be working for the most part. As near as I can tell I just got a crummy piece of fish which sucks, but does happen from time to time. Overall, we dont recommend this Fish Fry, but are willing to give it another shot in hopes of a better piece of fish next time around. There is potential here that one bad piece of fish cant destroy.  twistbarandgrill.com6617 Odana RoadMadison, WI 53719     (608) 833-0110",2753,0.07678318270423533,0.5472045011518697

Well, I was half right. It turns out that they do have a Fish Fry for lunch, but they do not have one for dinner. This is one of the few places I have ever heard of that only does fish for lunch so I knew I had to check them out as soon as possible.We arrived about 11:15 and were dismayed to see they were not open. It turns they aren’t open for lunch until 11:30 so we killed the 15 minutes in the Hilton lobby and headed in right as they opened the doors. The restaurant itself is very nice and has the feel of an upscale steakhouse you would find in Chicago. We got a table and looked over the menu quickly to see what our options were.The Fish Fry at the Chophouse consists of 3 Lake Perch butterflies which results in 6 nice sized filets. The actual fish was well fried, had a nice texture and was generally delicious. It was lightly breaded, and had a fried chicken style batter which really complimented the fish well. It is served with French fries (although that was not mentioned anywhere on the menu) which were shoestring cut and fried until they were orange and crispy. They were phenomenal, exactly what you would expect from a fine steakhouse. This Fish Fry was not without its issues however, including the “House Blend” tartar sauce which was really something else. It was an extreme amalgamation of mayo, sweet relish, dill, capers and God knows what else. It all combined to make a vile brew which actually made the fish taste worse. As Gabe said “…they should probably sell that house”. They probably also need to put the coleslaw up on blocks; it was some sort of pineapple infused goo that looked as bad as it tasted. To round it out they also didn’t give you any bread with the Fish Fry but did give you a soup/salad option. I had the Clam Chowder, which tasted good and was very meaty. This is a classy place so the food is a little more expensive but the service and atmosphere more than make up for the price. The Perch came in at $14 which seems about right. Overall this is barely a recommendable Fish Fry due to the terrible tartar sauce. The food is clearly of the highest quality but the little touches they have made to make their Fish Fry unique seem to have failed. The Fish itself was excellent and the fries were outstanding; when you get the big items down like that, just throw out a nice simple tartar, some old school slaw and a simple roll and you are golden. Instead the Chophouse has tried to “class up” the Fish Fry and wound up with a creation that just doesn’t work. This could probably be great Fish Fry, if you are willing to smuggle in your own tartar that is. www.chophouse411.com/Capitol/9 East WilsonMadison, WI           (608) 255-0165",2805,0.14133786848072558,0.5361961451247165

On our last trip Callahans Sports Pub the optically challenged little bugger got us, but he wasnt so clever this time.The lunch fish special at the Stoughton Ave stop is nothing fancy  a simple $8 2-piece  but does come with all the trimmings. It took my plate about 15 minutes to arrive at my bar-side perch and everything was hot so I cant complain about the service. The fish on the other hand, begs my commentary. On my last trip I was more or less pleased just to be getting fish (since I was with my vegetarian wife), and apparently viewed the whole experience through rose-colored glasses.  This time it was just me, and I noted every nuance of the meal. The cod, while fine, was a letdown. It was lightly battered, but inconsistent from bite to bite. In addition, one piece was large while the other much smaller. The fish itself was slightly below average  moderately flaky but not pristine, not greasy, but not flavorful either. The batter, while light, really needed a pick-me-up salt, pepper, something. The curly fries I chose over the regular option were also just so-so. Like so many curly fries before them they were cold in an instant which is the bane of this style of fry. Im not sure if its the surface:volume ratio or what, but for whatever reason, the curlier the fry, the faster the cool down.Following suit in the mediocrity department was a homemade-looking tartar that was very dilly despite the fact that the potent herb wasnt visible in the mix. Perhaps an abundance of pickle juice played a part, but whatever it was, the phantom dill was a real downer.Surprisingly, the slaw was semi-scrumptious, although it sported a soupy substrate. The creamy concoction was almost over the top, and perhaps I appreciated it more since I had to ask for it when it didnt arrive initially. The roll was just a roll, and a little crushed at that.While there was nothing glaringly wrong with this Fish Fry, not much was right either. Overall, I wouldnt recommend the Fish Fry I had on this trip, and likely wont make a point of coming back for it. The bar on the other hand might warrant a return visit. Its a pretty nice place, and the sports are ample, its just not a Fish Fry destination. thesportspub.com/1902 Bartillon DriveMadison, WI           (608) 241-0147",2376,0.10114285714285716,0.4763400488400488

The bountiful bird keeps well, and will have to wait until another day. Today is Friday, and we must use our superhuman abilities to locate an establishment specializing in fried fish as well as vegetarian vittles! Are you sure such a place even exists? I feel it is so, comrade, although it will take all of my power to conjure it up. Within minutes Captain Fish Fry, using his fantastic powers of communication, reveals that the Sports Pub has recently added a weekly vegetarian special to their lineup. Captain Fish Fry has long known of the East Side establishments Friday Fish Fry special, but the addition of veggie variable has made the post-Thanksgiving option a reality. The two are off in an instant, leaving the turkey on ice for another day.After tearing through Truax the pair pulls into the airport-adjacent Sport Pub. The frigid December air ushers them inside where they are greeted by the large, but largely empty bar  this is the day after Thanksgiving after all. They immediately notice the neon sign in the entryway which describes the Friday specials in full detail: $10 for breaded or beer battered cod, and $12 for walleye. The dining space to the left of the bar is practically empty, and the duo decide to setup shop. There they await their waitress for a few minutes.Well, friend of friends, it seems that a waitress may not be in our future. I will have to use my powers of inquiry while I procure a pint and see what must be done for food to find us. To the bar! Captain Fish Fry returns to the twos table moments later with a spot of Cow, and a promise of waitresses arriving in short order. Around 10 minutes pass and the Captains Cow begins to wane. Should I finish this Cow prior to ordering we would be well served to bid this place adieu, as service that slow would surely ruin any Fish Fry. Thankfully, no sooner had Captain Fish Fry spoken these words than their waitress came over to avail them of the menu. The two order instantly; one breaded cod with French fries for CFF and the black bean chipotle wrap special for LV. They relax, knowing they are now fully invested in the Sports Pub. Unlike the lengthy wait to order, the food is prepped in no time flat. The cod is scalding hot when served, indicating that it didnt sit long once it exited the oil. This cod could not be hotter, Captain Fish Fry remarks. I believe I may have burned the roof of my mouth in my haste to taste. This light and spicy breading blends well with the flaky fish, although some chunks of cod seem to be less than the highest quality. Overall, it is average, but quite edible, how is your wrap Lil Veg? I must say, your keen senses have come through for us yet again, my Captain. This wrap is simply delicious, and without your coaxing, I would surely never have tried it.  Ah yes, it just goes to show, you never know what you are going to get until you try it, so sometimes you just have to take a chance on a place like the Sports Pub. You might just be surprised. I am. LV remarked.  While your veggie gamble seems to have paid off, Im not sure the same can be said for our maiden voyage with this Fish Fry. The Julienne cut fries are fine, but nothing really special; although the portion is certainly plentiful which is rewarding. This tartar is a bit of an oddball though, its mayo base is punctuated by big chunks of onion. It tastes good, but the sweetness of the onion is a little strange to say the least. A standard, but stale dinner roll, and a side of slaw round out the plate. The roll is eaten begrudgingly, but the slaw is ingested to much acclaim. This coleslaw could quell most any foe, Little Veggie! It is rich and creamy, with the kind of zest you come to expect from a fine slaw. That is all well and good, but it sounds like your meal is just so-so overall? Alas, it is, my confidant. Everything is fine, but nothing really stands out, even though, as you can see, nary a morsel remains. I think I would still recommend it to a friend though since $10 for a 3-piece is a fair deal, and all the important elements are there, even if none of them are outstanding. I do believe Id be wise to try the walleye should we come back. Quite the opposite for me, LV chimed in. I love my unexpectedly delicious chipotle wrap, and appreciate the side of chips and salsa which fit the theme well. Agreed, CFF stated. Youve won this round, my dear.But in a way, Captain Fish Fry knew they had both won. Sure, he didnt get a top 10 Fish Fry, but he did get a Fish Fry he would be willing to eat it again at a place where his partner was more than willing to revisit. This is a huge win unto itself since great Fish Frys and vegetarianism dont often reside in the same worlds. Thankfully for our heroes, there are instances where the two unexpectedly cross paths, the day after Thanksgiving 2010 was one of them.  thesportspub.com/1902 Bartillon DriveMadison, WI           (608) 241-0147",5211,0.1688752177700349,0.5020954316686023

This goes not only for the places that specialize in The Fry, like Tobys, but also those that dont, like Smokys Club. Smokys is a Madison institution, and their famous steaks have graced University Avenue for lo these many years. While MFF has never been lucky enough to enjoy a steak at the celebrated Club, we recently had the opportunity to give their Friday Fish Fry a shot. Smokys actually takes reservations on Friday, and when I arrived at our stated time of 7:30 I found my lovely wife, and a Spotted Cow, waiting for me at the bar. We let one of the well-seasoned hostesses know we were both there and they showed us a table immediately. Our equally well-seasoned waitress came over a few minutes later and took our orders. Im sure we looked like quite a pair, a Fish Fry nut, and a vegetarian eating at a place that specializes in steaks, but there we were. She sped off (as fast as a 70ish year old waitress can speed) to put in our orders, and came back with some bread and Smokys take on the relish tray (a tub of ice with some carrots, green onion, celery and radishes). Smokys isnt exactly giving their Fish Fry away ($16), but there are a few additional perks, like the relish tray, that come with the price hike. As you might expect from a place that specializes in steak, the bread basket was very good. It was highlighted by the soft, warm, sesame topped rolls, while the crispy, mini garlic toasts were not far behind. The Fish Fry special at Smokys also comes with a side salad as well as a choice of soup or tomato juice (I know, right. Tomato juice?) Anyway, I went for the soup and it was pretty good, although not really memorable, while the salad was fresh, but pretty iceberg-y.  A couple scalding hot plates appeared about 10 minutes later and our main course was served. My hot dish was the perfect home for the three steaming cod cubes it carried. Try as I might, the fish was simply too hot to handle, and I had no choice but to break down and use utensils. The fish itself was delicate and flaky, and sported an equally flaky batter with some serious spice. Even with its spicy kick, the thin batter couldnt quite hold up to the Avenue-esque cuts of cod and the fish dominated the flavor. Due to the fact that the tartar portion was less than adequate I had a couple bites at the end that were sans-fish, and sans-batter. These few morsels certainly could have been better, although Im not complaining. Overall, the fish was delish. Speaking of the tartar, it was actually very good, although unequally apportioned. The homemade combo of mayo and relish produced a classic sauce which improved the bites of fish it did grace. The crinkle cut fries on the other hand were very average, and much less than I was hoping for. I was half expecting a fancier steak fry cut, but what I got was the run of the mill, standard Fish Fry fare. Oh well, win some, lose some.As we polished off our fish and veggie lasagna we realized that we had barely even settled in and were already ready to go. This can be attributed to the fact that the staff at Smokys has simply been there, and done that. They are almost curt, but at the same time incredibly professional. After having a few I dont give a crap waiters you come to appreciate their dedication, especially when it comes to expediting a Fish Fry. All told, we were in and out of Smokys in around an hour, which is nothing to scoff at on a Friday night in Wisconsin. Overall, this is an easy Fish Fry to recommend, and I would probably push it into the highly recommended strata if not for the hefty price tag. Sure, there are a lot of little add-ons but even then the price is not quite justified. Look at Tobys, similar add-ons (plus a dessert), similar portion size, and they only charge $9 for their cod.  Luckily for Smokys the atmosphere is pretty cool (much less pretentious than I anticipated), and the food is high quality, so I can still give them the MFF seal of approval. If they dropped the price a few bucks I would gladly move them up, but based on the rest of the menu ($23 for walleye), Im guessing that isnt going to happen any time soon. There is no doubt, this is a good Fish Fry; just make sure you dont forget your wallet at home. www.smokysclub.com3005 University AvenueMadison, WI 53705     (608) 233-2120",4428,0.14096500721500724,0.5044516594516596

Its hard to pinpoint what that is exactly, but theres definitely a mystique to it. Throw in the fact the Lakeside Bar & Grill on Lake Wisconsin has a huge sand pile to keep the kids occupied and its a sure fire way to start the 4th of July weekend off with a BANG!In addition to its lake-side location, the Lakeside Bar & Grill has a whole bunch of great fish options come Friday. From the $17 bluegill to the $16 lake perch, and $11 AYCE cod to haddock (which was not available this Friday), they really run the gamut. A full-blown salad bar also comes with all the fish, and while not huge, has all the staples along with a few perks. MFF likes to keep his salad pretty simple  some mixed greens with a little spinach mixed in, and the traditional Wisconsin toppings of bacon bits, croutons, cheese, and maybe a cuke or two if Im feeling frisky. All that gets piled next to scoops of creamy coleslaw, potato salad, and cheese spread, and flanked by cellophane-wrapped breadsticks. Lastly a cup of the Lakesides seafood chowder comes along to ensure all is in order. The chowder (while not clam) really tastes of the sea and Im pretty sure I caught a glimpse of some lobster and/or crab in there. Ooh la la Lakeside. Ooh la la. Were early diners in this day and age, and as such our fish always fries fast  tonights bluegill was no exception. Several hulking fillets loomed large on the plate and easily accounted for the 8-10 oz. that was quoted on the menu. These fillets were easily the largest Ive ever seen and while they had all the hallmarks of the gill (skin, musk, texture), I couldnt help but wonder if some other pan fish were sitting in as a surrogate.  Of course, I cant be sure of that, and while these were huge, they were nonetheless delicious and Id gladly get them again. My last hash brown experience at waters edge was less than impressive and while this rendition rebounded somewhat, it was still not up to the high expectations Ive placed on the Lakeside. The spuds were ultra-crispy on the fringes and loaded up with lightly sautéed onion and gooey cheddar, but it didnt really come together. The meld was missing and while I like potatoes, cheddar, and onions on their own, I like them a lot more when they act in unison. The tartar was cohesive however, and really put its mark on the meal. It was thick and creamy, with a unique pop that took the perfectly seasoned fish into the stratosphere. Its some of the best on the block, and rivals the best anywhere. Looking back there must have been a roll on the salad bar, but for the life of me I dont remember seeing it. Regardless, it wasnt really necessary as there was more than enough of everything else to go around, but one should have been on my plate at some point. Come by land, or come by sea, but whatever you do make sure you come to the Lakeside. The fish is out of this world and atmosphere cant be beat. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and think this is one of the few places that has it all. Sun, sand, and great fish; thats what I call a good Friday. lakesidebarwi.comW10960 Corning StPoynette, WI 53955     608-635-2959",3208,0.2327043650793651,0.5141838624338625

With that one simple question we were on our way to the Lakeside Bar & Grill and couldnt have been happier. Our son was happy, I was happy, even our resident vegetarian was happy because we were so happy (and at least she had a salad bar).  One big happy family on our way to a Fish Fry. We figured this might be our last chance to play in the Lakesides sand pile, but anticipated theyd be swamped since it was the Friday of Labor Day weekend. To our surprise we didnt even have to wait for a table, but even more amazingly Junior just wanted to run aroud and not even give the mammoth sand pile its due. It was unexpected to say the least, but the fish was everything we hoped for save for some lackadaisical service. Since the walleye on our last trip didnt quite live up to the hype I defaulted to the AYCE cod this time through. I was more than pleased with the cod during a previous encounter and was equally wowed this round even though the first helping wasnt smoldering (see lackadaisical service above). The secret (if you can call it that) to fried cod is a great batter and the Lakeside has it down. When their well-seasoned batter is paired with their flaky cod a taste sensation ensues. Lakesides version of hash browns with cheese and onion are called Ruskies and while the Swiss infused spuds are fine, I actually prefer good old American and sautéed onions. The Ruskies are still quite good, but after having them for a third time in a couple months they are starting to lose some luster. Of course, they also have plenty of other sides to choose from including matchstick-style fries which are seasoned beyond belief and well fried. Next time I might actually go for the fries over the Ruskies  blasphemy, I know. A thick and creamy tartar is fried cods best friend and the Lakeside sauce canoodles with the cod as well as any weve seen. The mayo-based mix has a ton of character and really drives things home. Since this Fish Fry is AYCE but still comes with a salad bar I decided to take the greens with me so as not to let them go to waste. I think this is a pretty uncommon request, but as things settled down our waitress had no problem obliging. Of course, there is still no bread to be seen on dinner or salad plate, but even that cant ruin all this Fish Fry has to offer. Most supper club kind of places arent what Id consider family-friendly since kids usually hate that kind of thing. The Lakeside goes out of their way to make one and all welcome and I for one certainly appreciate it. While its far from Shangri-La for vegetarians Fish Frys usually are and at least their salad bar has enough diversity to suffice. Overall, our family highly recommends this Fish Fry and think it has a little something for everyone. Its a solid 8/10 all around. lakesidebarwi.comW10960 Corning StPoynette, WI 53955     608-635-2959",2917,0.18325488541590237,0.4780454667742803

Sure, the Fish Fry is pretty great and in and of itself would certainly have justified the half-hour trip north, but that wasnt necessarily the reason (at least the only reason). In addition to a smoking Fry the Lakeside also caters to the kiddos with a huge lakeside pile of play sand. The mound comes with plenty of trucks, dozers, and diggers, and since I was on dad duty this Friday it was a no-brainer.The little man loves trucks and playing in the sand almost as much as his old man likes fish so I didnt have a problem with the hour long wait for a table  it just built the anticipation (and gave me a chance to have a few beers). When we finally got seated the sun was setting, but the walleye was ready to rise. I b-lined for the salad bar the second I had my plate and was impressed with how clean and freshly stocked it was despite the fact it was nearing the end of the night. I grabbed the greens and gobbled them up. The fish hit the table not long after. The walleye runs a hefty $19, and for that price you get a nice-sized fillet, although there are larger out there. The meat tasted fresh and was very flaky and home to what appeared to be the same batter as the AYCE cod. While the flavorful batter works perfectly on the benign tasting ocean fish, it doesnt do the walleye a lot of favors. It is a little thicker than youd like to see on a freshwater fish and really covers up some of the subtleties it has to offer. It was still very good, but next time out Im definitely going cod. Ruskies are the Lakesides version of hash browns with cheese and onion and this round looked and tasted hastily made. The dark loaf was kind of mushy in the center and almost burned on the outside. The tartar on the other hand was the bees knees. It was thick and zesty, and really enhanced what walleye flavor remained under the batter cocoon. Oddly, there is no bread served with the fish or available on the salad bar which is one of the few downfalls of this Fish Fry. Moms and dads all want great fish but if it comes at the expense of thier childrens enjoyment its usually a no-go. Luckily, there are places like the Lakeside that not only have great fish, but also go out of their way to make sure there is plenty of fun for the little ones as well. Overall, we (and our son) recommend this Fish Fry and will keep coming back until the sand pile vanishes under a blanket of snow. lakesidebarwi.comW10960 Corning StPoynette, WI 53955     608-635-2959",2578,0.17398368606701944,0.49513962375073484

These Frys are the rarest of breeds and only a couple places in the Madison area offer the anything close to this kind of variety, one of which is the Lakeside Bar & Grill on the eastern shores of Lake Wisconsin. The Lakeside has so many choices its almost impossible to narrow the list, but I made the trip for one reason - the AYCE cod - and thats what I was going to get. My stubbornness turned out to be a wise move. While we had to wait an hour for a lake side table at the Lakeside the view and the grub were well worth it. All the fish come with a trip through the salad bar, and while I didnt want to fill up on the roughage I still took a hearty portion of the respectable spread. My pile consisted of a good blend of greens and fresh spinach covered with bacon bits, croutons, cheese, and more. The bar also has some seafood chowder (which is pretty average), a sassy Tobys-esque slaw, cottage cheese, and several other of the usual suspects, but no bread (which was strange). Notes posted on and around the basin explicitly stated that diners should only go through once (unless paying for the AYCE salad bar) and try to keep things tidy (which I gladly did  no one likes French drips in the Ranch). Our waitress was superb and before the salad was expended the fish reared its head. The first portion came with three pieces which can only be described as spectacular. When youre talking cod its all about the breading and this stuff was light and flaky, and superbly seasoned. Im not sure if it was celery salt, season salt, cocaine, or possibly ambrosia, but there was something extra savory in it that was almost addictive. I destroyed the first three pieces and managed to get through two of the three that came on the second round. It was excellent, excellent stuff. The Lakeside calls their hash browns with cheese and onion Ruskies and rather than basic American cheese the loaf comes loaded with Swiss. They were utterly and totally delicious and left a little schmear of grease on the plate once they were gone so you know theyre legit. A thick and creamy tartar was a chip off the old block and when the cup that came on round two tipped off the plate nary a drop was spilled. It didnt so much as even quiver and its a clinger if ever there was one. In addition to the cod Ive had the bluegill at the Lakeside back in 2012 and it was equally impressive. I can barely wait to come back and try the lake perch, the walleye, and hell, maybe even the catfish. It looks like you just cant go wrong on Lake Wisconsin. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and will be back whether by land, by sea, or maybe even by air.  lakesidebarwi.comW10960 Corning StPoynette, WI 53955     608-635-2959",2860,0.178117816091954,0.5072509578544061

Well, as luck would have it, after weeks of waiting patiently the stars finally aligned  the wife got done with work early, wanted to eat right away, and was willing to have salad bar for dinner. Finally, the mythical trip to the Lakeside was a reality.Now, convincing your vegetarian wife to accompany you to a Fish Fry at a bar & grill is no easy task. It takes care, cunning and a little bit of luck. I did what I could; assuring her the salad bar would be top-notch (even though I had no such knowledge), and the place would be nice (even though I was also just guessing at that). We arrived pretty early, and were somewhat relieved to see that the parking lot was packed. I hurried us inside and found the bar busy, but not overflowing. No sooner had we ganked an open table than I spied the door to the dining room and went to put our name on the list. We waited the ten minutes we were quoted and right on queue were seated at our salad bar adjacent table - it seemed fate knew at least one of us we here for solely that item. We waited for a while for our waitress to come over, but she never did appear. Eventually the hostess came back and said shed be filling that role instead which was strange, but whatever, as long as there was fish to eat wed be happy, and believe me, there was fish to eat. The Lakeside is an equal opportunity Fish Fry joint if ever there were one. The options range from the expected (and AYCE) cod, to the more lavish choices of walleye, bluegill, lake perch and haddock. Since Id already codded earlier in the day I figured freshwater was the way to go, and settled on the sunfish as my poison. A trip to the freshly stocked salad bar comes with any of the fish options and I wasted no time taking advantage of the bounty the second our orders went it. The bar was well stocked with fresh greens, cottage cheese, coleslaw and the rest of the supper club staples. Some French Onion soup and a clam-loaded chowder were also supplied and appeared to be homemade. I chowed the der, enjoying it and the semi-soupy coleslaw in back to back bites. The only bread in sight was also on the salad bar, and although it may have been great when fresh baked, the garlicky critters were soggy, chewy, and unappetizing by the time we got to them. Just as I was finishing my spread the fish arrived, and was steaming hot, as it should be. There were about 10 fillets total although the bag was mixed with some being thick and meaty while others were skimpy and wimpy. They all wore a thin golden-brown breading which had an alarming amount of salt. While MFF is a man who likes his sodium, the potency of this stuff actually overpowered the smaller pieces, which is hard to do. It was much more subtle on the larger, flakier fillets as their moisture balanced out the spice to some degree. Quelling the sodium bite of the breading further was the moderately thick tartar sauce which did about all it could. The unique blend contained a little sweet relish, which perked it up, but lacked the desirable fortitude that some dill would have provided. While Ive never heard them called such, the Lakeside bills their hash browns with cheese and onion as Ruskies (at least I think that is what she said) and they have a slightly different format. Served almost as a loaf, the shredded spuds were piled high and cooked to perfection. The crispy exterior was golden-brown and gave way to a velvety starchy and gooey cheese interior. They were delicious and we would have no problem ordering them again. We have been to several places on the shores of scenic Lake Wisconsin now, and wed have to say that Lakeside stacks up with the best of them. The diversity of their offering is impressive and after seeing the AYCE cod flying around the room well simply have to make the time for another trip. Overall, we highly recommend the bluegill and assume the rest of their fish fall in line. This is just a classic Fish Fry joint, no ifs ands or buts about it. lakesidebarwi.comW10960 Corning StPoynette, WI 53955     608-635-2959",4182,0.1061309523809524,0.49836640211640215

Our last trip to the MTP was flat-out flawless. The fish was hot and flaky fish, the sides were superb, and the service was supplied by a remarkable roving troop of waiters and waitresses. This time hardly any of those things fell in line which was odd and really unfortunate since we had guests from out of town who wanted a truly tremendous Madison Fish Fry experience.Last time I raved about the solid service, and now I feel like I need to take it all back. The every server waits on every customer model that had previously worked so flawlessly broke down in spectacular fashion this time around. Yes, we had a bigger group, including four adults and two kids, but our orders were nothing out of the ordinary and certainly nothing they shouldnt have been able to handle. Lets start with the good: the fish came quickly after it was ordered and for the most part was spot on. It was hot and flaky with a rich beer batter that wasnt greasy. It was essentially exactly what I expected it to be based on my previous experience and pleased our guests. It was right in the zone. The thick julienne-cut fries were nothing special but were generously portioned and stood tall alongside the trio of fish. The same cant be said of the big paper cup of tartar however. Although it appeared plentiful the three hulking chunks of cod absorbed it like a Shamwow. Luckily, the kids only wanted the fish part of their Kids Fish Fry so the extra sauce made its way into my greasy mitts. This sauce is dilly, but not over the top, and does its part to ice the cod cake. You dont usually see garlic bread at a Fish Fry, but the Mid Town isnt your usual place. While it is unusual its also better than a plain dinner roll so Ill give it a bit of extra credit. Some average looking slaw with a slightly above average flavor finished things off and isnt Sysco as far as I can tell.So, the fish was fine for all intents and purposes, but while the three adult Fish Fryers were happy my wife wasnt. The veggie lasagna she ordered never arrived and the roving band of servers didnt come by quickly enough to remedy the situation. She took it in stride but by the time someone did come to see how we were doing (and drop the check) everyone else was finishing up and her lasagna was a lost cause. Her dinner consisted of a few bites of slaw which painted the whole experience in an unpleasant light. While it doesnt have much bearing on the fish per se, someone dropped that ball big time and I cant just let it go unmentioned. I still really like the MTP and some forgotten pasta wont exclude them entirely from my future Friday consideration, but Ill certainly have a more difficult time convincing my wife to give them another shot. Overall, we still recommend this Fish Fry and think its one of the best Middleton has to offer. Well just hope for better luck next time. www.midtownpub.com2405 Allen BoulevardMiddleton, WI 53562     (608) 826-5129",2981,0.16716553287981853,0.5028004535147392

Personally I try not to judge the a whole lot of anything based on one bad seed, but even I fall victim to recency bias from time to time. Such is the case with the Mid Town Pub. I visited the MTP numerous time over the years and really loved their fried cod. One day I decided What the hell, Ill give their walleye a try, what could go wrong? The cod is great so the walleye must be too, right? Well, the walleye wasnt, and ever since I have been gun-shy about returning. I should have known better than to let that one bad apple spoil my bunch. My return to the MTP came after checking their website and seeing the addition of several new and intriguing vegetarian options. I knew my vegetarian wife would be happy with them so we saddled up the Suabru and headed toward Middleton. The cod special goes for $13 and since we were early we had our pick of the litter table-wise. In addition, the MTP has really stepped their up game over the years with an impressive beer selection and all-around amazing service (all the wait staff wait on all the tables which is something I dont think Ive ever seen before  it really worked well). The most important part of any Fish Fry is the fish so lets start there. The cod is served in three LARGE pieces with a substantive, but not too thick beer batter. The batter has plenty of favor, but not so much that it has to be dissected (if that even makes sense). It pairs perfectly with the clean and flaky fish, and while there was a tiny bit of grease present, it was mostly concealed by the batter. While I like this kind of cod, and there is nothing glaringly wrong with it, it doesnt really have anything special about it per se. That said, this is exactly what 80% of the Fish Fry going public are after so I cant fault the pub for pleasing the masses. For me it slips into excellent territory because of the consistency and the universal appeal. Several side options are slung along with the fish and I, for some reason, settled on the onion rings. The thick-cut hoops host a crispy batter and were fried just right, but nothing about them really stood out. Likewise, the tartar does what it has to do but didnt leave me longing for more (although I did need a second of the small cups since the portion of cod was so mighty). Its a relish-dominated mix that is dillier-than-average but still takes the fish up a notch. A nice side of creamy style slaw has enough bite to let you know its there without doing anything funky, while a big old slab of garlic toast is untraditional but uniquely inviting. While I did see several plates go back to the kitchen with the toast fully intact Ill give them some props for taking the chance. It worked for me. The Mid Town Pub clearly has one of the best Fish Frys Middleton has to offer and I totally regret letting one bad experience sour me on them for so long. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and will certainly make it a point to come back more frequently in the future. www.midtownpub.com2405 Allen BoulevardMiddleton, WI 53562     (608) 826-5129",3113,0.15477798392084105,0.4445479282622139

It really is a nice bar, with (usually) really good food. Ive had several tasty meals there in the past but this Fish Fry just didnt cut the mustard (or the tartar as it were).Even during lunch the MTP was pretty busy (as any good place should be). As soon as I walked in I was greeted with a friendly hello by the bartender, and decided to just take up shop in his neck of the woods since he was so welcoming. He grabbed me a beer and took my order in the blink of an eye - the service is one thing that always shines at the Mid Town. The fish choices were somewhat limited and for some reason I opted for the $14.25 walleye over the much cheaper cod. While the price is on the high end, you get quite a bit of fish for your buck, so its not like I left feeling ripped off or anything. The single large walleye fillet was buried under a slew of fries, and a slab of buttery garlic toast so I had some trouble getting to it initially. The fish was also flanked by the tiniest cup of tartar ever, and although it would turn out to not be so great, I still requested backup immediately. After munching a couple fries, and brushing the buttery toast aside I got my hands on the fish. Wally walleye was densely battered and pan-fried. The breading was thick and dare I say, doughy. While it had some flavor, the thick pan-fried skin was a real turnoff. It really clung to the fish, but was also was kinda dry and unappetizing. The fish itself was flaky and moist for the most part, but a little tough on the thin end. While the meat had a hint of favorable walleye flavor it was totally buried under the beefy breading. The fries were freezer-fresh, but came in droves. While they were nothing special, there was nothing wrong with them either. Push. Even with a second partially-filled cup, the tartar ran out in no time. At this point I basically cut my losses and decided to box up the rest of the fish in a to-go container rather than aks for more. The so-so sauce had a bit too much dill, although it wasnt evident by outward appearance. It was creamy, and zesty, but a bit too much so - which isnt something you dont hear MFF say all that often. Per our notes: The slaw was good. Not much to say. So Ill just leave it at that. Lastly, we have the garlic toast which wasnt bad, but kind of seemed out of place. While it would have been more at home next to a big plate of pasta, it was still on par taste-wise with a basic dinner roll you get most everywhere else. I went to the Mid Town Pub because I was pretty sure what to expect  I was wrong (way wrong). The walleye was simply not done very well and I will definitely think twice before ordering it again. Overall, I dont recommend the Fish Fry I had on this visit, but I still like the Mid Town Pub and will give them a chance to right the ship one of these days. www.midtownpub.com2405 Allen BoulevardMiddleton, WI 53562     (608) 826-5129",2972,0.0831564433683078,0.43678907721280597

Weird, I know. Not planned, I swear. Mulligans Bar & Grill Montes Grill & Pub Mojos Sports Pub & GrillI dragged Jer, Zach, and Julia to the Midtown Pub, and as I expected, every one of them was surprised at how good it was (places located on the end of strip malls do not instill confidence in Fish Fry eaters for some reason). All four of us went for the $9.00 3-piece cod, and our attentive, but deliberate waitress brought the platters about 20 minutes after our orders went in. The fish was hot, but not scalding when she dropped it off, which leads me to believe her leisureliness may have exacerbated some time spent under the lamp. Even so, the cod was flaky, and flavorful. Adding slightly to the smooth taste of the fish was the Midtowns beer batter which was thick and held in more grease than youd like to see. The substantial coating was fried to the point where it was bubbling off in parts. It was rich and creamy, but dark and crispy at the same time. In our book it was just slightly above average as far as beer battered cod is concerned. Like the fish, the straight-cut fries were ample, but unfortunately the spud stack was a little under-fried. At first we thought it surprising, but looking back, perhaps the reason for the partially cooled fish was some tardy fried taters? Kinda makes sense when you think about it #protip - at the MTP you can substitute their homemade clam chowder for your fries - sort of a push in our book - however, what they dont tell you is that in addition to the cup of soup before your fish, youre still spotted a starch with the meal in the form of some (homemade?) chips. If there is one way to ruin a tartar sauce it is to cram so much dill in it, that you think you are eating a creamed pickle. A little dill can add a nice diversity, but too much can easily overwhelm even the creamiest of batter fried fish. You could say The Midtown is pushing the envelope to the edge, that is. Their homemade sauce is thick (which we like), has a good consistency (which we like), but is a little heavier on the dill (than wed like). MFF is starting to get accustomed to lackluster bread options, but once in a while something special comes along. In this case it was a nice little slice of garlic toast that somehow complimented the Midtowns dense fish very well. The homemade coleslaw was also better than most, although lacking that zip that really keeps you coming back for more. Good nuff, I guess. The fourth of the M bars was a lot like the three before it  good fish for a good price, but nothing to blow your socks off. Overall, this is an easy Fish Fry to recommend, but will likely never be a go-to Fish Fry for us. The batter is just a little too much, the tartar a bit too heavy on the dill. Maybe that is your thing? A lot of people seem to really like that combination; its just not our favorite. www.midtownpub.com2405 Allen BoulevardMiddleton, WI 53562     (608) 826-5129",3023,0.16101190476190477,0.48913139329806005

Most say it is all about the fish - the fresher, the better. Lightly breaded perch and bluegill straight from the lake to the fryer are their favorite choices. Others claim that any fish will suffice, as long as you have the perfect beer batter. These individuals deliberate over whether to use Pabst Blue Ribbon or something classier, like Capitol Amber. Still others proclaim that the perfect potato pancake can make a Fish Fry with less than spectacular fish stand out in the crowd. Then, of course, there are those who claim complimentary coleslaw, or righteous rye bread makes the meal. With so many Fish Fry options, there is no way everyone will agree on every little thing. However, when you take a step back and look at the whole picture, a few things come into focus. Regardless of what anyone else says, we think the clear cut king of the Fish Fry is cod. It is easily the most ubiquitous Friday fish, and whether it is beer battered or lightly breaded, when properly prepared, the flavors present in fried cod can not be beat. There is certainly heavenly haddock, and luscious lake perch out there that rivals it, but for the Fish Fry community, the lord of the land (or the sea, in this case) has to be King Cod. The only real debate seems to be over whether to get it lightly breaded or beer battered.If there is one thing we know about the Mid Town Pub it is that they do fried cod, and they do it well. On Friday they feature a two-piece beer battered cod for $9 with the option to go AYCE after 4pm. My two large chunks of cod arrived fresh from the fryer about 10 minutes after the pleasant bartender took my order. They were cloaked in a dark beer batter which was very crispy, and almost exploding off the fish. There must be some hot fryer oil back there The overall taste was good, but not quite what I would call excellent. The cod itself was nice and flaky, but had a fair amount of grease trapped by the thick beer batter. On the plus side, the batter really held in the heat, and both of my pieces were steaming hot until the end when all that remained on my empty plate was a coating of grease, glistening in the daylight.Accompanying the cod were some deliciously salty French fries and a small paper cup of homemade tartar sauce. The fries were perfectly fried and served in a fair portion, but like my other visits the tartar was minimal and didnt last until the end. The sauce was a medium-thick blend with some dill, but a good overall taste. It worked well with the thickly battered fish and held its own, while not overpowering the smooth cod.While they dont serve the traditional rye at their Fry, the MTP substitutes a fantastic piece of garlic toast that is every bit as good. Their homemade slaw is also non-traditional, and has improved, but is still a little raw for my tastes. Everyone seems to agree that the best part about the MTP is the great service you receive each and every time you go there. The bartenders and wait staff are ultra friendly folks who know the locals and call them by first name. Dont let that fool you though; unlike some other places, they act just as nice to the non-regulars as they do to the everyday crowd. On each of my four visits (I came once to watch sports on a Sunday) the service has been fast, and courteous, without a hint of resentment.  The Mid Town Pub pays their penance to King Cod admirably, and while it isnt perfect by any means, it is a well rounded Fish Fry. Along with the fish, the fries and toast are very good. The tartar supports the fish well, and the coleslaw is homemade and fresh, which is just enough. To top it off, the place is clean, well lit, and well staffed. Overall, this remains an easy Fish Fry to recommend. We will be back any time we are in need of a quality lunch hour Fish Fry, although we should probably try to make it an AYCE dinner at some point too. www.midtownpub.com2405 Allen BoulevardMiddleton, WI 53562     (608) 826-5129",3984,0.2962020905923345,0.5312601626016262

The Mid Town Pub (MTP) on Allen is the new kid on the block but already seems to have a better Fish Fry philosophy than some of its long standing competitors like the BSR or the Club Tavern. The mantra seems to be “freshly prepared” which is a far cry from what some places call Fish Fry. Rather than cutting corners they have their cooks there early and ready to prepare a fresh, homemade Fish Fry. That is the way it should, no, needs to be if you want to be the best. We arrived around 12:30 and grabbed some stools at the bar. Since I had the cod not long ago I figured I would delve deeper and try the walleye which is a little more expensive. The fish came about 10 minutes after ordering and was piping hot. The two large filets had a crumbly cornmeal style batter which walleye usually does. This batter was nothing special but clearly homemade and a fair compliment to the well cooked walleye underneath. The actual fish was tasty but way too much to try to consume for lunch. Perhaps a ½ sized lunch portion is in order? When the waitress dropped of the fish I could see instantly that the tiny cup of tartar would not suffice so I immediately requested a backup, to which she brought two. The homemade tartar was not perfect but certainly acceptable, even with a little dill. The French fries were also perfectly acceptable. They were just as I remembered, and plentiful especially considering the lavish amount of fish. Since most of the sauces at the MTP and salads are homemade I have to assume the slaw is too. Unfortunately this may be a case where Sysco knows best. The Mid Town slaw is a dry, raw tasting concoction of cabbage, onion and some other non-appetizing items that just do not blend well. The Texas garlic toast that came along for the ride was just fine though, even if it was a little limp by the time I got to it.After a second visit (and second fish option) I can say that this is a fine little Fish Fry. There is nothing truly mind blowing but everything is done well. The food is good, the atmosphere is nice, and the place is clean and friendly. The service has also been great on both visits and the cooks and wait staff seem genuinely concerned about their patron’s satisfaction. Overall I have no problem recommending this Fish Fry but will probably go for the cod over walleye in the future. www.midtownpub.com2405 Allen BoulevardMiddleton, WI 53562     (608) 826-5129",2523,0.14830517966881604,0.4901625647080192

I immediately went online to see what this “Mid Town Pub” had to offer and was pleased to see their special Friday menu had a couple tantalizing Fish Fry options. We arrived at the Mid Town about 11:30, hungry for lunch and thirsty for a cool brew. We sat at the bar and had a good view of the clean looking kitchen. Besides the bartender and the two server types, it was pretty much just two folks running the show but doing wonderful job at it. The kitchen was a well choreographed ballet of frying, plating and washing. The Mid Town Pub has a lot of options but basically the Fish Fry choices boil down to cod and walleye. I went for the two piece cod for $7.75 (AYCE available after 3pm). The fish was fine and had a nice texture but lacked any distinctive taste. The homemade batter was light and flaky and complimented the fish well but was also slightly bland.  The French fries were also very average. They were straight cut and relatively plain but complimented the fish just fine. The tartar also complimented the fish and was good although the tiny portion had me tearing open my paper cup to scrape the last little bit. The main elements of this Fish Fry were good enough. The fish, fries, and tarter all passed the test, leaving the Mid Town was in good shape. Sometimes when places have these three elements squared away they feel the need to get wild and wacky with the slaw and bread and it can ruin the overall experience. The Mid Town subscribes to the philosophy but does a good job of not going too far. The slaw was homemade with chunks of green pepper and red onion. It was not creamy and I didn’t enjoy it but others certainly might. The garlic toast served was simply awesome and I think pretty much everyone would agree.The Mid Town is the first place I have seen billed as a “WiFi Bar” in the Madison area. It is a new place so it still looks very nice. The food follows suit, it is clean, straight forward and non-offensive. There is really nothing threatening which leaves you with little to worry about. In addition, since the place is new you can feel pretty confident the tap beer is good and my draft Spotted Cow was clean and cold. Overall this is a good Fish Fry which is easy to recommend. www.midtownpub.com2405 Allen BoulevardMiddleton, WI 53562     (608) 826-5129",2433,0.22843778443778442,0.5001756021756022

Many of the newer business oriented hotels dont even have them anymore. Usually this place is a Bennigans, or some other chain, that offers inoffensive you know what you are gonna get kind of stuff. I dont think Im off base in saying that these kinds of places are not known for their classic Fish Fry, thus we usually avoid them at all costs. Well, the Crowne Plaza on East Wash has recently undergone some remodeling and along with it a new lobby bar has moved in.Growlers Bar and Grille is the new kid on the Fish Fry scene and a far cry from your typical lobby restaurant. Growlers is far more upscale (looking) than an Applebees or Fridays and seems to fit the Crowne Plaza better than one of those kinds of places would. As we approached the building the gigantic automated revolving door gently ushered us inside and practically spit us right into the deserted bar. This was the day after Thanksgiving so I didnt really expect for the place to be packed, but I did figure there would be more than the six or so random travelers who were content to sit in isolated bunches sipping cocktails. We basically had our choice of tables and chose one out in the open so as to see as much of the action as there was to see.As we sat down the bartender/host/waiter brought us over a couple of menus and went to get us some drinks. The only Fish Fry option is their Wisconsin Perch Fry which comes in at a whopping $18 and does not, I repeat, DOES NOT come with French fries. Oh well, I thought, maybe it will be simply awesome and worth the huge price tag; wishful thinking, I know. I gave him the order and sat back to enjoy my cold, crisp ($5.10!) pint of Spotted Cow.The fish came out about 20 minutes or so after we ordered which I thought was strange since we were the only people in the place eating. I would have assumed it would have been ready in 5-10 minutes since fish fries quickly and our only other item was a salad. For your eighteen bucks you do get 10 pieces of perch which is quite a bit of food. While the fillets were smallish they were covered in a heavy beer batter which made them much more substantial. The batter was thick and creamy to the point where the fish underneath was almost unnoticeable. It also had some rosemary or something sprinkled on which didnt really do much to help. Overall, it tasted good but was not great. It was also not scalding hot when served which didnt help.The tartar sauce also didnt lend a hand. While the base of it was good, they clearly put far too much lemon juice in it to the point where it dominated the flavor. The relish and capers were powerless against this lemon coup and faded unceremoniously into the background. My fish suffered without its most important ally.Any real Fish Fry must have a potato option on the side. Since I realized that Growlers was going to stiff me on this one, I made sure to get and order of the beer fries on the side (for an extra $4). These thick cut beauties were the highlight of the meal bust since they are not included in the standard Fish Fry I cant give them any credit for them. I will give them credit for the Door County cherry slaw and the marble rye bread. Both were good although the slaw tasted more like it should have been called Horseradish County slaw and the rye was kind of limp and lifeless, but still traditional. With a name like Growlers I expected this place to be more like a sports bar. Take it from me, it is not, and these are definitely not sports bar prices. The fish was slightly below average and I simply cant recommend it at that price. With the thick batter the 10 fillets were too much to eat and I would gladly have sacrificed a couple pieces of fish for a pile of the beer fries. This is yet another case of trying to class up a Fish Fry that hasnt quite worked. For starters, an $18 Fish Fry is unheard of; maybe if you were offering AYCE walleye or something, but for perch, with no fries? No way. Simply adding two slices of marble rye and special coleslaw does not make up that difference especially since those are Fish Fry standards anyway. Growlers Bar and Grille (what is up with putting the e on the end of Grill? Is it to make it sound fancier so you can charge more?) has some work to do before I would ever feel comfortable recommending their Fish Fry. More bang, for less buck, would be a good place to start.Perch with tartar, coleslaw and bread - $18.00Beer fries (not included) $4.00Spotted Cow $5.10Total of $27.10 (not including tip) Park Side Pub Cod with tartar, coleslaw, bread AND fries - $7.00Spotted Cow $3.00Total of $10.004402 East Washington AvenueMadison, WI(608) 244-4703",4732,0.1294497327167782,0.5104162567230748

Well, luckily for me right during the lunch hour a rain shower decided to pass through. Since no one likes to eat in the rain we headed up to Nordic Lanes in Westby to get dry and grab a bite. At this point I didn’t even realize what day it was and was more than thrilled when we arrived and saw the Fish special listed on the neon board. I had heard the Nordic Fish Fry was actually really good and was kind of psyched up to give it a whirl. When I asked the waitress if it was freshly battered and she said it was, it sealed the deal and a two piece was quickly ordered. There was also an option for a three piece for $9.50 but I was more than satisfied with the $8.50 that was spent since it was lunch. Before the fish I got to choose from coleslaw, cottage cheese or a house salad, and for some reason (unbeknownst to even me) I chose the slaw. It was not really good although it was very creamy. My brother actually got a side order with his burger and really liked it and had no problem polishing off my leftovers as well. Their burgers and my fish came about 10 minutes after we put our orders in and looked absolutely delicious.The two pieces of beer battered cod were fairly good sized and actually lived up to the hype. The dark batter was certainly fresh and while it clearly had some “fryer crud” left on it was light and extremely flaky. The cod was also light and flaky and cooked very well. When combined with the spot on tartar sauce it made for an idyllic Fish Fry combination. Although I could have used a bit more of the tartar sauce since the cup was teensy weensy and not even filled to the brim.I got the “brew fries” since I have had them in the past and they were really good but this time I had a real mixed bag. They were not as heavily seasoned and some were nice and hot while one of two were totally cold which makes me think there was some batch mixing going on in the kitchen which is unacceptable. Regardless, there were a ton of them and they were fine overall as are the regular fries and the curly options.The roll that came along for the ride was purely there for show. It was hard, kind of stale and just tasteless and kind of a let down when compared to the rest of the meal. Even Sean didn’t want to finish it.Overall, I was very impressed with the Nordic Lanes Fish Fry. The fish was very good and the service was great since we were about the only ones eating at the Lanes around 11:30. If you happen to find yourself in Westby and hungry for a Fish Fry you could certainly do a lot worse than Nordic.511 N Main StreetWestby, WI 54667     (608) 634-4000",2793,0.21726677805625172,0.5613926911295333

Sure, there are still a handful out there, but it used to be just about every Fish Fry was AYCE. Now even the places you never thought would give it up are - case and point: Rocky's Supper Club in Stoddard, WI. I grew up not too far from Rocky's, but as a kid we never once took the trip to the River for their Fish Fry. As an adult I try to get there as often as I can, but I have to admit I was a little shocked when we showed up this Friday and the words ""All You Can Eat"" were nowhere to be found on the menu. In actuality it was totally fine as the 3-piece with a side of their famous curds was more than enough to satisfy.Rocky's is a true blue supper club and as such a relish tray comes to the table before any of the fried stuff. This was a proper tray with plenty of carrots, radishes, pickles, and peppers to please a diversity of diners. A big old basket of rolls, cups of supper club standard coleslaw, and a dish full of pre-portioned tartar cups also arrived at the same time and set the stage for the curds and the fish which was soon to come. Let's start with the curds and get that out of the way. While obviously not part of a typical Fish Fry, the curds at Rocky's are apparently ""world famous"" and they tout them all over the Coulee Region. They are definitely good ones, but what really set them off was the shrimp sauce that came with. I love horseradish. The curds seemingly share the same beer batter as the cod, which is really light and crunchy, but not as otherworldly as the airy cod of my memory. This cod had a little grease leakage here and there and not a ton of flavor. It was still very good, but since it's not AYCE it does lose some luster. The fries were just regular crinkles and easily the lowlight of the entire meal. I mean, there just really isn't all that much you can do to make them great. Conversely, the tartar was sweet and zippy, and about as thick as you'll find anywhere. It was a supper club popper and really made the competent fish look much smarter. There was a day when places simply had to be AYCE just to get people in the door, but as the price of cod rises, and the alternatives just aren't that attractive (I'm looking at you Pollock), these places aren't given much choice...it's go 3-piece, go high (priced), or go home. I think restaurants like Rocky's are doing it right - keep things around $13, give people 3 big pieces of quality fish, and add a few perks like a relish tray to make them feel like they are getting more than just some fish-n-chips. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and will keep coming back any time we are back in the Driftless. www.rockysrestaurant.com/101 N Main StreetStoddard, WI 54658     (608) 457-2111",2764,0.17181878306878312,0.4433241192963414

At the bottom of the pile sat Rocky’s in Stoddard. Rocky’s was recommended to me by some folks in the La Crosse area and I was lucky enough to get to pay them a visit on July 10th. Since I wasn’t in Madison I didn’t have the normal Fish Fry crew and I tried to drum up some interest but didn’t find any takes for the trip to the river. Eventually I got sick of trying and decided to enjoy the solo drive and eat what I heard was some great fish by myself. When I arrived I was hoping the barkeep would just let me chill at the bar and enjoy my fish in peace, but was dismayed when he said I had to eat in the dining room. Apparently “When it is busy (like this) I like to keep the bar open” even when there are 10-15 open seats around the bar. Regardless I rolled with it and he at least put me on the list while I waited.My corner table was ready for me about 15 minutes later and the hostess led me too it. I was happy to see my lone paper placemat chockfull of games for the kids of which I certainly would have time to partake in. The waitress showed up soon after, took my order and grabbed me another beer. The only Fish Fry option at Rocky’s is the “Batterfried Fish” which is actually cod as you might expect. It is also All You Can Eat which I’m not sure was even listed on the menu. As I waited for the AYCE I enjoyed a “cool” tasting coleslaw and a cold roll which was nothing spectacular but just fine.As I finished the slaw the fish and fries made their appearance. The plate was covered with three generous cod filets and a mountain of crinkle cut fries. As I chomped  into my first piece of cod and tarter I was greeted by pure heat. These things were straight out of the fryer and not kidding around. I swigged my beer to quench the fire and proceeded to let me next bite cool before attempting that feat again. I could actually taste the next bite and it was phenomenal. It was so light and flaky it almost floated. The cod was perfectly white and smooth and when combined with light, crumbly batter created a divine taste. The creamy blend of tarter worked in perfect conjunction with the fish to create a taste which was greater than the sum of its parts.One element of this Fish Fry that left me wanting more were the crinkle cut fries. They were slightly overcooked but were still pretty good, although I bet they could have been outstanding if delivered on the money. The waitress did deliver and came at least twice to ask if I had all I could eat. She also brought everything lickety-split and was very pleasant to the one loner in the restaurant.Overall, this was a great Fish Fry and definitely highly recommendable. The fish was above reproach especially when paired with the tarter. The fries could have been better but the service more than made up for it even if the bartender could have been more accommodating (seeing as when I paid my bill those same 10-15 seats were open). If you are ever in the La Crosse area make sure to give Rocky’s a whirl, and maybe give their “Bleufish” a try. I didn’t but I heard a lot of folks ordering it and it certainly sounds interesting.www.rockysrestaurant.com/101 N Main StreetStoddard, WI 54658     (608) 457-2111",3278,0.23319376026272576,0.5398180076628353

Sure, we love to have a go-to place, but we look at that more as a fallback than a preference. A while ago we were invited by the owner of Legends to check out their new Fish Fry and thought it was good, not great. Well, after a year long hiatus I decided that last Friday was as good of a day as any to give them another shot and see if they had made any changes. They had.Gabe and I rolled into the Grand Canyon Drive eatery just before noon and parked ourselves in one of the many, many open booths. We were seated by an angelic waitress who immediately took our orders and went to grab me a beer. We both went for the fish special, with Gabe opting for the garlic mashed potatoes with a salad, and me choosing the French fries and a cup of clam chowder. The beer, salad and chowder came post haste and we wasted no time in diving in.MFF likes clam chowder, but usually doesnt opt for it unless it is included with the meal, we are glad this stuff was. At first taste it was clear; this chowder is homemade and a definite upgrade over a standard style coleslaw. While it wasnt overflowing with clam, it was nice and thick and was loaded with all sorts of interesting ingredients. Gabes salad also looked nice and fresh although it certainly wasnt unique in any way. Advantage  chowder. I polished off the soup in no time and a few minutes later the Fish Fry appeared, and man, did it look scrumptious. A year ago the fish was haddock, and while there is a chance this fish was too, I am betting on a change to cod. It was served as three nice sized fillets with a tasty beer batter that was not too thick. The fish itself was nice and light (not greasy), but for some reason was not incredibly flaky. The overall taste sensation was really good, and bordering on excellence.The French fries came on a separate plate (supper club style) and were scalding hot when served. The Julienne cut beauties were perfectly fried and while the flavor wasnt out of this world it was vastly superior to a standard crinkle cut. The tartar sauce was also vastly superior to what I was expecting since on our first visit we were greeted by a dilly mess. The updated sauce of today was much more in line with what I expect at a Fry  a rich mayo blend with a hefty portion of relish. This stuff really gave the fish some zest, maybe even a little too much (skimpy on the relish, they were not, but I aint complainin). Putting the finishing touches on this luscious lunch was some corn on the cob (no sh*t) and some kind of maple syrup toast. The toast was a bit of a regression from the fancy bread they served last time, but the corn was a great addition. It was nice and sweet and the half-ear was a perfect amount when added to the meal. It was a satisfying bonus and certainly garners a little love from us.There is nothing like a full-fledged Fish Fry served lightning quick by an attentive server. In fact our waitress came back at least five times to check and see how we were doing (although at least two of the visits were to clarify soup/salad and fried/baked), but I still give her credit. Overall, this is an easy Fish Fry to recommend and with all the little perks I would almost say highly so. They certainly have made a lot of changes (almost all for the better) and are really offering a crowd pleaser at this point. Our last trip, we mentioned that a few minor changes could make this Fish Fry renowned and I think they may have achieved that goal. Well be back for some legendary fish at Legends before long, bet on that. www.legendssportsbarmadison.com/439 Grand Canyon DriveMadison, WI 53719     (608) 831-4463",3671,0.24599420127197896,0.5256479254627403

Since I hate to miss a week (because there are only so many) I knew I had to try to squeeze one in somewhere. When our departure time got pushed back I leapt at the opportunity to grab a quick bite and sped towards West Town Mall and the all new Legend’s Sports Bar and Grill.The owner of Legend’s posted a message on our Facebook page telling us he was open and had a Fish Fry that we had to try. Since I go by the “If you build it, they will come” philosophy, when I hear a claims about Fish Fry I need to check them out for myself. I arrived at Legend’s a little after 1pm and grabbed a seat at the wide open bar.I put in my order for a Spotted Cow and a 10 dollar Fish Fry and was pleasantly surprised to learn the fish of choice was Haddock. Haddock may not be “traditional” according to some people (see ClassicWisconsin) but, is top quality fish and delicious when fried. The bartender took my order to the kitchen and grabbed my beer and some slaw. The slaw was just plain Sysco style but the Cow was icy cold and delicious.As I finished the last of the slaw that I was going to eat the fish arrived. It was fairly hot but, could have been a tad warmer. It had a decent batter although it was a little too thick which made the fish taste a little creamy. The fish itself was good but not as flaky as I expected it to be. Overall it was pretty good and the three filets were plenty for a dinner portion and almost a little too much for lunch.Accompanying the fish was an army of seasoned straight cut fries. They were well fried and complimented the fish very well. What didn’t seem to compliment the fish was the dilly-ass tartar. While it had a good amount of mayo the dill was far too prevalent for my tastes and didn’t do it for me. A lot of times you get the bread and slaw before the fish, Legend’s keeps you in suspense and serves their bread with the main course. It is some sort of cinnamon roll looking thing complete with a glazing, or syrup, if you will. It was actually really good and quite filling in itself. Legend’s is a very crisp looking place due to the fact it is brand new. The service was fast and very friendly, just what you expect from a nicer sports bar like this. Overall the Fish Fry at Legend’s is certainly recommendable. The fish was good as were the fries and the roll. While it was not exactly what I was hoping for, it is a welcome addition to the West Side Fish Fry scene and I think with a few minor adjustments Legend’s has a chance to become Legendary.www.legendssportsbarmadison.com/439 Grand Canyon DriveMadison, WI 53719     (608) 831-4463",2704,0.12750420875420876,0.49869127785794454

I got roped into trying Granite City (in the West Towne Mall) on a Friday and figured I should try whatever fish they happened to have. While they do not have a Fish Fry special, they do offer fish and chips as well as a pan fried walleye on the everyday menu so I figured it might be okay. It turns out GC is very similar to any other place offering fish on the everyday menu; usually when the Fish Fry is not on special it is nothing special, and this stuff fit the bill.We arrived around noon and were seated in the yuppie-ish restaurant immediately. The servers and hostess were very nice and prompt which gave me a good feeling initially. The kitchen looked spotless and gleamed like a pearl deep in the heart of the mollusk that is Granite City. This gave me hope that if the food wasnt great at least it would be clean. Between the cod and the walleye I chose the cod and had it in front of me in about 15 minutes. The fish and chips runs about 13 bucks and is served as three thin filets. They were coated in a thick beer batter which had little taste and really masked the fish underneath. While the fish itself looked like it was flaky at one time by the time it got battered and fried it no longer was. While it wasnt mushy, it was well on its way. It actually wasnt as bad as I thought it might be but when put up against a wafer thin battered Fish Fry it just doesnt compare.I went for waffle fries as my side and they were decent but the seasoning was very sporadic like someone took the season salt and just dumped a couple piles on them randomly. There were a massive amount of them which was nice, but when they dont taste great is getting more really better? Me thinks not. The tartar was actually pretty good as far as tartar goes which was somewhat surprising as I half expected some sort of dilly mess. Since it is billed as a fish and chips instead of a true Fish Fry you dont get any bread or slaw for your $13 which I think is kind of ridiculous, but whatever. There were basically no sides whatsoever which really focused all my attention on this fish which was probably not a good thing for GC.Overall, there is just no way I can recommend this as a Fish Fry. While it wasnt bad, and the place is decent (although kind of fakey) it just lacks anything that makes a Fish Fry great. The food was not up to snuff and the sterile environment left me wanting some character. While the fish wasnt great the other food looked good and I would probably be willing to come back and try something else someday. www.gcfb.net/menu1_appetizers.cfm72 West Towne MallMadison, WI 53719     (608) 829-0700",2746,0.14414753401360544,0.5519019274376417

I have often times found this to be the case when confronted with an overnight stay in my hometown. The last day of October turned out to be just such a day and I figured that I might as well try some fried fish at the Red Lion in tiny Victory, WI since their Fish and Chips was recommended to me by a good friend. The Red Lion is an authentic (at least as authentic as you are going to find around here) English style pub located right on the mighty Mississippi River. The owners/operators are actual Brit transplants straight from the streets of Birmingham. Beyond their thick accents they brought some of the traditional English staples, not the least among them being Fish and Chips. We pulled into the Red Lion at about 8pm, ordered a beer and looked over the menu.The first thing to grab my attention was the fact that the Fish and Chips is served two different ways: regular beer battered and dusted both for less than ten bucks. I inquired about the difference and was told that the beer battered fish was the traditional offering as you would expect it, but the dusted fish is much different. In his lovely British accent the owner relayed that this dusted variety was soaked in Whisky first, then lightly floured much like you find with the best Fish Fries. I was sold with this explanation and we each put in our orders for it. We took our drinks and headed to one of the open tables to await our meal.The food was ready in a matter of minutes thanks to the fact that we were the only people actually eating so the cook was ready and raring to go. The two pieces of dusted cod were served nice and hot with equally hot pub fries and a side of peas. The fish was actually very good especially since it wasnt a Friday special. The batter was light and fairly flaky as advertised as was the actual cod underneath. The fish tasted good but was not as spectacular as I hoped. It was still very good especially considering it can be ordered any day. The fries were also good but nothing really remarkable. They were essentially thick fry planes that were well fried even though they were thicker than average. They, like the fish, mixed well with the side of tartar which was surprisingly standard. I half expected it to be a strange brew of god knows what but it turned out to be on the level and very good.Since it was Fish and Chips there was no coleslaw or bread to speak of and the peas didnt really do it for me as I am not a big pea fan. However, overall I was pleasantly surprised by the Red Lion. The fish was very good while the fries and tartar held up their end of the bargain. While it isnt a Fish Fry in the purest sense I can certainly recommend the Red Lion if you have a hankering for fried fish mid-week. The Red Lion is a neat place being run by some unique folks for this part of the world. If you find yourself in southwestern Wisconsin in the mood for fish check out the Red Lion, good food and definitely A little Brit different.redlionvictory.com/default.aspxS6844 Terhune StDe Soto, WI 54624     (608) 606 2753",3129,0.17933300717547287,0.43920768728987913

There is so much to love that it's hard to describe exactly what makes it so great, but for me it's the sum of all the amazing little parts. From the rustic German atmosphere to the huge steins of beer, and the lederhosen-clad waitresses to the stellar All You Can Eat Fish Fry, it all comes together in the tiny little town of Roxbury. It's no secret that in order to have the full Dorf experience you need to be seated in Nancy's section (she's a peach); but our waitress Danielle was no slouch either and picked up where the legend left off. She took great care of us, and while she didn't have the bling (that the kids love) she brought a friendly smile and stellar service (which the parents love). She also had a basket of their signature fritters on the table before we even uttered the words ""Fish Fry"" which is a mark of a true pro. Since the fritters were on the table right away let's expunge on their virtues first. As per usual the little balls of deep fried dough had us swooning from the start. They were warm and supple, with a sweet and spongy texture that was complemented just perfectly by the ample honey. My god these things are amazing, and likely the best possible bread option you could ever hope to find at a Fish Fry. 5 stars! 10 out of 10! 100%! Dilly dilly! The Dorf Fry is an AYCE Fry and the first plate housed three small to medium sized pieces of haddock. While they were on the wee side, the slight stature is actually preferable since it increases the breading:meat ratio to near perfect proportions. This breading is whisper thin, and a beefier cut would surely crush the frail crust; the balance the struck makes for idyllic munching. I put the first trio down in mere moments and had a second set of triplets in front of me in no time. Like the first three this bunch got gobbled up thanks to the heavenly breading and lack of any sort of grease. It was a fish feast and although I plowed down seven pieces total I didn't feel the least bit bad about it. As a German restaurant the Dorf Haus specializes in German potato salad, but if the warm and gooey salad isn't your thing skin-on supper club French fries are also available (and also AYCE). While these spuds were well-fried they're basically just a step or two above crinkle cuts, so if there is one failing with this Fry I guess this would be it...IF there is a failing. The tartar game is tight in the Haus and this bold and brash blend easily takes the fish to the next plateau of awesomeness. It's thick as can be and like a cobra is impossible to shake once it's made contact with its victim. The basic slaw was also of the creamy variety and while it had some zip it wasn't nearly as alluring as the fritters or the fish. If you've never been to the Dorf Haus do yourself a favor and get over there ASAP, even if it's not for a Fish Fry. The food is so delicious, the ambiance so unique, and the people so friendly that you really need to experience it for yourself to appreciate it. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and only wish we could eat it more often that we do. It's arguably the best you'll ever have. www.foodspot.com/Clients/WI/SaukCity/DorfHausSupperClub/default.aspx?accid=195108931 Hwy.

They spare no expense, pile on the food, and really do things right. From heaps of haddock to oodles of fritters and nonstop fries, there is always more than enough to go around in Roxbury. It is a veritable Friday feast and one we make sure to hit up every so often.The Dorf is definitely a destination, but the burned gas is more than worth its fish. We had a hearty contingent this Friday, but wound up with a mere 30 minute wait (not bad since wait times often exceed an hour). Our quintet contained mostly fish eaters, although a couple chicken lovers slipped into the mix (the chicken is AYCE too). The Dorf Fry comes in at $11, $13 with the salad bar. Since the fish is AYCE I never go for the add-on greens, but several salad lovers in our group claimed it to be good, not great partially because there was no coleslaw included in the spread. Before the fish a basket or two of the Dorfs famous fritters found their way to the table along with some squeeze bottles of honey. The fried sweet-dough was warm and gooey, and simply superb. They are definitely the devil in disguise and you could easily sit there and eat them all night long, totally forgetting about the fish in the process. They are dangerously delicious, and the best bread option weve ever found at a Fish Fry. For those AYCErs who dont go for the salad bar a side of slaw will arrive before the fish. The Dorf goo is cool and creamy with consummate supper club zip. It is clearly made in house and blows the roof off the place. Eventually our fish and fries arrived, and were steaming hot. My first plate was packed with three fat pieces of fish, a cup of tartar, and a decent portion of fries. As per usual, I started with the fish and was pleased, but not overwhelmed. The haddock was flaky and pure, and totally grease-free, but not quite perfect. While weve become accustomed to the Dorfs fried chicken-like breading, the light coating lacked the seasoning weve come to expect. While it certainly wasnt bad, it didnt bowl me over as it has historically. Like the fish, the fries were on the level. The skin-on, Julienne-cut spuds were plush and plentiful, and offset the flaky fish perfectly. Whats more, as long as you ask, more will come with the second round of fish which really helps to balance it all out. Some homemade tartar also strikes a balance, as the thick sauce adds a creamy pop that caps the haddock with flair. If there was a failing to this Fish Fry it was definitely our waitress. She just wasnt around enough, it even got to the point where we had to go to the bar to get our own drinks. It was really too bad since Nancy (the Dorfs best) had the table next to ours, and was there every few minutes, getting this and grabbing that. Next time well be requesting a table in her section. Despite the lackadaisical service this was another fantastic Fish Fry at the Dorf Haus. The fish, fries, tartar, fritters, and slaw were all great, and since theyre AYCE we all left stuffed. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and will keep coming back to Roxbury anytime we want the best of the best. www.foodspot.com/Clients/WI/SaukCity/DorfHausSupperClub/default.aspx?accid=195108931 Hwy.

Well, yes And no. While getting all the fish you can eat is a good thing, if they fish isnt tasty and you dont want to eat a whole bunch, what good is AYCE really? I for one would rather have a smaller portion of great fish than a boatload of crummy stuff. Dont get me wrong, we love a good AYCE FF, but usually good fish and AYCE dont swim in the same school. That is unless you head to the friendly waters of Maiers Dorf Haus in the tiny village of Roxbury.If its Friday night the Dorf is going to be busy, and while your quoted wait time might be an hour, theyll probably get you a spot in about 30 minutes. While you wait you can sit at the bar, enjoy some ½ liter steins of German beer, and wolf down the amazing snack mix; but be careful, this stuff is delicious and will fill you up quickly Dont forget, AYCE fish is just around the corner.Your waitress will be a consummate professional and come clad in full German garb. She will take your order and immediately start bringing out the grub.  First to hit the table will be a basket of the Dorf Haus infamous fritters. The fried dough balls come with the Friday entrees, and when paired with a couple drops of honey are pure gastro gold. As with the snack mix, trying not to fill up on the fritters is damn near impossible, but force yourself to quit (if youre sweet, the waitress will bring you a fresh basket for desert). Along with the fritters some homemade slaw will appear pre-fish and be a perfect example of what slaw should be - zesty, creamy, and just the right consistency. Eventually the fish, fries, and tartar will make their way out in family-style fashion. The fish will most likely be scalding hot so make sure not jump in too quickly. The Dorf serves their fish in thick, meaty chunks  probably a good 4 ounces each. This fish, whether it be cod or haddock, will be smooth and flaky, paired with a spicy breading that elevates it to another level. At this point you should go full force and take advantage of all this AYCE has to offer. 5 pieces? 6? The only one controlling you is you, and dont forget, fish is worth more than fritters. Like the fish, the fries can be refilled as many times as you desire (which isnt always the case at AYCE Fish Frys). The Dorf Haus features a fine French fry. They are skin-on thick-cut julienned potatoes that are expertly fried. In addition, you can choose their authentic German potato salad which is surprisingly good. The warm blend come loaded with bacon/ham pieces, and emits a lovely BBQ essence. The house-made tartar is also near perfect with a creamy substrate and just enough relish to give it a pop without overwhelming the fish. As with most supper clubs the Grasshoppers are great, and the Old Fashioneds are muddled before your eyes so dont shy away from them at the Dorf. This is the first of our AYCE adventures and probably the most shining example of everything an AYCE Fish Fry can be.  Inside Tip: Fritter at your own riskThe fritters are superb and hard to layoff of, but try not to fill up too much since the fish is AYCE and amazing - you can always have another fritter or two after dinner. Also, try not to fill up on the highly addictive snack mix at the bar while you wait for your table. Lastly, this is an All You Can Eat Fish Fry. If you know you are going to want more fish after the waitress drops of the first plate, make sure to re-up before she leaves to ensure there isnt a gap. This works at most any All You Can Eat..*The Dorf Haus is in Roxbury. If you MUST stay closer in Madison and still want breaded cod try Tobys Supper Club or Wilsons Bar & Grill on Madison east side or better yet, if you happen to be around during Lent try St. Peters Catholic School in Ashton (the best Family-style Fish Fry in history).

In unprecedented fashion, the tiny village of Roxburys Dorf Haus did just that. After our first visit to the Fish Fry hotspot in 2009 we realized that this squad had all the makings of a title contender, and now, after a second outstanding performance they have proven themselves worthy of standing shoulder to shoulder with the all-time greats.We arrived at 8pm, and were not the least bit surprised when the hostess told us it would still be another 30 minutes or so before our party of six could be seated. This was no problem for our crew as we simply saddled up to the bar and began our warm ups. A few beers, and a couple of fancy-schmancy mixed drinks later, the opposition was ready, and team Fish Fry took the field for what was to be an epic battle.Mere moments after we were seated our head coach and waitress, Nancy, came by to see how we were doing, and make sure we were ready for the game - we were. Acting as own personal Mike McCarthy, she fired the Fish Fry Fanatics up with her genuine humor and snappy comebacks to the Yahn boys various witticisms. We kicked things off by ordering AYCE Fish Fry all around, save for our lone vegetarian who snacked on the ample, but not necessarily thorough, salad bar (no pickled herring? Please). Additional refreshments were also requested which Nancy curtailed and brought to the thirsty troops posthaste.  After a brief stint away from the table to convey the game plan to the coordinators, The Coach returned with a basket of the Dorf Haus signature fritters. Like Jordy Nelson in Super Bowl XLV, the fried dough was simply outstanding and took it to the defense right away. Our club put a score on the board early by emptying the entire basket of Jordy-bread, and kicked the extra point by asking Nance for a refill. She obliged without a second thought, and had the refill on the table before you could say Touchdown Packers!Along with the fritters came a family style bowl of homemade slaw, which was rich and creamy, but had a subtle vinegar zing at the same time. It was a true paradox for the palate. This special teamer added another dimension to the team, as the soothing slaw left us in great field position, and put the offense in a spot to take control of the game. Within 15 minutes of ordering, the O took the field and we couldnt help but notice of the mass of talent which assembled on the dining field in front of us. At least a dozen pieces of scalding hot fish hit the table, trailed by a full backfield of fries and veritable trough of tartar. I instantly snagged three of the large pieces of haddock and got ready for the snap with a few heaping spoonfuls of tartar. GREEN 18! GREEN 18! SET! And with that, the ball was in my hands. First bite  BAM! 45 yard completion inside the opponents 20. The haddock was on the money, just like our boy, Aaron Rodgers. The grandiose pieces were perfectly fried and coated in a superb breading which can only be likened to the deliciousness that is Kentucky Fried Chicken. This super salty treat combined with the flawless, meaty bites of haddock producing a transcendent taste that we honored with the moniker: The KFC of haddock. Like The Peoples Champion, the fish was nearly perfect and since it was AYCE, kept coming at us in full force. The incomparable haddock put it all on the line in a performance worthy the MVP. While the haddock stole the show much like the Packers aerial assault, the fries acted as our running game, doing just enough that they had to be respected. The thick cut skin-on fries were bottomless just like the fish, and served as a perfect compliment for our prized gunslinger. Like Starks and Jackson they didnt blow anyone away, but came through when they were needed most (the brief hiatus in between plates of fish). They played their roll admirably on this day, and fit Nancys crispy description to a T. The fish and fry offensive was unstoppable, and was well complimented by the Dorf Haus defense.The D in this case came in the form of huge bowls of homemade tartar. Having a great tartar sauce is akin to having a game changer on defense; if, for some reason, the fish is off, or the defense needs a big play, these guys have the ability to rise to the occasion and take the game over. Consider The Dorf Haus homemade tartar a Clay Matthews clone. While the haddock was so good it didnt need much help from the defense, the perfectly mixed sauce was there when needed, and converted a great offense into a championship caliber team. If for some reason the fish would have stumbled, Clay and company would have been there to pick up the slack. Luckily for us, the offense at the Dorf was flawless, and displayed their dominance with championship belts throughout the meal.Team Dorf Haus proved a serious point today, taking it to the completion on all sides of the ball. This truly is a lineup for the ages, boasting an MVP caliber fish, a solid French fry option, a game-changing tartar, and a coach capable of pulling it all together. By the time the game clock showed all zeros I had gone five for five on fish, with a pair of TDs (Tartar Depletions), and 2 FFPKs (French Fry Plate Kills). It all added up to a Fish Fry consumption rating of 132.1, and put this meal in the annals of history. It was a near-perfect performance by the Dorf Haus, and served as an omen for the following Sundays big game. Overall, we were thrilled with this Fish Fry and highly, highly recommend it. It was fantastic in every sense of the word, just as our Packers we throughout the postseason. I have no doubt they will carry this momentum into next season, and do our great state proud, yet again.

I had no idea where or what Roxbury was, so I quickly did a search online and realized that the Dorf Haus in the Village of Roxbury (just South of Sauk City) has been a local Fish Fry institution for years. Armed with this info I persuaded the misses, recruited a couple friends and headed north towards the rural German restaurant. The short cruise up highway 12 landed us in Roxbury in about 25 minutes. As we strode into the restaurant we were immediately struck by the authentic German architecture only to have it quickly overshadowed by the authentic Ninja Turtles arcade game in the game room. As the boys grabbed drinks and quarters, the little lady grabbed us a spot on the list and was told we would have to wait 30 minutes or so for a table. The time flew by and after only one round of TMNT our table was ready. We were ushered to our table and shortly after our waitress, Nancy, stopped by with a basket of fritters and in traditional German style headed right to the bar to grab us another round of beers. As she left we each grabbed a piece of the fried dough, covered it in honey and tried a tiny taste then another then another. Before long wed each eaten 2 or 3 and the entire basket was empty. These fritters were perfectly fried and tasted absolutely delicious. When Nancy came back we put in our orders: one salad bar, three Fish Fries, one Rouladen with Spaetzle and one more basket of fritters!We started in on our second basket of fritters and within 15 minutes the fish was upon us. The haddock was served family style and came fresh from the fryer. It had a great flavor which came from a near perfect combination of fish and batter. The batter was fall apart flaky but not so much that I couldnt handle it with ease. It had a hint of KFC-like spice to it which combined well with the light and flaky fish. The fish was great all by itself, but when paired with the tartar sauce a truly euphoric experience was attained. This tartar was dead on, a thick combo of mayo and relish in just the perfect proportion that complimented the fish without stealing the show. We put away the first plate of fish and ordered a second. This second plate turned out to be even hotter than the first which I wasnt sure was even possible, it was truly remarkable. With the Fish Fry you get a choice of French fries or German potato salad. This border war was easily won by the French as the slightly undercooked skin-on potatoes were easily better than the warm potato salad. While you can add a trip to the salad bar I dont see any reason to at an AYCE Fish Fry so I just went with the coleslaw which was creamy and had a little zing to it which was actually good. When all the fish was gone I again turned to the fritters, having one as my dessert.  If you are willing to take the drive to Roxbury I highly recommend you try this Fish Fry. The fish, tartar and fritters were absolutely superb with the fries and slaw not coming in far behind. Overall, the food is outstanding, the service is great and the quaint atmosphere makes for a unique experience. Basically the Dorf Haus has one fantastic Fish Fry, Gemuetlichkeit indeed.www.foodspot.com/Clients/WI/SaukCity/DorfHausSupperClub/default.aspx?accid=195108931 Hwy.

As recently as the spring of 2011 the BSR was running on all cylinders, offering a bunch of choices during the lunch hour to suit any and all tastes. Today there were two measly options (and one of them was a sandwich to boot). WTF, BSR?The only remaining real Fish Fry option for lunch is a $9 3-piece cod, so logically, that is what I went for. The freshwater options, which I craved and which abounded mere months ago, were now absent, save for walleye which is now lamentably hooked between two slabs of bread  fish sandwich does not equal Fish Fry. It was a Cow and a Cod for me. To the Retreats credit the fish came unbelievably fast, although I think it was because the lunch cook was on his way out the door and wanted to do it as quickly as he could. It literally hit the bar no more than three minutes after I put in my order, freshly fried and screaming hot. I gave the fish a second to cool by shuffling the cups of tartar and slaw around, then had at it.The first bites of cod were actually pretty decent, as initially the fish was flaky and the batter crispy. Things quickly devolved from this instant high however, as the thick beer batter stored some grease which took over the fish. The pervasive oil eventually totally penetrated the batter shell and led to the last piece being a spongy mess (despite my ever-diligent turning). The last few bites of fish didnt even get eaten, and its wasnt because I wasnt hungryIn the cooks haste to exit his French fries were overlooked and undercooked. The resultant spuds were a little raw, and a bit of a letdown. They were perked up slightly by a blast of ketchup and the occasional dip into the mayo-laden tartar. The supposedly homemade sauce was thick as the dickens, but could actually have used a pinch more relish, in my opinion.Also needing improvement was the homemade slaw which was just not appetizing in any way. The mix was bland and dry and, and like the last bites of soggy fish, remained on the plate when the check was paid. There was also no bread, which was expected, but is still no less of a disappointment.Well, it looks like the BSRs endeavor into the deep end of the fryer failed. It seems to me they bit off more than they could chew, assuming that if they built it, they would come. They clearly didnt come, causing the Retreat to do the only thing they could, and rein it in. Its too bad, because I thought they were on the right track, but if the patronage doesnt justify the Fry, it doesnt - you gotta do what you gotta do. Overall, we dont feel comfortable recommending the beer battered cod Fish Fry at the Branch Street Retreat at this time, and without the freshwater options on the table were not sure when well be back.

In general, everything was good, but there were definitely some areas for improvement. That was a late dinner and we were literally the only group in the place. This time we decided to give them a whirl during the lunch hour and it was a little strange when we showed up at 11:30 and the place was again, empty. It seems we are always the first or last (and hopefully not the only) ones getting fish at the BSR. The menu was all chopped up, with all sorts of things crossed out, and new prices written in, but I swear last time every fish option was eight bucks (except for the AYCE cod). This time the bluegill Reese and I ordered was $11, while Matts lake perch came in at $9.50, which is pretty reasonable all around. Since it was just us, the service was pretty quick, and we had coleslaw in front of us within five minutes, and fish within 10. Homemade coleslaw is usually a good thing, usually being the operative word. The substantial bowls of slaw appeared to have potential as two kinds of cabbage blended with a thin dressing to make a visually appealing mix. Unfortunately, that is where it ended as the slaw had a very strange flavor and finished with a subtle sweetness that was anything but sweet. Perhaps if we had some bread we would have been able to quell the taste, but alas the BSR didnt provide any with lunch.When the fish hit the table I immediately went after them in an attempt to cleanse my palate of the sour slaw. The 5-6 fillets were good and sported that subtle bluegill taste that you come to expect from our freshwater friends. Both perch and bluegill featured the same breading which was very fried chicken-y. While I remember the breading working well with the perch, it didnt necessarily complement its counterpart all that well. The light coating was a little underwhelming, but a hint more spice would really have perked it up and blended better with the bluegill. Like its sibling Retreat, the Branch Street brother serves thick cut steak fries with their fish. While the portion seemed to be smaller than what you get downtown they were well fried, so I cant complain too much. The great tartar, which is also just the like the RSR, was right on the money. The thick, creamy sauce boasted a serious kick and improved everything it touched. Overall, this is a pretty good Fish Fry, and we have no problem recommending it. Sure, there were a few detractors, namely the corrupt coleslaw, the lack of bread and a fairly small amount of fish, but by and large everything was acceptable. Now that weve had their bluegill we can say both it and the lake perch are good, but since it is $1.50 less and a little tastier, I would go for the lake perch on subsequent visits. branchstreetretreat.com/2644 Branch StreetMiddleton, WI 53562     (608) 836-7750",2895,0.08459217171717173,0.536712000962001

We showed up at the 8pm and the place was practically deserted  apparently we were in-between the dinner and bar crowds. Regardless, the bartender/waiter said the kitchen was open and to grab any seat we wanted. Since we were basically stuck at this point, we followed his orders and requested a couple pitchers of beer and some menus. All the fish options will run you eight bucks (which is kind of odd, but whatever), save for the AYCE cod which was a bit more expensive. The service wasnt exactly lightning quick so when waiter Joe came back with our Cow we were more than ready for him with our food orders. Since it had already been a decent day for me (a couple beers at the Shamrock, a couple at Gennas, and one at the Rathskellar), I didnt really care what anyone else was having and focused my efforts on my order. I was having a tough time deciding between the bluegill and the lake perch, but settled on the perch when told the bluegill was likely sold out. Just as it took some time to get our beer, it also took longer than expected for the fish. Eventually our plates appeared and were amply stocked with: fish, fries, tartar, slaw, Texas toast and broccoli. What? Brocolli? Yup, brocolli.Since I was starving (and slightly buzzed) I wasted no time and pounced on the perch. There were six total fillets (one of which was absolutely miniscule), and I made short work of them. The fish was light and airy, and teamed with breading to match. The breading didnt have a ton of flavor, but was just enough to allow the tender and flaky fish to shine through. Any lack of taste was more than made up for by the creamy tartar which helped to bump the fish up a notch. Adding allure to the meal were the thick steak-cut fries which were very good, and incredibly similar to the fries you find at the Regent Street Retreat. Just like the RSR fires, they were more than plentiful and bordered on excellence.With any Fish Fry you come to expect a side of slaw. The BSR slaw was nice and creamy, and appeared to be homemade. It added a needed dimension to meal and served its purpose well. While this slaw was expected and appreciated, the additional side of broccoli was not. Not only was it out of the ordinary, but it just wasnt very good. I would gladly have sacrificed the sub-par side for another perch fillet or two. Rounding out the plate was a very lightly toasted piece of Texas toast. It was actually really good, and I was totally devastated when I accidentally dropped one of my halves on the floor. Damn.Overall, this is an easy Fish Fry to recommend especially when you consider all you get for a mere eight bucks. The fish was good, as were the fries, tartar, the coleslaw and Texas toast. A side of broccoli, while not my cup of tea, was an added bonus and just goes to further the value of the meal. I guess we should come to expect any place with Street Retreat in the name to be empty on Friday. Every time we have been to the RSR it has been deserted, likewise, its Middleton counterpart wasnt exactly overflowing with patrons, and I may never be able to figure out why. Both places are putting out very good Fish Frys for fantastic prices. Isnt this what you want, people? I know it works for me. branchstreetretreat.com/2644 Branch StreetMiddleton, WI 53562     (608) 836-7750",3495,0.18130341880341883,0.5474358974358975

The Avenue Bar is widely regarded as having some of the best beer battered cod in the city and I can’t say that I disagree. They serve their fish in a unique way that seems like it would be very hard to replicate effectively. The Branch Street Retreat used to have a simple, tasty Fish Fry but appears to have taken on the challenge to replicate the Avenue style. This challenge has met with less than favorable results. Most places have long, thin cod filets. This seems to reduce frying time and lead to evenly cooked fish. The Avenue is unique in that their filets are huge and almost cube shaped, yet they are somehow able to fry it perfectly. The BSR has apparently tried mimicking the idea without getting the subtle nuances that make the Avenue sparkle.  The “hand-dipped, beer battered cod” at the BSR will run you around 8 bucks which is fair when you consider how much food you get. The cod was certainly plentiful but not great. Neither the fish nor the batter had a distinctive taste which made it kind of blah overall. It was slightly greasy and since there were some pieces of leftover crap from fryer on them I assume the oil hadn’t been changed for a while. The fish itself was a little mushy and was not trimmed perfectly. In an effort t to keep the pieces fat, some chucks of discolored fish got left behind. These parts taste funny, have a weird texture, and should really be trimmed away if you want to offer a flawless Fish Fry. Like the fish, the tartar sauce was also different the on my last visit to the BSR. The new stuff was a decent blend of mayo and relish which was just fine, and a dramatic improvement from the dilly stuff I remember. The French fries were straight-cut with the skins on. They were plentiful and about what you would expect at a local tavern. The coleslaw appeared to be homemade and had a kick of horseradish that I really enjoyed. I would also have enjoyed a slab of bread or two, and since I didn’t even get close to touching the third piece of fish I feel a trade could have been arranged. There is no doubt that The Branch Street Retreat is a great bar. It is clean and well kept, especially considering they have been in business for almost 20 years now. The service was quick and friendly which got us in and out in less than an hour making the BSR a legitimate Friday lunch possibility. Overall I just don’t think I can recommend this Fish Fry anymore. They have clearly tried to improve it but based on this experience it actually seems to have taken a turn for the worse.  branchstreetretreat.com/2644 Branch StreetMiddleton, WI 53562     (608) 836-7750",2669,0.14804210940574578,0.5241627312081858

Intriguing I thought, another Fish Fry option in an area where there arent that many to choose from. As soon as Friday came around I knew we needed to get them on the list so I picked up a friend, pointed the car towards downtown and rolled the dice. Unfortunately for us Zanders came up snake-eyes. Craps.  The Fish Fry at Zanders (the old State Bar and Grill) consists of two 4oz. pieces of haddock with fries, tartar, slaw and soup/salad for $12.95, seriously pricey for a lunchtime Fry. The food came pretty quickly after we ordered and was good and hot, but that is about the best thing you can say about it. The haddock was simply horrible. The actual fish was incredibly bland with little to no taste. It was very mushy and had a wet and slimy texture. It tasted like they battered a frozen fillet and simply threw it in the fryer. The resulting golden color batter looked firm but fell apart like wet paper mache. It was nasty and I could barely finish one piece let alone two. Yuck.The French fries that came along were covered in some serious pepper and were actually decent unlike the fish. The tartar was also pretty good, although it had a ton of random stuff in it that I didnt even care to try and discern. It did improve the taste of the fish slightly but nowhere near enough to salvage it.The coleslaw followed suite with the tartar in that it tasted okay but had a bunch of strange stuff in it ranging from green pepper to paprika. The resulting mix had a strange orange-ish hue but was at least edible. There was no bread with this Fish Fry but a soup/salad option was given of which I chose the Clam Chowder. This soup was good and actually the highlight of the meal which gives me hope that maybe the non-Fish Fry items at Zanders are better. Overall, this was a bad Fish Fry. It was just plain sloppy and is certainly a failed attempt at recreating a Wisconsin classic. There is simply no way I would recommend this Fish Fry to anyone and will not be back unless some serious changes are made. If you are looking for a great Fish Fry downtown make sure you steer clear of Zanders as the house is sure to win. $12.95 for that?

It is the heart of the UW community and a great place to catch a free concert. Although I spent many hours attending events and drinking at the Union during college I never really ate at Der Rathskeller. I was attending a conference in the Great Hall and decided that rather than trying to leave and get back I might as well just try the Fish Fry at Der Rathskeller and get them on the list. Der Rathskeller bills their Fish Fry as two pieces of batter-dipped served with French fries, Cole slaw, dinner roll and a 16 ounce fountain soda for $6.25, which seems like a pretty square deal. I went through the line and had my fish about 2 minutes after I ordered it from the college girl behind the counter. I took my tray of fried goods and proceeded into the dining room not sure what to expect. Although not specified the fish turned out to be cod, and while it was batter-dipped it was certainly not done so by the staff at Der Rathskeller. The fish was clearly pre-made, frozen fillets which were simply reheated in the fryer. It was much like the Glass Nickel fish which tastes okay but is not hand battered and barely qualifies as Fish Fry in my book. The batter forms a thick shell which is alright but not flaky in any way. The fish also is not flaky and is far greasier than average due to the thick batter.The fries that come with the Fish Fry are the same ones that Der Rathskeller serves with everything else. They are thick and plentiful but not really tasty. They clearly sat for a while and got soggy which is pretty much expected at a cafeteria like place. The tartar was actually better than either the fish or the fries and was kinda sassy and a very different type of sauce. It actually made the fish edible, but barely.The diner roll in this case was simply a couple pieces of whole grain looking bread which were just not good. They were a little stale and rather small. The slaw looked homemade but was pretty nasty and had very little flavor to speak of.Overall, this Fish Fry is not recommendable. The fish and fries were not good and while the tartar was, it was very un-tartar-like. The bread was underwhelming and the slaw was actually pretty gross. The best part about this Fish Fry is probably the fact that you get the whole shebang with a soda for only $6.25, however even that is not enough to make it recommendable. This is yet another case of a restaurant offering a Fish Fry just to say they have one with no real regard for what really makes a Fish Fry a Fish Fry.

I found out about a little place just outside of Madison called Noras Tavern which claims to have a famous Friday Fish Fry. When I hear something like famous in front of Fish Fry I assume that it is at least decent, and should probably be great. I knew we needed to roll the dice on them at some point, but was a little uneasy about hitting Noras this particular Friday since we had a sizeable group (including our friend KT who ""doesn't get to go out much"") and that is a big gamble when you arent quite sure what you are going to get. We didnt have a lot of other great options and werent in the mood to wait for a table at someplace like Quiveys Grove so our group took its chances on Noras. We pulled into the lot after our 30 minute drive to find very few cars which made me a little uneasy. As we entered the banquet hall my heart sank a little more as the place was practically deserted. I realized the odds were stacked against a great Fish Fry at this point. We grabbed a couple drinks at the bar and once everyone had shown up took one of the many, many available tables. As soon as we sat down the waitress came over and dropped some menus. This poker game was about to start.The Fish Fry special at Noras boils down to Walleye for $11, Cod for $9 or Ocean Perch for $9. I ordered the walleye with potato pancakes, and chose cottage cheese over coleslaw or salad as my side. We gave the waitress our orders and she dealt us a starting hand of rolls and pumpernickel bread. These cards were decent and set up a potentially great hand. After about five minutes our food was served and the rest of our cards were unveiled on their disposable plastic plate. I checked my hand to see what the dealer gave me. The fish was fresh from the fryer and was nice and hot which gave me hope. The walleye and cod were cloaked in the same batter which turned out to be a little too thick. It almost formed a shell that was very firm and didnt cling to the fish in any way. The crispy, dark brown casing was not really flavorful, but the walleye underneath was decent. It was slightly better than the cod which was equally tasteless, but also little greasy. Not great cards. The rest of my hand wasnt great either. The potato pancakes were actually pretty tasty although they were more like tiny hash browns than real pancakes. The other potato options looked much worse. The crinkle cut French fries looked like they came from the school cafeteria and the real hash browns looked like they came from straight from the local McDonalds.My best card turned out to be the big squeeze bottle of tartar sauce. It was easily the highlight of the meal, even though the relish chunks were too big and kept clogging the nozzle. It was a good basic blend which helped to take some of the focus off the thick fish batter. The last card, the cottage cheese, was a total off suit and I would rather have just never been dealt it to begin with.  When all was said and done my hand consisted of a bunch of random cards in all four suits. There wasnt even anything worth drawing to, so I just folded rather than lose any more in the pot. The service was good but with such a bad hand it was not enough to make it respectable. Overall, there are not really a lot of good things you can say about this Fish Fry. While the prices were certainly fair the food was just not that great, and certainly is not worth the 30 minute drive to Deerfield.  The fish was average at best and the sides were ho-hum.

Wait, gay bar? Did I just hear that right? Yup, you did.  A reputable source recently informed us that the Shamrock had pulled a total one eighty with their Fish Fry; jumping ship on the frozen pre-battered junk, and reportedly landing in the more pleasant waters of hand battering. As droves of protestors flocked to the Capital to rally against the Budget Repair Bill, we braved the chaos in pursuit if a plate of fish. We waited for the noon hour to pass (figuring it would improve our odds), and skipped down West Main to see how credible our source really was. I arrived at 1pm, and found my companion, Jer, cozied up with a Spotted Cow, and waiting for me among one of the largest lunch crowds in Shamrock history. Since I dont frequent the Rock Im not sure if it was actually a record setting Friday crowd or not, but based on my knowledge of the place, I have to assume it was up there. They were swamped with alternative and non-alternative folks alike, but luckily for me, Jer arrived before the masses and treated us to one of the finest tables in the house. It took at least 15 minutes for me to get my hands on a beer, and another 45 before we had food, but spirits were so high in the bar it didnt really even matter. There was a strange kind of camaraderie this Friday, and no, not that kind camaraderie either. Although, Jer was getting a few not-so-subtle glances from an interested onlooker at the barEven though it took almost an hour for our food to arrive, it was freshly fried, and nice and hot when it did. At first glance it was clear that deepthroat had not led us astray. The cod was hand battered, as advertised, and downright delicious despite the fact that the batter was kind of dark (a sure sign that the oil in the fryer doesnt get changed very often). Regardless, the batter was still very light, and had a good flavor which complimented the flaky fish quite well. On our previous visit they had inexplicably run out of fries, but it appears that they are doing a better job of featuring their Fish Fry at this point and are making a concerted effort to keep their own potato products in stock. The usual fries we received this go-round were of the thick cut Julienne variety, and while some were undercooked, they were very good overall. The extra thick tartar was also right on the money, and while it could well have been the Sysco-standard, it did what it needed to do. The small cupful was nice and creamy with just the right hint of relish, and actually sufficed for the three pieces of fish. Now, I know on our last visit some sort of bread came with the fish, but for whatever reason it was nowhere to be seen today. Perhaps they just forgot due to the rush, or maybe they phased it out to cut costs while raising the quality of the fish? Regardless, it wasnt there and we were not the least bit pleased with that. Somewhat making up for the absent starch was a generous amount of homemade coleslaw, but while the cabbagy-y concoction eased the pain, it couldnt dull it entirely. Considering how busy the Shamrock was the two members of the wait staff did a marvelous job; they were running around, taking orders, slinging drinks, and doing it all without the slightest hint of resentment. It was sort of remarkable, because with the influx of out-of-towners they easily could have been overwhelmed and thrown their hands up, but they didnt. They stuck it out and served every one of those customers as best they could.It is a beautiful thing when bears, twinks, queens and Fish Fry geeks can all frolic side by side in peace and harmony. While you might think a place like the Shamrock wouldnt have a clue when it comes to satisfying the Fish Fry contingent of that group, youd be wrong. They have stepped their game up, and are now pimping fresh fish, funky fries and a tangy tartar which are all very good. They are so good in fact, that even without some sort of bread this is still a recommendable Fish Fry. The Shamrock has always billed itself as a place for all people, and now I can safely say that includes those whose love their fish, fried. www.facebook.com/ShamrockBG117 W.

From the hipster-friendly Genna’s, to the cramped and noisy confines of the Frequency, these bars play host to Madison’s artsy and alternative communities on a nightly basis. Smack dab in the middle of all the action is The Shamrock Bar, one of Madison’s genuine “alternative” clubs. Like most guys, I figured I would never set foot inside The Shamrock, but when Gabe came with word direct from the owner that they had a great Fish Fry I was powerless to deny him the opportunity to explore his curiosity. Since Gabe is shy and would never go by himself I told him I would meet him there, and with any luck, maybe our friend Jer would make it a threesome. I arrived shortly after 1pm and found Gabe waiting comfortably at the bar. After snagging a beer quick, we moved to an open table right next to an older lady and gentleman who were enjoying a little Fish Fry of their own. Jer trickled in about five minutes later and as soon as he did the waitress came over and took our orders. We all went for the Icelandic Cod Fish Fry for $7, with Jer adding “the last cup” of clam chowder for a couple extra bucks.As we sat back and waited for our fish we chatted about the intricacies of life and took notice of the décor. While the Shamrock certainly isn’t overly in your face with the homo-erotic imagery there are certainly a few (not so) subtle additions that let you know where you are at. As Jer sipped his chowder, which appeared to be fresh from the Campbell’s can, we did our best to look past the festive phallic imagery. A few minutes later our fish was served nice and hot. As I suspected the cod was not freshly battered (the Fish Fry is not a Friday special). It came straight from a big bag in pre-battered, frozen fillet form. The strange thing is that even though it wasn’t “homemade” it still actually tasted pretty good. The batter almost looked like the same stuff that comes on a Chicken McNugget and tasted about as good. True, the cod wasn’t flaky and the batter was very thick but the overall taste sensation was good. In fact, I don’t think you can probably get better tasting pre-battered fillet, which is saying something. Moments after we put in our orders the waitress let us know that they were out of “their” French fries, but she could just borrow some crinkle cuts from the Paradise next door. These crinkle cut fries were not really great, but it didn’t really sound like the “standard” fries they served otherwise were much better. Gabe was being brave this day and branched out, trying the pub chips for $1.00 extra. While they were slightly better they were not a huge improvement even with the side of Sriracha Ranch.For some reason I had a feeling that the tartar was going to be spot on, and it was. It was heavy on the mayo, and a little sweet; it complimented the fish well. Gabe normally isn’t a huge tartar guy, but I could tell he really enjoyed this thick and creamy sauce as he ate much more of it than he normally does. He was in the zone. While The Shamrock may not be a “traditional” bar they do try to keep their Fish Fry genuine by serving up a slice of marble rye on the side. The slaw was also fairly classic with a semi-sweet flavor, and creamy sauce.Over the years I have come to expect the best in Fish Fry to be served by old school supper clubs and dive taverns. The Shamrock does not exactly fall in to either of these categories and likewise its Fish Fry is not exactly legendary. For $7 it is a good value and I do give them a lot of credit. The service was fantastic and I expected the place to be a lot “dirtier” than it is. Overall, this Fish Fry is still not quite recommendable, but it is very close. While I may not be willing to fully endorse The Shamrock, Gabe had no problem giving the place his seal of approval. He really enjoyed what they had to offer and I can’t say I totally blame him. When you get a taste for something you just go with it regardless of whether it is “traditional” or not. Gabe seems much happier now that he has tried The Shamrock’s Fish Fry and that fact is out in the open.www.facebook.com/ShamrockBG117 W.

Thankfully, Fish Fry abounds across our great state and no matter where you go there are lots to choose from and always local favorites. Since we werent too far from La Crosse we decided to venture to Syls Place in nearby Barre Mills to give their well known Friday Fish Fry a shot (if you are reading this and actually know where Barre Mills is, one point for you). The precise location of Syls wasnt known to us, but since Barre Mills isnt exactly Gotham City we figured we would just happen upon it. Eventually, the barren roadsides of county highway O filled with cars and a jam packed parking lot came into view. At this point we also got our first glimpse of Syls, brimming with hungry patrons. Luckily, we were able to find a parking spot right in front and as soon as we flung open the door the smell of Fish Fry entered the car. It coaxed us inside, and we eagerly followed.On Friday nights Syls is apparently the place to be, and they know it. They have a special system set up where you go and give them your order, and they give you a number. The rule of thumb is to then head to the bar and wait until your number is called. We crammed into the bar and managed to find a couple stools after about five minutes of standing around. About 15 minutes, and a few pull tabs, later the bartender bellered our number and we headed into the dining room.We sat down and started in on the slaw, bread and baked beans that awaited our arrival. The slaw was zesty and delicious, almost like Nicks on State Street, but not quite as heavy on the vinegar. The beans were fine, but a little mushy and nothing special much like the sliced white bread. The waiter stopped by after we started in and let us know the fish would be ready soon. A couple minutes later a massive plate of fried goods hit the table.The fish and French fries were served family style and fresh from the fryer. The cod was very good and adorned with a succulent batter. It was rich and had just the right amount of spice. The cod underneath was light and flaky. One of my pieces had a slight shrimpy flavor, but even so, was still good. The first plate went down without much of a fight and we requested a couple more pieces. True to form, the waiter brought back a whole plate of fish and fries which was at least as large as the first round. We put away as much of it as we could and I finished somewhere around six pieces total which was still not enough to kill the second plateful. As we have come to expect at an All You Can Eat Fish Fry the French fries were your run of the mill crinkle cut jobs. They were okay, but both rounds were on the limp side and just slightly undercooked. I still liked them but they certainly didnt stand out next to the fish.The tartar sauce did set itself apart and was a perfect compliment to the golden cod. The plentiful sauce was thick and relishy, more than likely homemade. The big squeeze bottle that stood almost full when we sat down and was nearing the bottom by the time we had consumed our fill of fish and fries.Eleven dollars for this Fish Fry is more than a fair price when you consider all that is included. The cod was superb as was the tartar, while the fries, bread and beans were about average and just fine. Some good slaw and some great service helped to round out this Fish Fry on a positive note. Overall, I highly recommend this Fish Fry especially considering how quickly we got in and out despite the massive crowd. We definitely got our fill at Syls.www.sylsplace.com/W4160 County Highway OLa Crosse, WI 54601     (608) 786-9008",3699,0.19998865592239082,0.4740530954988785

It must have to do with the sheer diversity of personalities and situations that those people are placed into. For whatever reason, peoples actions just dont always make sense to me. I guess that is one reason I like Fish Fry so much - I know what to expect and when something doesnt live up to expectation I can easily say that based on my experience this meal didnt cut the mustard. People are much more difficult, and what fits for one person rarely, if ever, transfers to the whole. People are not Fish Frys, I guess.If the is one thing I have come to expect from the Fish Fry at the North Side Kwik Trip in Viroqua, WI, its a good deal. For less than four bucks you can procure a complete meal which is every bit as tasty as the fish most places sell for $8 or more. Since I was in a hurry and knew that a dinner Fish Fry was not in the cards this week, I made yet another visit to the KT my first visit to their *new* location). I whipped into their massive parking lot right at 11am, and put in my order for a 5-piece. I moseyed around the store, grabbed a twelver of The Cow for the party I was attending that evening, and waited a few minutes for the fish to fry. As soon as it was up, I bolted for the door and was on my way to my folks house to eat.Exactly six minutes after exiting KT I dove into my bounty at the kitchen table. My five pieces were crammed tightly into their Styrofoam coffin and were nice and hot, but not steaming after their short jaunt south. The hand battered fillets were as tasty as I have come to expect, and surprisingly meaty, although a little of their flakiness was lost in transit. I ran through them at breakneck speed, leaving their once proud collection in shambles  they were no match for my appetite this day. Accompanying the five fried warriors was a squadron of wedge fries which were grabbed straight from the warming tray. Due to their lack of freshness they were less than spectacular, but were still plentiful and somewhat tasty. Unfortunately, since they came from under a heat lamp, they were totally lacking any crispiness. The tartar sauce was also a little off as the humungous cup was based on a thick mayo, but was over-saturated with relish, which totally dominated any and all other tastes. In the past I have been less than pleased with the lack of slaw provided with this Fish Fry. Either word has gotten around, or enough people have spoken their mind on the topic, but for whatever reason they now give you a big ol cup of the stuff although after trying it, maybe they shouldnt. Im not sure where this slaw came from (it didnt look homemade), but wherever it is they should probably send it back. The creamy mix was just flat-out not good. It was really bland and looked a little goopy. After trying to stomach a few bites I found myself wishing for the second dinner roll of yore. Speaking of the rolls, while the one provided wasnt anything fancy, it was soft and fresh, and right on the money. It was easily superior to the slaw, and really made the subpar concoction stick in my craw a bit. Overall, this Fish Fry is still easily recommendable, especially at its price point. Nowhere else are you going to find a 5-piece Fish Fry for less than six bucks, and if somehow you do, there is no way it will be this good. The fish is above average, the fries are good (even if they werent fresh) and the tartar is acceptable. Their slaw experiment seems to have failed, but who knows, maybe they are working on it? When all was said and done, I was as full as can be, and more than ready for a weekend with good friends in the countryside of Southwestern Wisconsin. This is one Fish Fry that is will exceed your expectations. www.kwiktrip.com1301 North Main StreetViroqua, WI 54665     (608) 637-2114",3942,0.12385358688930115,0.49107967429396016

Birds chirping are your alarm clock, and the smell of fresh manure being spread on the fields is your morning coffee. It is a festival for the senses and an exhibition of wildlife at its finest. From the pristine trout streams, to the abundant whitetail, the Driftless Area of southwestern Wisconsin is known as a nexus of naturalness. It is also home to one of the most intriguing of all species, the social butterfly.Prime examples of this species abound throughout the hamlet of Viroqua. One particularly active butterfly is of the sub-species, Bill Day. This creature gets around more than most, and if you make a drive into town you are almost guaranteed to happen upon it. This lovely Lepidoptera is a shining example of the species, and has the ability to bring smiles to peoples faces, and arouse genuine laughter with its various witticisms. We ran into the Bill Day at the local Agri-Center and it whispered sweet nothings about Fish Fry in our ears. It told tales of new bars in the area serving the Friday treat, and spoke optimistically of our previous Kwik Trip review. As quickly as it had come, it fluttered away to spread its musings amongst the rest of the small community. The next day was a Friday, and we made the trip to town again. This time it was not nuts and bolts that filled our thoughts, but a delicious Fish Fry from the North Side Kwik Trip. We phoned ahead, and were told our fish would be netted within 20 minutes. Upon arriving at the counter ten minutes later we were startled, but not surprised, when the Bill Day snuck up behind us, its full grin ablaze. We had a feeling it would be here today. The silken winged one was enjoying a fish sandwich all its own, and spreading tales of Fish Fry lore. We exchanged pleasantries with the prize specimen, and before long had fish and hand. We sped out the door, leaving the butterfly behind; free to spread its wings and impart joy on the townspeople. Like the butterfly, our fish practically flew home. The black bullet ushered the fried deliciousness up Main Street and into the county. Within 5 minutes the Styrofoam containers were on the kitchen table and ready for consumption. Since there was a slight delay due to the butterfly and a couple stop lights, the fish was not as scalding hot when we opened it as it was on our first visit. It was still very good however.For a mere $4.19 you get three fairly decent sized pieces of cod. Often times when fish sits in a container, as ours did, it gets very greasy and loses a lot of its luster. The KT fish was a major exception. Even though it spent at least 5 minutes out of the fryer, no grease accumulated and it still tasted great. I assume this was due to the light batter and quality fish that allows any grease to drip off and stay in the fryer where it belongs. That said, the pieces were a little limp, but the tasty batter and flaky cod still did their job. When you place your order they give you three potato options: regular fries, baked potato or wedges. Since we had a few orders we opted for wedges in one and were pleased we did. While the normal fries were very good, and in a much larger portion than last time, the wedge fries were outstanding. They were perfectly fried which made the inside soft and the spicy coating firm. They almost tasted like curly fries, but were just great being what they were. Next time, and every time after that, we will be getting the wedges. Both the fish and fries were aided by the tartar which was right on the money. The solo cup was filled to the brim and just enough for the three-piece fish. The rolls were also abundant as each order came with two of them, but like my last visit, no slaw was served. We would certainly have asked about the slaw discrepancy, but the butterfly had our ear, as it normally does, and we totally forgot. That butterfly is one engrossing little bugger.Overall, this is an easy Fish Fry to recommend especially when you consider all you get for four bucks. The fact that there is no tipping necessary, and that you can phone in an order, making turnaround a snap, only enhances its brilliance. As we finished our lunch and sat back, we thought about our friend the butterfly. He is the essence of this small town. He keeps things moving and spread cheer to all he meets. The good natured tales flow like water as it spreads the word of the day across its territory. It was only a matter of time before the majestic creature caught wind of the Kwik Trip Fish Fry. Now, take to the skies to spread the word my friend. There is big value in this small town.www.kwiktrip.com1301 North Main StreetViroqua, WI 54665     (608) 637-2114",4716,0.1681457011980268,0.518491605293931

A convenience store, a place you run in to fill up your car with gas, maybe pick up a frozen pizza or a Big Buddy. You arent going to find a classic Fish Fry at a place like that, no way, no how, right? Wrong.When a friend told me that the North Side Kwik Trip was the best place to get Fish Fry anywhere around my hometown I was skeptical to say the least. Since I take all recommendations on Fish Fry seriously, I knew I had to give her favorite spot its day in the sun. It turned out that Robson was right on the money and I was soon eating my words along with a delicious gas station Fish Fry.I showed up right at noon and noticed the parking lot was even busier than it normally is. I wasted no time and headed directly to the back of the store and found a trio of ladies manning the kitchen. I asked for the Fish Fry, they asked how many pieces I wanted, and after waiting a measly 5 minutes I was out the door with a $3.29 2-piece in hand (yeah, you heard right, $3.29). The Fish Fry at Kwik Trip is basically a take out affair which could certainly be an issue if you live a long way out of town, luckily for me I didnt have too far to go and my fish was still practically scalding hot when I popped the container open. I was starving so I immediately cracked into my first piece. The cod was clearly hand battered and was surprisingly good. The batter was light and flaky and simply tasted great. The pieces were rather tiny which made me wish I would have gotten (at least) a 3-piece, but the 2-piece sufficed for lunch. As for the fish itself, it seemed to be high quality and was fairly flaky although it did accumulate the tiniest bit of grease in a couple spots thanks to the short time spent in transit. By and large it was very good and a total stunner in my opinion.The French fries were also very good but I got so few of them they, like the fish, were gone instantly. They were straight cut classic fries which were perfectly fried to a crisp golden brown. The tartar on the other hand was in heavy abundance when compared to its comrades and could not be finished with fish nor fry. The solo cup was filled to the brim with the thick and creamy concoction. While it looked homemade it could easily have been Sysco or some other supplier brand. Either way it was delicious, and complimented the fish perfectly. Since I half expected it to be a packet of Hellmanns mayo or Kraft tartar sauce, whatever it was, was very welcome. On the side I got two standard looking rolls but, to my dismay, no coleslaw. I wonder if this was just an oversight or if they really stiff you on the slaw every time? Regardless, a one for one trade is certainly in order and when I go back again I will certainly ask.Overall, I was very impressed with my first gas station Fish Fry. The fish was good and well above my expectations as were the fries and the tartar. Were any of them the best out there? Certainly not. Collectively, were they all above average and a fantastic value? You bet your ass. I really cant imagine how you could get a better deal than this. True, you dont get huge portions for $3.29 and they dont have the overhead of a sit down restaurant but that price seems like barely enough cut a profit. Im sure I will be back soon, next time I will order a 5 piece and do what the locals seemed to smart enough to do, call 5 minutes ahead.www.kwiktrip.com1301 North Main StreetViroqua, WI 54665     (608) 637-2114",3500,0.21457750260075845,0.5014719453672942

Coopers is a Food Fight place so you know everything is going to be well thought out, but a little sterile at the same time. Since its owned by a restaurant group and not an individual family things are a little more hands-off and managed rather than loved. That said, all the establishments are well coordinated and have been wildly successful so its hard to hold it against them. They are clearly doing something right.Since its not family-owned and operated the idea of a Friday special goes right out the window and the best thing you can hope for in terms a Fish Fry is the $14 for Fish-n-Chips on the regular menu. The management at Coopers knows what they are doing and A) have a very impressive beer selection, and B) make sure the food comes quickly, and ours certainly did. The fish in this case is haddock which is encased in a very thick batter. Despite the abundant coating (which we usually loathe) the fish was still really tasty. The batter had lots of flavor which surprisingly complemented the smooth haddock rather than overwhelming it. An unexpected balance was struck and even though we wouldnt go out of our way for this fish, wed definitely get it again. Like the fish, the skin-on, Julienne-cut fries were also good, but not great. The portion was adequate and the spuds were well fried so theres nothing to complain about, but not a lot to rave about either. We have come to expect consistency from the Food Fight folks which usually means there wont be any surprises. When it comes to Fish Fry anything out of the ordinary is often unwelcome, but in the case of Coopers tartar we were surprised in the best of ways. The shot glass of anchovy infused sauce was incredibly zesty and flavorful, and really put the haddock in its place despite the bountiful better. There were clearly some mustard seeds in it which really perked things up and helped the creamy concoction last until the very end. Well played, management. A little bit of house-made slaw came along for the ride, and like the tartar carried a surprise, but unlike the tartar this wasnt a welcomed one. It was an incredibly sweet vinegar-based slaw that had a pear essence that we could have done without. Since this was a Fish-n-Chips affair no bread was expected and sure enough none came. While Fish Fry isnt unique to family-run operations it certainly seems to thrive at them. Weve had fish at several Food Fight restaurants including: Coopers, Craftsman, Montys, and Hubbard Avenue, to name a few, and not one has bowled us over even though all have been decent. There just seems to be a slight disconnect between making good food, and something uniquely special. Overall, we recommend the Fish-n-Chips at Coopers Tavern, but think there are plenty of better places to get your Fish Fry fix. www.thecooperstavern.com/20 West Mifflin StreetMadison, WI           (608) 256-1600",2960,0.2408082706766917,0.518601685838528

One, the Fish Fry at St. Peters Catholic School is one of the absolute best around; two, free Badger hockey tickets are hard to pass up; and three, Fish Frys at St. Petes and Badger home games seem to coincide an awful lot. A couple Fridays back we had planned to attend the divine Fish Fry, but as fate would have it, a free pair of tickets to the Wisconsin-North Dakota game fell into our laps. Since we figured dining in Ashton and making it back into town to watch the puck drop would be a bit of a time crunch, we decided to just grab some grub downtown before the game. We chose The Coopers Tavern on a whim, or so it seemed. Jer was at the Underground Kitchen attending a birthday get-together, and since the gastropub is right down the street, it just made sense. We arrived a little before 6:00 and were immediately seated in the cozy confines of Coopers. The waitress came around eventually and grabbed our orders for two Fish Frys specials and a couple beers. We talked hockey for a bit, and 15 minutes or so later the food arrived. Wasting no time we both broke into our bounty the second it made contact with the table. The cod looked idyllic as the three golden beer battered pieces shone brightly despite the dim lighting that graces Coopers. Looks can be deceiving and the first bite told a bit of a different story. While the batter looked flawless, the thin coating lacked any distinctive flavor, and did little to help the pedestrian cod underneath. The fish itself was actually quite flaky, but like the batter it lacked substance and finished with an almost watery taste. By and large it was acceptable, but very average.Thankfully, the common cod keeps good company and the friendly French fries and trustworthy tartar urged him along. Coopers fries are clearly homemade and even though a couple were slightly undercooked, they bulk of them were simply excellent. Likewise, the tartar was clearly made in house, and the thin, mayo-rich blend did what it could to pull the cod from obscurity. The only drawbacks were the tiny bit of dill present, and the miniature pitcher the sauce was served in which made dunking difficult, and was just kind of cheesy in general. Coopers has definitely done some things right, but when it comes to coleslaw and bread they seem to have missed the mark. Like the fries and tartar, the slaw is clearly homemade, but for whatever reason they have chosen to load it up with peppers and sweet vinegar. While I could take it or leave it, Jer was straight up put off by the tangy concoction and had no problem letting me know about it. I was more put off by the lack of bread accompanying the $13 meal, especially since I know they have some good stuff back in that kitchen (Ive had the Reuben, and it features a fine bread). There is really a lot to like about Coopers, and we appreciated the speedy (but somewhat lackadaisical) service which helped us make it to the Kohl Center with time to spare. The Badgers would go on to lose the game 1-0 in overtime, and while they didnt get blown off the ice, they didnt take advantage of anything that was given to them. I was disappointed in their performance, and kind of felt the same way about this Fish Fry. Coopers is obviously doing some really great things, but this time they didnt bury the biscuit when they had the chance. Kicking the cod into high gear, and throwing a shot of bread on net would at least make them a force to be reckoned with, but as it stands their game is currently lacking. Overall, I still think this Fish Fry is recommendable, but like the Badger hockey team, it probably isnt gonna win a championship this year. These squads both have a solid foundation to build on and with some refinement and more experience they may be in line for a shot at the title one day, but as of now well call them works in progress. www.thecooperstavern.com/20 West Mifflin StreetMadison, WI           (608) 256-1600",3973,0.09524989274989275,0.47478978978978975

Their awful music permeated the tiniest cracks of our culture resulting in packs of underage girls (and their mothers) fawning over teenager-ish boys. This trend hasnt exactly changed and new groups of New Kids seem to turn up almost daily to reproduce audio garbage similar to their predecessors. Thankfully for us Fish Fry eaters, we can easily avoid horrible groups like these and focus our efforts on places like The Coopers Tavern which is Madisons very own new kid on the block.The Coopers Tavern recently opened to much acclaim and since I have been waiting for a Food Fight place that offers Fish Fry I jumped at the opportunity to give it a try on the first available Friday. We arrived at the West Mifflin establishment around 6:30 and put our name on the list. The place was packed, so his 30 minute estimate seemed short sighted, but we rolled with it and grabbed a couple drinks at the jam-packed bar. After only about 20 minutes he found us on the other side of the snug and showed us to our table, complete with a spectacular view of the capitol building.The waitress wormed her way through the crowd and was at our table a couple minutes after we were seated. While it was not listed on the menu (or anywhere in the gastropub) The Coopers Tavern was offering a 2-piece cod Fish Fry for $12.95. Three of the four at our table went for this special while our lone vegetarian obviously did not. The cod came about 15 minutes or so after the order went in and was hot, but not scalding when served. It tasted good and was cloaked in a beer batter which was just fine. This batter was dark in color and wasnt as light in texture as I normally like, but I wouldnt say it was thick and heavy either.  The fish itself was good and seemed to be high quality. The cod fillets were not really flaky but were not mushy or greasy either. In the end, the cod was similar to that of the Old Fashioned, not great, but certainly not bad, although another piece for that price would certainly be reasonable.Like a lot of classy places in this day and age they cant simply call a French fry a French fry. The frites are served in a cone shaped piece of paper in a pint glass. I cant really figure out the point of serving fries in this method and hope it is more about space saving rather than grease filtering. Regardless these frites fell slightly below my expectations. They were heavily salted, but not super hot. The result was some limp salty potato strings which still tasted good but were not excellent. In comparison, I had an order or frites at Jacs the night before which were head and shoulders above these babies. Jacs frites were pushing a perfect 10, these were maybe a 7. Before the fish came we treated ourselves to their pretzel appetizer with beer cheese sauce. The homemade pretzels themselves were good, but the beer cheese was out of this world. I almost picked up the little cup and drank the remainder once all the pretzels were gone, it was just that tasty. This leads me to believe they have a kick ass sous-chef since the tartar sauce was also just fantastic. It was sweet and smooth and improved the taste of the fish ten fold. I buried my portion even with a mere two pieces of fish.It also turned out that no bread is served with the thirteen dollar Fish Fry so these preemptive pretzels were a great idea. However, since they are not part of the Fish Fry I cant give them any points for them. I will give them some credit for the mountain of slaw that my fish seemed to be climbing when served. This slaw was made in house with lots of green pepper. While it was clean it was not super tasty. This is the kind of fancy slaw I would expect at a Food Fight establishment and while it was kind of a raw tasting I still ate most of it.After our first visit to The Coopers Tavern I can say that we will definitely be back, although maybe not for the Fish Fry right away. The fish and fries were good but the tartar and beer cheese were the stars of the show. The service was quick even though it was pretty damn busy and the host did a good job of keeping things moving. Overall, this Fish Fry is recommendable and could easily move into the highly recommended strata with some good bread and another piece of fish. As it stands The Coopers Tavern has a tiny bit of work to do to get their Fish Fry up to snuff with the rest of the Food Fight reputation, but I do give them a lot of credit since it was their first week in business.www.thecooperstavern.com/20 West Mifflin StreetMadison, WI           (608) 256-1600",4658,0.15641457120115657,0.5046191207166818

It's not even five minutes outside of the city limits, but the intersection of Buckeye and Femrite feels like a world away. We'd been there once before and were pleasantly surprised at the ambiance (there's definitely a country music vibe) and the service (CCs is a bar first and restaurant second) so we figured we'd come back sometimes soon thereafter. Well, it took almost a decade but we finally followed up and mostly did so mostly because we saw they now have bluegill on their lunch menu (and I just can't resist cheap bluegill).The sunfish in the country is dirt cheap (at least as far as bluegill goes) with the ""#3"" going for a mere $13. For being out of town it was busy during lunchtime, but our waitress was super fast and super nice - she even let us do a 1-piece cod with a half order of French fries and charged accordingly for our 4 year old. All told our fish fried in about five minutes and hit the table in a cloud of dust and plume of steam. Seven fillets made up the portion and were mostly on the large side but there was a minnow or two in there. The small ones were VERY fishy and would turn a lot of people off, but the balance were smooth and mild. They had a snappy, not rubbery, texture and NO GREASE at all. They were enrobed with a panko-style breading that was intriguingly crispy and didn't dry out the fillets in the least. By and large, it was surprisingly well done, but a little more seasoning in the breading would go a long way. County Corners is a pretty basic bar and some pretty basic fries are produced by their fryer. If nothing else they were soaked for just the right amount of time and came out crispy without being overdone. A thin and dilly tartar didn't do the fish any favors with its lack of zip and it's lack of stick. While tartar is an afterthought for some, for us a thicker, bolder sauce really drives things home and this dilly dangler did anything but. It was the only real detractor save for the lack of bread served. Rounding out the meal was a creamy slaw with a potent horseradish finish that, while not enough to make your eyes water, did open up the sinuses a bit. We're suckers for the radical root so this kind of slaw sits just fine with us, but it might be a little to pungent for some lily livered polecats. While Country Corners might not be what most people envision when they think of bars in and around Madison it's actually a pretty nice place with pretty good food. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and think it's a definitely worth a drive into the country. www.triciascountrycorners.com/3737 County Road ABMcFarland, WI 53558     (608) 222-2077",2709,0.16084869431643625,0.5189708141321043

Dont get me wrong, I love me some Waylon Jennings, but when faced with the prospect of Fish Fry at one of the Madison areas few country and western style bars, I was not sure what to expect. Since Tircas Country Corners recently started offering a lunch hour Fish Fry, and I feel the need to try any and every Fish Fry around, I knew what I had to do. I saddled up my trusty steed and hit the trail. I was in for a whale of a Fish Fry come 5 oclock so I wanted to keep my midday intake of fish to a minimum, luckily for me County Corners was on the same page. My one man wagon train pulled into the station around 11:30 and I moseyed into the saloon. I grabbed an open stool at the bar as the friendly barkeep grabbed me a mug of Spotted Cow. When he came back I put in my order for the $6.25, 2-piece cod special and took a gander around the place.After about 10 minutes my fish arrived fresh from the fryer, just the way I like it. I wrangled up one of the two pieces and had at it. The first taste was good as I immediately noticed the flaky batter. It had a nice flavor and was fairly flaky, but necessarily light. It was a little thicker than I expected which made it heavier than it looked like it should be. Regardless, the batter was still tasty as was the actual cod, even though it (the cod) was not flaky. I suspect it was fried slightly too long which wasnt really too big of a deal since the overall taste was still good.The French fries were also good. They were pretty standard looking but were perfectly fried with the crispy outside giving way to soft, decedent centers. They worked well with the fish and ran in a large herd like the once mighty buffalo. A portion of this size is enough to fill even the hungriest of cowboys. The tartar was also more than plentiful, and while it was nice and thick, it was seriously heavy on the relish. I gotta say though, it did grow on me and I polished off the whole lot when all was said and done.They compliment their seriously relish-y tartar with a seriously horseradish-y slaw. I dont think it is any secret that country boys like a little horseradish now and again. Country Corners clearly knows this and has no problem lacing their slaw with above average amounts of the potent substance. Even so, the slaw was actually quite good and I buried the entire cup. Since this lunch Fry came in basket form there was no bread to speak of which is always a bit of a downer. I like the balance that bread affords a Fish Fry but it isnt necessarily a deal breaker.I really wasnt sure what to expect from Country Corners before this trip. They bill it as a country bar but it really isnt that extreme. In fact, Im pretty sure I did not hear one country song even though music was playing the entire time. It turns out this is a nice little Fish Fry a moreover it is simply and nice bar. The place was plenty busy and very few people were actually eating Fish Fry, so you know the everyday food is good too. Overall, I have no qualms about recommending this Fish Fry. The fish, fries, tartar, and slaw were all good and the service spot on. I arrived at 11:30 and was done by noon, like Jesse James robbing a train I was in and out in no time flat. Instead of stolen loot, my prize was a full belly and story to tell of delicious country fried fish. If you are a Fish Fry fan, Tricas Country Corners is worth a shot.www.triciascountrycorners.com/3737 County Road ABMcFarland, WI 53558     (608) 222-2077",3556,0.14323538276069922,0.47715792646172395

From the best dog groomers, to which bars have the most expansive beer selections, social media sites can help you uncover great new places that you may not have been able to find otherwise. Unfortunately, they also can have the reverse effect when biased or non-credible sources decide to put in their two cents. With the ubiquitous anonymity of the web how is one to know a reputable source from a non-reputable one? It really can be a tough call. Luckily, when youre in Madison and youre talking about fish theres Madison Fish Fry.Our first visit to The Vintage Brewing Company was a total failure partially because they were sorta new, and partially because we had a long wait, but mostly because they only had fish-n-chips (not a real Fish Fry). Well, we recently learned that as theyve developed, theyve added a full-fledged Friday Fish special, and it is arguably one of the best in the city. Wed also heard that it was All You Can Eat which instantly made our old review obsolete and in need of replacement. The wait this time around was short and our party of seven got a big table (3 small tables squished together) in the main dining room without much dely. As soon as we all sat down our waiter came over, chitchatted for a sec, then sped off to get us another round of drinks. When he came back with the booze food orders were taken and the game was afoot. The Friday Night Fish at the Vintage is cod and comes in three different sizes - small - $13.99, medium - $15.99, and large - $17.99. The small starts it off at three pieces with each subsequent jump receiving one additional six ounces piece *waiter does hand gesture to indicate the enormity of the pieces*. Most everyone went for the standard 3-piece since $14 is already pretty pricey and going above that is just kinda crazy  at least for cod. The food came in due time and was nice and hot, well give them that. The pieces of fish were similar to the waiters gesture although were longer and skinnier than I would have expected (one piece was roughly the equivalent of two pieces at Wilsons stacked end to end). The fish was actually pretty good, and quite a bit better than we recalled it being. It had a light breading, and was devoid of grease, but was a tad over-fried on the ends since the long fillets tapered off. It was nothing if not a unique cut since cod is usually served in much smaller or much larger pieces. Overall, it was good, and better than we remembered.Like the cod, the steak fries were respectable, but plagued by minor imperfections. In this case, their numbers were small and there were a lot of nubbins (must have got the bottom of the basket). Even with the oddballs, the thick-cut spuds were acceptable, as were the gen-u-ine Tater Tots. The Ore-Ida originals were perfectly cooked, displaying yet again, that deep-frying is the way to go when youre talkin taters. I mean, weve all made Tots at home, but they never come out quite like this  crispy, golden, plush  just the way the parent corporation intended. A relatively scant amount of what appeared to be homemade tartar sauce joined the party and while it was good, only one cup came for the three big pieces of fish. I immediately requested backup, as I knew that the tiny allotment wouldnt stand up to a three-piece of this size. The sauce was thick and creamy, and enhanced the fish in the necessary ways - not many complaints here. There were some grumblings over the coleslaw however...  What was claimed to be spicy slaw was basically a raw tasting mix of incongruous chunks of plain ol dry cabbage in a tiny bit of vinegar, doused with chili powder. The mix was off-putting, to say the least, and you couldnt even cleanse your palate of it with bread since none was provided. While this visit was a step up from our previous trip, Im still not sure we can recommend this Fish Fry. It is just a bit too expensive for what you get even, and though the fish, fries, and tartar were all good the lack of bread hurt and the un-edible slaw took away just enough to make the meal unworthy of the $14 price tag. It was just not a knock-your-socks-off affair and while Im sure there are some people who dont mind paying a little extra for the atmosphere and flair of The Vintage, its just not enough to make this the Fish Fry for me. Arguably the best? Yeah, think I can argue that www.vintagebrewingco.com/674 South Whitney WayMadison, WI 53711     (608) 204-2739",4488,0.09857397092245578,0.4839084736812008

I am not a huge fan of vintage clothing, unless of course, it came from my old mans closest. The main reason for my reluctance is the fact that you just dont know where clothes from a secondhand shop have been. However, not all things in life that are vintage are actually old. A new kind of vintage has opened in the well known space that was once occupied by JT Whitneys. The Vintage Brewing Company isnt interested in argyle socks or cardigan sweaters, their focus falls squarely on filling bellies, although Im not sure they do it all that well. We were meeting some friends and planned to eat around eight, but since some of us didnt have much else going on we decided to rendezvous a little early and have some drinks beforehand. As we waited for everyone to show up we tried some appetizers and looked over the menu. The cheese curds looked like they came from the A&W and were very Sysco-blah, as was the guacamole in the chips and guac platter. In addition to the lackluster apps, the closest the Vintage gets to Friday Night Fish Fry is the $8.25 fish-n-chips which is served every day. Needless to say, the Vintage did not start this Friday on a positive note.Eventually everyone in our party of seven arrived and our friendly young waiter came to take our orders. We had a fairly mixed bag of tastes this evening and he did a good job taking care each one individually. He scurried away to put in the order and bring us some more drinks. The fish-n-chips came about 15 minutes or so after the order went in and was hot, but not scalding, when served.For your $8.25 you get three tiny pieces of cod. The petite fillets were cloaked in a fairly heavy beer batter which was overall lacking in flavor. The cod itself was actually fairly tasty, but my three little guys got greasy quickly which led to my last piece being a little spongy. In general, it was not that great and the portion size was incredibly small, certainly not enough for a big appetite. Like the cod, the French fries did not arrive in the quantity I had hoped for. The Julienne cut fries tasted slightly better than the fish, although the skin-on potatoes were slightly undercooked. The tartar was also underwhelming, and barely even qualifies as tartar in my book. It was very thin and was more like ranch dressing than a creamy tartar. The smooth concoction tasted good, but is not a classic tartar, and really didnt improve the fish at all.Being that this isnt a real Fish Fry, there was no bread served which left me feeling incomplete. Neither the zesty, vinegar laden slaw, nor the laidback, low pressure service we received was not enough to make up for it.Overall I dont think this fish is recommendable. The small portion, average food quality, and lack of bread are just too glaring of shortcomings. It is really too bad because they have done a great job revamping the atmosphere and making the place aesthetically pleasing. Unfortunately, like a pair of vintage pants, the fish-n-chips at The Vintage Brewing Company kind of stinks. However in this case, the small portion size and lackluster sides are the culprits, not mothballs.www.vintagebrewingco.com/674 South Whitney WayMadison, WI 53711     (608) 204-2739",3276,0.08260227272727273,0.4664814814814815
http://madisonfishfry.com/reviews.php?restaurant=259,http://madisonfishfry.com/reviews.php?restaurant=259&event=461,2010-02-19,Bennett's Meadowood County Club,"Overall, I would barely recommend this Fish Fry.",Good,Good,Good,Poor,Good,"We got into the Fish Fry reviewing game innocently enough about six years ago. Back then there was very little available in the way of reliable Fish Fry information. We got the idea to start capturing as much info as we could since we were eating these Fish Frys anyway. Eventually we figured we should put it on the web since we assumed there were probably a lot of other folks in similar situations to which we once were, hungry for Fish Fry, but not sure where to go. We put in our time and sampled over 100 individual places before we felt comfortable that we knew what we were doing. By this point it was 2006 and another local Fish Fry lover bought a  similar domain and had started her own reviews. Soon enough the  Wisconsin Fish Fry Reviews blog showed up and the information base grew even more. Today there are well over a  half dozen  sites/blogs dedicated to reviewing Fish Frys in their local regions often times with varying opinions about the same Fish Fry.  It turns out that if you really scour the net you will eventually happen upon  Cool Dadio and his Fish Fry review page. I like Cool Dadio for a few reasons. One, he has a different part of the state on lockdown and if I ever go SW for a Fish Fry his page will prove a valuable resource. Two, he has been at this for a while and has a good catalog built up which lends him some credibility. Lastly, and maybe most importantly, the dude reviews Fish Fry and strip clubs. He is not gonna be tied to one specialty area. He is clearly a renaissance man who has his priorities straight and knows what needs to be done. Cool Dadio is cool with Madison Fish Fry.Recently Cool Dadio visited Bennetts Meadowood Country Club on Madisons southwest side and had some favorable words for their walleye special. Since I was looking for a new lunch-time Fish Fry and Bennetts plays that game, I told Gabe to meet me there. I showed up around 12:45 and grabbed a spot at the bar. Unbeknownst to me, Gabe arrived earlier than his 1pm estimate and was waiting there for me. We both sat separately at the bar for a good 20-30 minutes before I finally looked around the large gentleman to my left to see him sitting there enjoying a book and a beer. As soon as he saw me he moved over and we hailed one of the bartender/waitress types to order some fish.With the $7.25 lunch special came the choice of soup or salad bar of which we both chose the salad bar. This salad bar was like none other I have seen. It was six tubs in a tray full of ice perched atop the highest part of the bar. It was mildly amusing to see Gabe standing on his tiptoes to see what the tubs contained. Each was filled with a different kind of salad and these were real salads my friends, no lettuce here. One housed the cottage cheese and one the snotty looking, but tasty coleslaw. The remaining four were home to: tuna salad with noodles, Cajun chicken salad, potato salad and one other salad that I didnt try. Those I did try were all pretty tasty even though they looked like they could have been store bought.We finished our salads and the walleye came about 5 minutes or so later, direct from the fryer. The single fillet was piled onto a generous stack of fries and tartar. It was a bit of a conundrum since you would really like to be able to cut the walleye up, but there was no real estate to do so. I wound up ripping mine in half lengthwise to facilitate its handling and cooling. The walleye had a firm, yet very flavorful batter. It was certainly a unique blend of spices with a clear hint of cinnamon. While the batter tasted good the texture was not really great and was a little too thick and firm overall. The fish itself was rather thin and fairly small for a walleye fillet. It was mildly flaky but also a little firm in spots. In particular, the ends were ultra crispy and really had to be ripped apart.The straight cut fries were standard pub fare, but were cooked and salted well. The tartar was also good as it had some mustard intermingling with a butt load of relish. It was nice and thick, and at the least it gave the spicy walleye and zesty kick. We all know Bennetts as the ingenious purveyors Smut and Eggs on weekends. While this wasnt the Smut and Fish Fry I was thinking it might be it still wasnt bad. Even though the service leaves a little something to be desired, and there was no bread with the Fish Fry, I would still recommend it, but just barely. Overall, it is a good deal since you are getting walleye for $7.25 with an AYCE style salad bar. If there is one thing I have found about Cool Dadio it is that everything is cool with him, including Bennetts. If there are places that he wouldnt recommend he must not list them because I have yet to read one truly negative review. Here at Madison Fish Fry if the Fish Fry stinks we will let you know about it. As it stands, Bennetts doesn't stink but there is definitely and odor present. They get passing marks from us, but with a B-/C+ average we probably wont be chomping at the bit to return.www.menupix.com/menudirectory/menu.php?id=7300632009 Freeport RoadMadison, WI 53711     (608) 271-3827",5132,0.0850919913419913,0.4795960339774772

While those two adjectives dont necessarily connote great food, they adequately describe what you expect to get from most interstate-adjacent eateries. These highway hotspots need to have food that pleases the masses while at the same time getting them back on the road in a jiffy. This is usually accomplished through heavily-processed, frozen grub that gets thrown in a fryer and slapped together with little care for the consumer and no concern for quality (McDonalds anyone?). Its a bit of a sad commentary on what is acceptable in this day and age, and really displays some of the poor choices made by our drive thru society. Thank goodness there are places like the Rodeside Grill.The Rodeside is up in Windsor, and if youve ever taken a trip up I-90/94 youve probably driven past it without even realizing it was there. Due to its prime location its an oasis for travelers, but unlike fast food places, it also seems to do a good job of bringing in the locals. Its actually a pretty nice place, with a great log-cabin feel, a playroom for the kids, and a big old bar for the adults. Whats more, the Rodeside isnt just some chain restaurant with pre-packaged food, and a generic atmosphere; its a real place for real people complete with a real Wisconsin Fish Fry. The bulk of the Rodeside Fish Fry is served after 4pm, but they do have a bluegill basket available all day every day, and this Friday featured a 2-piece cod plate. As you might expect, my fish arrived in no time and was steaming hot (the Rodeside has the FAST part down). The cod wasnt amazing, but definitely looked the part. It had a golden beer batter which wasnt thick, but wasnt super thin either. While the batter could have used some more seasoning it was still decent, and added just enough to the flaky fish. While the cod wasnt superb, it was still good, and definitely inoffensive. Since the cod played it safe it needed a good swift kick and thats just what the tartar delivered. The sassy sauce was thick and creamy, and had the zip the fish lacked. It really worked the cod over, and made it more desirable. Fries are the norm at most interstate stops, but the Rodeside has better options since they have a real kitchen. The hash browns were clearly done in-house and featured a boatload of gooey cheddar and heaps of fried onion. They were simply superb, but lost a few points on our scale since the portion was on the small side. Unfortunately, there is no coleslaw or bread served with the $8 lunch special, which casts an unpleasant light on what was otherwise a fine little Fish Fry. Inoffensive and fast. While the food at the Rodeside fits that mold to some extent its a far cry from your average interstate drive thru crap. Everything is made to order, served with a smile, and doesnt come wrapped or boxed. Overall, we recommend the barebones Fish Fry at the Rodeside Grill, and would welcome more places like it along Americas highways. www.rodesidegrill.com6317 Rostad DriveWindsor, WI 53598     (608) 846-1874",3047,0.18045778697952605,0.5298596733379343

That to secure this deliciousness, expert fry cooks are instituted among men, deriving their genius from years in the kitchen and countless hours of frying.

To prove this we will eat every Fish Fry, and let facts be submitted to a candid world.Madison Fish Fry is declaring its independence from any and all tyrants who would say that bars cannot be held up amongst the best in the Fish Fry universe, for we have been to Cahoots. Cahoots is a very unassuming looking bar, but packs a wallop when Friday night rolls around. We stumbled into Cahoots right around 8 oclock, grabbed a pint of the Cow at the bar, and found ourselves a table right near the door. Having noticed that we were in the mood for more than just booze, the petite waitress pranced over and took our order almost immediately. Since MFF has patronized the establishment previously we knew that the cock of the walk was the lake perch, and had no trouble convincing Melissa that she should follow her Fish Fry friend in ordering. Jer, being the delightful character that he is, changed it up a bit and chose to canoodle with some cod. We also procured an appetizer of mini corn dogs cause the lady of the table was just in that kind of mood.The little cornies came well before the fish and were not great, but certainly tasted just like a corn dog. When the fish hit the table a few minutes later they were quickly put into the back of our minds as the pristine perch stole the show instantly. Wasting no time (as per usual) I grabbed one of the six fillets and went to town. Just like Dexters earlier in the day I was immediately greeted by excellence. The perch enjoyed a flavorful, crumbly batter which complimented the moist, flaky fish underneath perfectly. This is easily some of the best perch around town and one of the few places that gives the Villa Tap a run for their money. In no time flat I exhausted my portion and moved on the help my friends with theirs.Jer, being the generous soul that he is, also allowed me a bite or two of his cod which was also good, but not in the same echelon as its freshwater counterpart. While it dawned the same breading as the perch, it was much richer and tasted like it had be drown in butter prior to meeting its maker in the fryer. Overall, it was still very good, but the perch was clearly superior.  Being that we are a diverse group of individuals we chose diverse potato options, which seems fitting. The best among them were the good old French fries which were straight-cut and delicious. They resembled McDonalds fries and were every bit as good, if not better. The twice baked potato that Jer paired with his cod turned out to be not so hot, while the baked potato was, well, a baked potato. All reports were that the fries were easily the best among them, which reinforced what I already knew in my heart to be true. Fries people, fries.As you may know, Madison Fish Fry likes tartar with his fish, but when the percentage of dill present rises, this is not the case. Cahoots hasnt fully fallen victim to the dill-craze, but they do slip a fair amount into their sauce. While it still tastes pretty good, the dill/relish ratio is close to pushing it over the edge. That said, at this point it still helps the fish, but the perch is so good, and so flavorful on its own, the assistance was minimal.Putting the finishing touches on this Fish Fry were some zesty coleslaw and a wee dinner roll. The slaw was actually pretty good, but the roll was a little below average and Jer and Melissa didnt even give it a chance. I found them both to be edible and perfectly complimentary to the spectacular fish.Being that Cahoots has kind of an odd layout it is pretty remarkable just how good of a job they do feeding the flock. The young waitress was quick and attentive, while the owner/manager dude went around to just about every table to check on the satisfaction of his guests. Overall, this is one spectacular little Fish Fry and a pretty good value at 11 bucks. It is easily recommendable and well even go beyond that to say the perch is no doubt, some of the best in the city. The French fries were also great and when amalgamated with a suitable tartar, some creamy slaw and a plain old roll were just what the doctor ordered. Christ Cahoots, where did you even come from? I guess I dont really care as long as you stick around and keep that perch a-comin. Score another one for the Fish Fry guy, and yall make sure to put Cahoots on your Friday night wish list.www.cahootsbar.net102 West Railroad StreetVerona, WI 53593     (608) 497-1230",5031,0.31256627393225334,0.5252683685157911

To prove this we will eat every Fish Fry, and let facts be submitted to a candid world.Madison Fish Fry is declaring its independence from any and all tyrants who would say that bars cannot be held up amongst the best in the Fish Fry universe, for we have been to Cahoots. Cahoots is a very unassuming looking bar, but packs a wallop when Friday night rolls around. We stumbled into Cahoots right around 8 oclock, grabbed a pint of the Cow at the bar, and found ourselves a table right near the door. Having noticed that we were in the mood for more than just booze, the petite waitress pranced over and took our order almost immediately. Since MFF has patronized the establishment previously we knew that the cock of the walk was the lake perch, and had no trouble convincing Melissa that she should follow her Fish Fry friend in ordering. Jer, being the delightful character that he is, changed it up a bit and chose to canoodle with some cod. We also procured an appetizer of mini corn dogs cause the lady of the table was just in that kind of mood.The little cornies came well before the fish and were not great, but certainly tasted just like a corn dog. When the fish hit the table a few minutes later they were quickly put into the back of our minds as the pristine perch stole the show instantly. Wasting no time (as per usual) I grabbed one of the six fillets and went to town. Just like Dexters earlier in the day I was immediately greeted by excellence. The perch enjoyed a flavorful, crumbly batter which complimented the moist, flaky fish underneath perfectly. This is easily some of the best perch around town and one of the few places that gives the Villa Tap a run for their money. In no time flat I exhausted my portion and moved on the help my friends with theirs.Jer, being the generous soul that he is, also allowed me a bite or two of his cod which was also good, but not in the same echelon as its freshwater counterpart. While it dawned the same breading as the perch, it was much richer and tasted like it had be drown in butter prior to meeting its maker in the fryer. Overall, it was still very good, but the perch was clearly superior.  Being that we are a diverse group of individuals we chose diverse potato options, which seems fitting. The best among them were the good old French fries which were straight-cut and delicious. They resembled McDonalds fries and were every bit as good, if not better. The twice baked potato that Jer paired with his cod turned out to be not so hot, while the baked potato was, well, a baked potato. All reports were that the fries were easily the best among them, which reinforced what I already knew in my heart to be true. Fries people, fries.As you may know, Madison Fish Fry likes tartar with his fish, but when the percentage of dill present rises, this is not the case. Cahoots hasnt fully fallen victim to the dill-craze, but they do slip a fair amount into their sauce. While it still tastes pretty good, the dill/relish ratio is close to pushing it over the edge. That said, at this point it still helps the fish, but the perch is so good, and so flavorful on its own, the assistance was minimal.Putting the finishing touches on this Fish Fry were some zesty coleslaw and a wee dinner roll. The slaw was actually pretty good, but the roll was a little below average and Jer and Melissa didnt even give it a chance. I found them both to be edible and perfectly complimentary to the spectacular fish.Being that Cahoots has kind of an odd layout it is pretty remarkable just how good of a job they do feeding the flock. The young waitress was quick and attentive, while the owner/manager dude went around to just about every table to check on the satisfaction of his guests. Overall, this is one spectacular little Fish Fry and a pretty good value at 11 bucks. It is easily recommendable and well even go beyond that to say the perch is no doubt, some of the best in the city. The French fries were also great and when amalgamated with a suitable tartar, some creamy slaw and a plain old roll were just what the doctor ordered. Christ Cahoots, where did you even come from? I guess I dont really care as long as you stick around and keep that perch a-comin. Score another one for the Fish Fry guy, and yall make sure to put Cahoots on your Friday night wish list.www.cahootsbar.net102 West Railroad StreetVerona, WI 53593     (608) 497-1230",5031,0.31256627393225334,0.5252683685157911

Not only do you have the week-in week-out Fish Fry crowds, but the Catholics seem to come out of the woodwork.

Thankfully there are plenty of other Fish Fry options available as long as you go off the beaten path and are willing to try something new. After a botched attempt at Cahoots in Verona on New Years Day I figured their relatively unknown Fish Fry would be a good bet on this, the busiest of the busy Fridays. I rolled into Cahoots just before 8 oclock and saw not one, but two friendly faces. I had fully expected to see good ol Gabe, but was surprised to see our hometown friend Jen Mac, who just so happened to be bartending and waitressing. She came right over, grabbed me a Spotted Cow, recommended the lake perch, and then scurried off to take care of the rest of the diners. When she came back to take our orders it was a simple matter of me following her recommendation and Gabe putting in for his standard cod. We sucked down our beers, BSed with Jen a little bit when she came by, and within 10 minutes our fish was ready.The perch and cod were both fresh from the fryer and placed in front of us in pristine condition. The six grandiose perch fillets were flanked by a platoon of fries, a generous cup of slaw, some homemade tartar sauce and a standard looking white roll. The fish was simply too hot too handle, so I spread out my bounty and probed the slaw first. To my surprise the diverse looking slaw was delicious. It was a superb blend, a little creamy but still zesty. After a couple bites I felt the fish had cooled enough and refocused my attention on it, although I did polish off all the slaw eventually. At first taste it was clear, the perch is fantastic. It has a spicy, ultra flavorful batter that is similar to that of the Villa Tap or the Old Fashioned. It was light, fall apart flaky, and complimented the thick perch fillets well. Since the perch was more than plentiful I swapped one with Gabe so I could try the cod as well. The cod was rich and buttery with a light batter that rivaled that of the perch. While I would say the perch was slightly better, the tender, flaky cod was well above average. Both styles of fish were delicious solo, but were improved by the untraditional, but very tasty tartar. It was clearly homemade and had a unique blend of ingredients including some dill, which I usually hate. Even so, it was very good, although not incredibly thick.The matchstick style fries were hot and crisp and complimented the limp perch very well. There were also an absolute ton of them. When you take this portion size into account along with the above average amount of fish, the eleven dollar price tag seems more than fair. Up until this point Cahoots Fish Fry was practically flawless and I was reveling in my decision to try them over the big guys. The stale and tasteless white roll brought me back to earth a little bit, but was nowhere near enough to bring me off my Fish Fry high. Overall, I am going to highly recommend the Fish Fry at Cahoots. They definitely know what they are doing and are producing some top notch fish. Some local folks have clearly caught on to this fact since Jen said they were busy as hell earlier in the night, and had just cleared out a little before our ugly mugs showed up. As it stands, we were able to sit at the bar and enjoy our fish in peace and quiet, which is nothing short of remarkable on the first Friday of Lent. There was no standing uncomfortably shoulder-to-shoulder with a bunch of randoms for us. No hollering drink orders to a bartender while leaning over someone who was lucky enough to actually get a stool. We beat the crowd. Whats more, we still got a great Fish Fry which is all you can ask for any Friday, more or less the busiest one of the year. To use the old adage, we are in cahoots with Cahoots now.

http://madisonfishfry.com/reviews.php?restaurant=261,http://madisonfishfry.com/reviews.php?restaurant=261&event=468,2010-03-05,Sprecher's Restaurant and Pub - CLOSED,"Overall, I would not recommend this Fish Fry.",Fair,Good,Good,Poor,Good,"Life is all about enjoying the simple pleasures. Little things, like, listening to your favorite album, or slapping some brats on the grill are tiny moments that should be savored even if they seem like everyday activities. One of my personal favorite simple pleasures is enjoying a delicious 16oz. Sprechers Root Beer, easily the greatest bottled root beer available today. Sprechers is brewed in Milwaukee, but recently sold their name to a company who has opened a new Restaurant and Pub on Madisons west side, complete with a full selection of tap beer and root beer. Since the draught root beer at our hometown A&W was about 1000 times better than A&W in a can, I shuddered to think how euphoric the taste experience of a draught Sprechers Root Beer would be and knew I needed to try it immediately.While perusing Sprechers website I noticed that in addition to the draught beer they were listing a Friday Fish Fry special. The evening was setting up perfectly, draught root beer, Fish Fry, and multiple vegetarian options; all this at a new restaurant with nothing but positive reviews across the web. We made our plans, and when we arrived around 7:15 we were pleasantly surprised to get seated immediately. I figured we would have a significant wait based on the number of cars in the lot, but the place is pretty big apparently and several tables were open. As we sat in our booth and waited for our server I salivated at the thought of the delicious root beer. It turned out that our waiter was also taking care of a big group and by the time he finally came by we were saturated with anxiety and thirst. We sent him away for our beverages immediately and looked over the menus he left behind. When he came back shortly after without the root beer, we were a little dismayed but gave him our orders with the help of some managerial-type persons veggie recommendations.He brought back our drinks and within 10 minutes the food followed. The Fish Fry special consists of three large chunks of cod which amounts to about 9oz. The fillets were cloaked with an incredibly thick beer batter which actually had a decent taste, but a very spongy texture. It totally encased the fish which led to the cod being pretty greasy. In fact, I was scalded with squirting fish grease on more than one occasion while chomping into them. The fish itself was not really flaky and bordered on mushiness due to the amount of grease. It also seemed like the fillets were not of the highest quality as some had a brownish color to them. In the end I was only able to eat two of the three pieces and wound up taking a doggie bag home. The steak fries that came along for the ride were good, but there were hardly any, especially when you consider the amount of fish present. In addition, they were kind of under fried as were the limp and lifeless sweet potato fries that I also got to try. When they slapped the fish down in front of me it was evident that the less than half filled cup of tartar would not be nearly enough and I immediately requested another, to which they (almost spitefully) brought three more, filled to the brim. If the server and manager-guy had not been so pleasant earlier I would have thought something was amiss, but Im marking it as a new restaurant being eager to please, for now. The tartar was thick and creamy and helped to make the heavy fish more edible. For some reason Sprechers Restaurant has decided to not include any bread with their Fish Fry which is a huge mistake and really makes me wonder what is going on, especially since $13 isnt exactly cheap for cod. The slaw was also erroneous, as the bland, watery mixture totally missed the mark.  When all was said and done I only got through one refill on my 10oz glass of root beer. Some of the blame falls on the server and the rest on the overly rich and heavy Fish Fry. Overall, I cant recommend this Fish Fry and will probably not be back for it any time soon. While the fish tasted alright, it was not flaky or tender and just cant compete with some of the better Fish Frys out there. The French fries and tartar were fine, but certainly not enough to salvage the meal, especially considering the lackluster slaw and lack of bread period. For Petes sake, even the root beer was a bit of a let down. It wasnt served in a frosty mug and was no better than a bottle fresh from the fridge at home. Unfortunately, the Fish Fry at Sprechers Restaurant and Bar was not the simple pleasure I was hoping for, although it sounds like the rest of their menu is good so we may be back at some point, just not for the fish.sprecherspub.com/index.php1262 John Q.

The reason? The cod.The no-frills Friday lunch special at the Badger Bowl is available as a 2 or 3-piece, and comes with all the standard accoutrements (plus a soda). Once our order reached the kitchen the food was ready in no time (the printer they use to transfer them from the bar to the kitchen jammed and it took a minute or two for them to realize what was going on and fix it). The cod was nice and hot, and much tastier than I remembered it being. It was light and flaky, but somewhat slick due to a little bit of grease. Thankfully, the entrapped oil wasnt gross, and didnt saturate the batter. The batter itself was golden brown and almost seemed to have a glow about it. It boasted a superb flavor that gave the snowy cod a real boost. It was flat-out delicious, and theres not much more that needs to be said (other than I wish I would have ordered a 3-piece). Some Julienne-cut spuds came with the fish, but were clearly fried during the printer jam. They were lukewarm when they arrived and pretty much cold by the end of the meal. The portion was also incredibly small and left me unsatisfied. The tartar was thick and tasty, but had a very strong relish overtone. It was potent, but fortunately the fish had some might of its own the spirited sauce wasnt able to take total control. Rounding it all out was a fresh dinner roll, and some finely-chopped coleslaw. The roll was soft and fluffy, and torn-off to perfection. The slaw was homemade and kind of elegant (for slaw), and while I think it could use a little kick, it was inoffensive and pleasurable, and probably pleasing for the masses. Fish is the one element that can make or break a Fish Fry, and in this case it totally made it. While the fries, tartar, coleslaw, and roll were all adequate, the cod is what really made the meal matter, and in the end that is just how its supposed to be. Overall, I recommend the Fish Fry at the Badger Bowl, and will come back any time I want good fish for a fair price or if I feel like bowling. www.badgerbowl.com506 E.

We are more or less addicted to the Wisconsin tradition and simply cant imagine a circumstance that would cause us to stop going out for Friday fish. Our dedication (or gluttony depending on how you look at it) pays off, as visiting places numerous times allows us to average out sub-par and/or freakishly good visits in our rankings. This normalizing is necessary at times since it is possible to go to a great place, and get less than great fish due to poor service and the like. Therefore, we believe a Fish Fry is not a one and done deal. Since the Badger Bowl started offering a Fish Fry in early 2010 we have had them on our radar, and kept them there. Weve patronized the Bowl exclusively during the lunch hour due to the fact that they are one of a handful of places that actually serves the Friday treat before 5pm. Since I had one regular and a couple newbies this week I figured that the Southside establishment was as good a place as any to set up shop. We took the short cruise down an extremely torn-up Park Street and found ourselves lane-side just before noon. We took one of the few open tables big enough for a party of four (the place was bumpin), and waited for our waitress to make her way through the crowd of fish-heads. Eventually she happened upon us and we wasted no time ordering a round of Fish Frys and drinks in one fell swoop. The service was relatively speedy considering how busy the Bowl was, and our fish arrived roughly 10 or 15 minutes after the order went in - nice and hot, as it should be. The cod looked idyllic as the golden-brown beer batter that cloaked the thick chunks practically glistened under the lights. I snagged one of the two pieces and tore through the medium-thick batter into the creamy cod. The fish was fairly flaky, and blended well with the rich batter. Extremely rich and creamy isnt exactly my ideal fish combo (I prefer a light and flaky breading), but this cod was very good as far as that style is concerned.  The overall taste was pleasing, and, both of the average-sized pieces were gone in and instant.On par with the fish was a fair portion of thick-cut Julienne French fries. While I would definitely have liked to see a few more on the plate, those that managed to make it were well fried and quite scrumptious. Their crispness paired well with the tartar which was composed of about 95% mayo with just enough relish to keep things interesting. The extremely velvety sauce also blended flawlessly with the creamy cod creating a richness that is almost off the charts. There is definitely not a shortage of calories in this 2-piece. Coming along for the ride were a standard dinner roll and the homemade Badger slaw. The slaw lacked zest, but even so, I enjoyed the creamy concoction and put away the whole cup with no problem. The roll was also no match for my appetite and not a crumb of the soft white bun remained after all was said and done. At meals end, we retreated to the parking lot with plans on nursing our bursting bellies as we made the quick trip back to our respective offices. Unfortunately, an immediate retreat to the comforts of campus was not to be, as a perilously potholed Park Street had the last laugh, and left us one tire down. We changed the flat in the blink of an eye, sped to Holmes to drop the deflated donut, and zipped back to campus in no time, our bodies fueled by the calorific cod, and fattening fries. Flat tire aside, this was another wildly successful trip to the Badger Bowl. After thrice visiting the luxurious lanes, not much has changed, but then again, not much needs to. The fish was really good, especially if you are a fan of the thicker beer batters. The heavy tartar complimented the cod perfectly while fairly good fries, a regular roll, and handsomely-portioned homemade coleslaw did what they needed to do. The Fish Fry at the Badger Bowl is certainly the total package, and it looks like the fish friendly folks in Madison have finally picked up on it. www.badgerbowl.com506 E.

Sure, some may leave a little something to be desired, but if you do the work you can find a plethora of delicious options to choose from. One of the newer Fish Frys on the block can be found at the Badger Bowl on Madisons South Side. Even though the Bowl may be the new kid, they certainly have already figured a few things out.For starters, they are keyed into the fact that there are a good amount of people who want their fish for lunch. They cater to this crowd and start putting out plates at 11AM for those who just cant wait until dinner time, like us. For the first time in what seems like forever, the core trio that comprises Madison Fish Fry was back at the table together and ready for some lunch. I pulled in right at noon to find Jer and Gabe had already arrived and put in our orders. I scored my soda (included in the $8.25 price tag) and no more than 5 minutes later our plates protruded from the kitchen and fell into our eagerly awaiting arms. As per usual, after a full morning of thinking about Fish Fry I was starving. I wasted no time and tore into one of my two beer battered fillets and damn near burned my mouth  this stuff was fresh from the fryer and steaming hot. The batter was very tasty, and while it looked thick, was actually pretty light. The fish itself was also flavorful, and although it was not super flaky, it was certainly good enough, and not mushy by any means. The overall taste sensation of fish and batter was very satisfying, especially when coupled with the delicious tartar. As far as beer battered cod goes, this stuff is up there. The Badger Bowl also has a good handle on what makes a good tartar. Their sauce was thick and creamy, and blended well with the rich cod. It was based on a hefty percentage of mayo and spiked with a tiny, practically unnoticeable amount of dill. A near perfect hint of relish rounded out the mix and gave it the necessary punch.The impressive shine of the cod and tartar cast a bit of a shadow on the French fries and left them dimly lit. While the straight cut potatoes were fried to a near perfect golden-brown, they were just not superb. In addition there werent really very many of them and I ran out well before I finished cod #2. While this isnt a huge deal, I do get bummed when I run out that quickly. The folks at The Bowl are clearly quick studies and since our last visit have added a roll without upping the price. Madison Fish Fry takes the inclusion of bread with his fish very seriously and when it isnt there, it is noted. The plain roll that they have added is a perfect complement to the meal and really helps to round it out. Their slaw is also nothing special, but then again, it doesnt really have to be. At least the creamy concoction is there and serves as a nice palate cleanser in between bites of fish. After a second visit to the Badger Bowl it is clear that they have learned a thing or two and are doing their best to improve their Fish Fry. If they keep at it they could find themselves in highly recommendable territory in no time  hell, they arent that far away now. The cod and tartar are really good, and bordering on excellence. The fries, slaw and roll all play their parts admirably as well, although none of them are over the top. Overall, this is an easy Fish Fry to recommend and I am impressed by their constant willingness to improve. If you are a Fish Fry fan, and who isnt, go to The Badger Bowl, you just might learn a thing or two.www.badgerbowl.com506 E.

Since I wasnt really interested in perusing the assorted outdoorsy implements and services on display at the exhibition, I proposed to my dad that we hit up the Badger Bowl instead. Luckily, my aunt came along to keep my mom company at the show leaving Dad and I free to skip across the Beltline to roll a couple games. A few things really impressed me about the Badger Bowl on this, my first, visit. Beyond the fact that there are a massive amount of well cared for lanes, their dining area was much nicer than I was expecting. It was very spacious and surprisingly upscale looking. I figured this was the kind of place where a Fish Fry would be right at home. While the alley and bar were great what was most impressive was some kid who was bowling a couple lanes away from us. He was probably 15-16 and I swear to god, must have been Pete Webers son. He was simply amazing and I dont think I saw him miss a single pin. It was strike after strike, smooth as butter. This kid was lights-out.This visit was back in 2008 and when I inquired as to why they didnt have a Fish Fry I was not really given an answer. Well, it only took them a couple years to figure it out, but they finally got around to offering a Friday Fish Fry as of February 19, 2010. I gave them a couple weeks to get into the groove before I decided to put them on the chopping block on the 12th of March. I showed up for lunch at 11:30, sat at the bar, and gave my order to the bartender when she came by.The cod came 5 minutes or so after I ordered and was hot, hot, hot. I scooped one of the two pieces up right away and had at it. The fish was good and fairly flaky although it was bordering on losing its texture to the small amount of the grease present. The grease could be attributed to the beer batter which was pretty thick, but thankfully not heavy. The batter had a surprisingly good taste which worked well with the thick cuts of cod. Like the fish, the Julienne cut fries were well cooked and hot as can be when served. There were a fair amount of them which is nice because I have been getting skimpier portions than I like lately. Since I got them fresh from the fryer they were nice and hot throughout my entire meal. However, these are the type of fries that get firm and flavorless if they have to sit for any amount of time, so I kind of felt like I lucked out.The tartar sauce was a good blend and complimented the cod well. It was creamy and heavy on the mayo, with a tiny bit of relish, and just a hint of dill. The overall taste was satisfying as the dill was in such a scant amount that it was unnoticeable. I believe it was probably homemade, unlike the tiny cup of coleslaw which was clearly Sysco at its finest. I am almost coming to expect a lack of bread with the lunch-time Fish Fry, and while it is becoming expected it is no less of a let down. Like Mulligans and The Echo Tap before it, The Badger Bowl didnt have a piece to spare. Even though they substitute a fountain soda for the bread, it is no less of a loss in my book.Overall, I can easily recommend this Fish Fry even without some sort of bread. The service was as quick as lightning since the bar and kitchen were both well staffed which led to me being in and out in less than a half hour. The $8.25 price tag is on the high end for a lunch fry, but is somewhat offset by the inclusion of the soda so I didnt feel ripped off or anything. The dinner version gets a bump in price to $9.50, but I presume it comes with some bread, although the soda is excluded at night. There is also a 3-piece available for $11.50 after 4:30.Ultimately, I had hoped the Fish Fry at the Badger Bowl would be reminiscent of the performance of Pete Weber Jr. on our first visit. While it wasnt legendary like young Pete, it was pretty good. They certainly didnt throw a perfect game, but they are carrying a steady 200 average which is certainly nothing to scoff at. I feel comfortable with Badger Bowls synopsis that they know the score. Apparently it applies not only to bowling, but also Fish Fry. www.badgerbowl.com506 E.

If you are like me, then you are no doubt are skeptical when it comes to ethnic restaurants offering our famous Wisconsin Friday night tradition. Needless to say, I have been less than pleased with the offerings at places like  Dobahn  or  The Bourbon Street Grill, and have made a concerted effort to avoid them all together. When word came down the pipeline that Pedros Mexican Restaurant was quietly offering a great Fish Fry, I was indeed skeptical, but knew what had to be done. I saddled up my trusty burro, and hit the dusty trail to risk my Friday on the rumor of Fritada de Pescado delicioso a Pedros.We arrived at Pedros right around 7pm and were somewhat surprised to see the IMMEDIATE SEATING light aglow above the entryway. We figured they might be busy with a bunch of anti-fish folks, but the sign turned out to be accurate and we had no trouble getting right in. We were ushered to our booth adjacent to the tortilla station without a wait, and our waitress came by a couple minutes later with some chips and dip, and a basket of tortillas. She also dropped some menus before heading off to grab us a Negra Modelo and a margarita from the bar. When she came back with the booze she took our orders as best she could in between our mouthfuls of chips and salsa.We polished of nearly the entire basket of chips and about 2/3 of the salsa by the time my fish arrived. At first glace the Fish Fry looked great. The tartar sauce and coleslaw were served in little tortilla bowls which gave them a festive flair - this is a Mexican joint after all. The three pieces of haddock, French fries and the rye bread were positioned around this decorative crockery and made for an idyllic scene. Unfortunately, the plate must have sat for a tad bit before being served because the food wasnt scalding hot which allowed the haddock to get greased up a little. While it looked like the fish was ultra flaky at one time, the grease caused it to lose some of its texture and the planes of fish started melting into one another. By and large it still tasted good, but if it came out fresh from the fryer with less grease it could have been great. The Dos Equis beer batter was fairly light, but as for taste, it was just so-so.The French fries were fairly decent although there were so few of them they were gone faster than Speedy Gonzalez with a block of queso. Before I knew it, I looked down, and they were just none to be found, all that remained was a cloud of dust. The tartar on the other hand was abundant, although it was a little odd really. This Chipotle blend was an interesting take on the sauce, but actually pretty damn good. I used the bulk of it since it gave the fish a little kick that was lacking in the soggy batter. Two full pieces of rye bread and some homemade slaw rounded out the meal. The marble rye bread is very traditional and actually tasted really good when paired with a few bites of the slaw. That being said, the hefty serving of slaw wasnt great by itself as it was a little runny and lacked any zest. Overall, I was a little surprised by the Fish Fry at Pedros. While some of the individual items may not have been great, when you look at the whole picture this Fish Fry recommendable. The fish was fine, albeit a little too greasy, and their fries and unique take on tartar sauce were good. It seems like forever since I have had rye bread at a Fish Fry, who would have guessed that one of the few places keeping up this tradition would be a Mexican joint? Pedros is probably most famous for their Buy 1, Get 1 margarita specials, but they are also known for their reasonably priced, inoffensive Mexican cuisine and their version of the Wisconsin Fish Fry seems to follow suit. Inoffensive Fish Fry and plenty of it, I can deal with that. www.pedrosmexicanrestaurant.com499 Donofrio DriveMadison, WI(608) 833-9229",3872,0.14793915343915343,0.4760370370370372

Whenever I visited I found the décor to be inviting and the service to be very good, even if their homemade beer didnt suit my tastes. For one reason or another, the Angelic didnt survive and was forced to close its doors. Since the place was so nice I had a feeling it would be back up and running in no time flat. Well, it took a little while, and they are no longer brewing their own beer (which is probably a good thing), but the food spot is back, this time in the form of Logans Madtown.Apparently there is some back story involving Tony Romo and the owner of the Logans franchise which led to its arrival in Madison. I dont really want to get into it here, but there is an autographed picture of the former Wisconsonite hanging above the bar so I assume it isnt total BS. I happened upon their Facebook page randomly and saw that they were offering an AYCE Fish Fry all day long. I recruited my regulars and we set foot to LogansWe all arrived at roughly the same time and grabbed an open table near the bar. Since the place was deserted at 11:30 on a Friday I was already worried, but tried to write it off as them being so new that people just hadnt caught on yet. It was self delusion at its finest; I knew we were in trouble. We all went for the AYCE and waited the surprisingly long time for it our food. I say surprisingly long because it took at least 20 minutes for it to be ready even though we were literally one of two small groups in the whole place, what is going on in that kitchen, I thought.The food arrived, and as I suspected was not scalding hot. The first round of cod had a very light, almost white colored batter. It was not flaky and lacked flavor, although the actual fish was decent so it wasnt a total loss. When the time came for the second round, their ship totally sank. Jer and I each asked for one more piece, of course, she brought back full orders of 3 pieces each. While that in itself wasnt a problem, the fish was. Round two was clearly different fish from round one. The pieces were longer and thinner and while they looked much better they tasted much, much worse, which is really saying something because even round one wasnt great. The batter on this supplemental fish had a nice golden color and was actually really light, although not tasty. The fish itself had a nasty fishy taste and was simply gross. It had a mushy texture and pretty much put the final touch on ruining this Fish Fry all three of us, as Gabe even tried a piece to verify its awfulness.I was also let down by the potato served. I read somewhere that the French fires at Logans are to die for and was really hoping to give them a try. Without warning, or prompting from the waitress, our plates arrived with greasy, undercooked American fries which just didnt cut the mustard. The tartar was also a let down as the thin mix was more ranch than tartar and really didnt improve the fish, although Im not sure any tartar could have improved the fish that came in the second round.In addition, there was no bread served which I find absolutely ridiculous at an AYCE Fish Fry, especially considering this IS the same meal you get for dinner. Apparently they try to make up this discrepancy with a butt load of their homemade looking coleslaw which was actually really good, but, cmonOverall, we dont recommend this Fish Fry. Even the first round was probably not good enough to be recommended, but after round two it was clear, there is no way. While the service was pretty decent it was not above reproach, and since the place was practically empty all the unnecessary waitresses were just kind of milling around the bar looking depressed which totally killed the atmosphere. A less than spectacular Fish Fry, decent, but uninspired service, I mean, Logans, what is going on here? You guys had better get this thing together quick, or you will be joining the angels just like your predecessor. Maybe the late night bar scene is good? I hope for their sake it is, because if not, it's going to be bye-bye Logans in no time. 322 W Johnson StreetMadison, WI 53703     (608) 287-1404",4253,0.0684691919191919,0.47657045454545455

As soon as you step foot into Minnesota the chances of finding fish are much slimmer, and even if you happen upon one it probably isnt going to be anything special. Therefore, any time Im heading to Minny on a Friday I try to fill up before hitting the bridge, and more often than not the filling is done at The Hungry Peddler in La Crosse.The Peddler is a pretty great little place with a pretty great little Fish Fry to match. They feature their $12 AYCE beer battered cod all day on Friday, although I wasnt feeling up to that task at 2pm when we rolled in. I instead opted for the $9 2-piece off the Light Eaters menu, which turned out to be more than enough for lunch since it still comes with all of the standard supper club trimmings. Before the fish a basket full of garlic toasts and another one full of cellophane-wrapped breadsticks and crackers showed up. It was an abundant assortment, but unfortunately they were not accompanied by any cheese dip, which, when it comes right down to it, is really the whole point. It was a bit of a bummer, but not a deal-breaker. Along with the crispy starches came my clam chowder which turned out to be a little runny and not very clammy. The clam-less chowder left me wishing Id chosen the coleslaw or the side salad instead. The fish took longer than expected to show up, but was hotter than all get out when it did. The pieces of cod were hefty which made for an adequate portion for lunch time (the AYCE would have been WAAAAY too much). I enjoyed every bite of the flaky, high quality fish, although it got slightly greasy thanks to the golden beer batter that sheathed it. As I tend to do, I rotated the pieces periodically so the grease didnt settle too much, but it was somewhat cumbersome to have to do. By and large, the cod was tasty and the slight amount of grease that came with it that can be overlooked. While the cod was hearty, the 2-piece looked pretty wimpy next to the hash browns with cheese and onion that ruled the plate. The gigantic portion of shredded spuds was large and in charge, complete with a ton of onion, a couple slices of American cheese. They were simply delicious, and on par with the best of the best out there. A creamy tartar took the cod to the next level, and while the relish ratio was a little off, the homemade sauce still did what it needed to do. If you find yourself in La Crosse on a Friday dont hesitate to stop by The Hungry Peddler for fish. The place is quaint, the food is tasty, and the people are friendly  just be aware that The Peddler is tiny, and can get very busy on Friday nights. Overall, I highly recommend this Fish Fry, and really look forward to it every time I find myself Minnesota-bound on a Friday. www.hungrypeddlerlacrosse.com3429 Mormon Coulee RoadLa Crosse, WI 54601     (608) 788-8206",2951,0.22483098177542618,0.4525896531452087

Well, as fate would have it we found ourselves passing through the river city not but one week later, and wouldnt ya know it, it just happened to be lunchtime. Since the Hungry Peddler was right on our route west we decided to pull in and grab a bite. The old roadhouse turned restaurant is nothing if not cozy - seating a max of 60 patrons or so - but since we were a little on the back end of the lunch hour there were plenty of tables to go around (even ones not adjacent to the bathroom!). Our trio took a spot, and were delighted to see the supper club style bread plate (cellophane sticks, and mini garlic toasts) awaiting our arrival. We dug in. The waitress came by. Even during lunch the Peddler is pushing their AYCE Fish Fry, and I cant say I blame them  its a good deal if you come hungry. Whats more, the $11 bottomless cod comes with the works ANNNND you can mix-n-match their chicken with your fried and/or baked fish! One could get in big trouble here, folks Our waitress was an old pro, no BS, but very courteous and friendly  just what you expect at a place like the Peddler. She buzzed away with our orders as quickly as she had come to take them and returned in no time with sides of slaw and soup. The coleslaw served with the AYCE Fish Fry is easily enough for two and featured the creamy zest of supper club slaw at its finest. The soup was also splendid from all reports and like the slaw a good start to meal for those who went that route. No more than 15 minutes passed before a steaming hot plate of fish came our way. The first plate contained a bevy of what appeared to be three golden fried beauties. The cuts were slightly larger than average and clearly high quality. The fish was flaky, but surprisingly greasy considering how light the batter on it was. Luckily, the grease was as light as the batter and didnt cause it to get soggy or fall off. As a good batter does, this stuff clung to the cod for dear life, but unfortunately had its delicate nuances compromised by a subtle shrimp-y flavor. Clearly the HP doesnt isolate a fryer just for the fish and some leftover flavor leached into the otherwise smooth cod. While it was a bit of a turnoff, its not quite a deal breaker, and the overall taste was still good. After polishing off the original plate and sides (see below) we only had room for one more piece on round two and it was even more shrimp-y than the first round, which was confirmation enough for us. At the Peddler cheese and onion are an upgrade to your hash browns, but an upgrade thats worth every penny. The generous portion of shredded spuds is slathered with two slices of American, ample onion, and fried just as they should be. The tartar was also dead-on, as the homemade sauce was stick-to-your-ribs thick, and had enough zip to overcome the shrimp-y substrate of the cod. There was also WAAAY more than enough of it to go around  just ask if you run low. ;)Once again The Hungry Peddler did the trick, and their bountiful fish, superb sides, and well-rounded meal are more than enough to keep us coming back. In addition, there rest of the menu overflows with great food at reasonable prices, so even if you find yourself in La Crosse on a non-Friday you can find a what you need at the Peddler. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and would say it is the best youre gonna find within the city limits of La Crosse.www.hungrypeddlerlacrosse.com3429 Mormon Coulee RoadLa Crosse, WI 54601     (608) 788-8206",3618,0.20253663003663008,0.49524175824175826

In fact, growing up in southwestern Wisconsin I can only remember a handful of times where I saw the birds in their native habitat. I happened to be in the La Crosse area and my parents mentioned that several hundred eagles were currently nesting and feeding on the backwaters of the Mississippi near La Crescent. Since I figured it could be a once in a lifetime opportunity I gave it serious consideration; when they added that we could grab dinner at the Hungry Peddler afterwards, it sealed the deal. I heard the Hungry Peddler was peddling some seriously tasty fish, and since I hadnt eaten a great Fish Fry for a couple weeks, I decided to take the off-night plunge (the 23rd being a Tuesday rather than a Friday). We arrived around 7:30 or so, and grabbed a spot in the wide open parking lot. Rumor has it this place gets crammed on Friday nights and upon entering I could immediately see why: Maximum Occupancy  60. Lets just say the Peddler is not exactly the La Crosse Center. Luckily for us, Tuesday was quite a different story and only 3 groups or so had shown up for the $12.99 T-Bone special or the $7.99 AYCE Spaghetti, we had no problem getting a spot. When presented with the menu by the speedy waitress I immediately looked for some sort of fried fish. I had a feeling they would have cod, and I was right. I was even more excited when she confirmed that it was exactly the same as the Friday Fish Fry, only with an additional side, but without a special price. Prior to our entrées we were treated to many of the classic supper club staples. A plethora of breads led the charge, including: dinner rolls, crispy garlic squares, and packaged breadsticks. They were accompanied by a makeshift relish tray with a couple pickles, carrots and radishes. Not a bad start. In addition, I got sides of cottage cheese and coleslaw for my $13, whereas I would only have gotten one side on Friday when the fish becomes AYCE and goes for $11. We indulged in these appetizers and about ten minutes later my fish and my parents lasagna showed up. I immediately tried to grab one of my three pieces of cod and found it simply too hot to handle. When I finally got a piece into my beak it was immediately apparent, this is good fish. The cod was light and fall apart flaky and had a batter to match. While this batter was light and flaky it wasnt ultra flavorful, but was good enough to make the fish recommendable. Even though it was nice and light it somehow managed to get fairly greasy as it sat. Overall, the flakiness outweighed the grease resulting in tasty fish. Crinkle cut fries accompanied the fish and were also scalding hot when they appeared. They were well fried and the portion size was fair. The cup of tartar was also fairly portioned and lasted through the fish. The thick and creamy sauce had just the perfect amount of relish and was right on the money. It improved the fish and made the grease present almost unnoticeable. Overall, I feel comfortable highly recommending this Fish Fry. The fish was very good as were the fries and the tartar. In addition you get all the little supper club perks which is worth extra in my book. To top it off, the service was fast and friendly, probably partially because the place was almost empty. I can imagine on a busy Friday the place might get very cramped, but the atmosphere and great food seem like they would be worth the hour-plus wait.Seeing a couple hundred bald eagles in one spot is an amazing site. It made me wonder how something like this was not on the local, and possibly national, news. A species, once on the verge of extinction, back in mass numbers, and no one wants to see it? It was a complete mystery to me that this was going overlooked. I guess, in the same way, I had managed to overlook the Fish Fry at the Hungry Peddler. I think we all need to take a moment to reflect on what this great American icon and what it means to us as Wisconsinites. It is a symbol of our freedom to choose, and of our wisdom. Even though we may be down, we are strong, and will be back to The Hungry Peddler that is, I hope you didnt still think I was talking about birds?

Picassos has recently opened a second restaurant in McFarland, and of course, they are serving a Friday night Fish Fry. Picassos refers to their food as Urban Gourmet Cuisine which is a bit of a stretch in my book, but whatever; all I am really concerned with is their self-proclaimed unique take on the Fish Fry. When it comes to the Fry, unique and delicious rarely go hand in hand, but when you are trying to find the best, you gotta try em all.On Friday nights Picassos branches out from pizza and pasta and offers three tantalizing Fish Fry options: a house favorite walleye, lake perch and beer battered cod. Based on my previous experiences at Picassos  Madison, there was no way in hell I was ever going to try the cod again. Every time Ive had it at the Madison location it was bland and greasy with a thick batter that I really didnt enjoy. However, when presented with the menu, the Spotted Cow Beer Battered Cod grabbed my attention and I was unable to will myself away from it. Oh! Cruel Picasso, why must you temp me with the Cow? Like a fool, I put in my order and was presented with the two massive fillets 10 minutes, or so, later.The fish came direct from the fryer and was nice and hot, I will give them that. The fillets were cloaked in the thick, golden Cow batter which glistened under the icicle Christmas lights that Picassos passes off as decoration. The actual fish was okay, but not as flaky as I would have liked thanks to some grease which was trapped by its bovine-battered shell. The cod actually had a decent flavor, but was dominated by the taste of the thick beer batter. Overall it was a little too heavy and didnt have a good fish:batter ratio. The French fries that accompanied the cod were also nice and hot when served. They looked very Sysco-ish, but were well fried and peppered with a hefty dose of salt. The tartar was not quite as appetizing and a little unusual frankly. It was very smooth and had a zesty, ranch like quality. While it actually tasted alright by itself, it did little to help the cod. Since it was very untraditional, and not helpful, they lost some points on its behalf.The coleslaw mirrored the fries in that it looked like it came straight from a big Sysco jug, but still tasted great. It was a creamy blend, heavy on the carrots, and with just enough pop. The garlic bun that partnered with the slaw was also pretty good and a unique departure from the norm that actually worked. Like the cod, it glistened under the icicles thanks to a generous coating of garlic butter.Overall, this Fish Fry is just not quite recommendable, no matter how much I would like it to be. While there was nothing glaringly wrong with the meal there was nothing glaring right either. Since I wont be back for it any time soon I cant really recommend it to anyone else. There are simply way better options out there. The fish was fine, but a little too battered, while the fries and slaw were good, but a little too commercial. Weird tartar, paired with an untraditional roll didnt help matters, and the hit-and-miss service was also strange. Our waitress was friendly enough, but she was absent from the dining room for long periods of time. When I was ready to order another Spotted Cow she was nowhere to be found, which was a total bummer cause I was thirsty. In the end if you are willing to travel this far into McFarland for fish, you should probably just jump across the street and hit up the Maple Tree instead. I know that is what I wish we would have done. Or better yet, just stop at Tobys on the way.http://www.picassosonline.com/4706 Farwell StreetMcFarland, WI 53558     (608) 579-1200",3745,0.10469367015098725,0.47989256678281067

Unfortunately, when you are trying to find the greatest in Fish Fry, this scenario plays out repeatedly. Someone will tell you, you have gotta try such and such, they are the best, then you go there only to find it to be not at all what you were expecting. While this is no ones fault, it is an unavoidable consequence of personal taste. A little birdy told me that the Seafood Center is one of, if not THE, best Fish Fry in town. Grandiose claim, I know, but it seemed to be well supported by the online community. Armed with what I felt was reputable info, I proceeded to the Seafood Center to procure myself some takeout.The Seafood Center on Whitney Way has been around forever, but fairly recently, spun off another location on Old Sauk Road. Since I assumed the locations to be identical, for all intents and purposes, I just picked one and headed out. Upon arriving at the Old Sauk location around 6pm and I was pleased to see that I would not be eating my takeout in the car as planned (they have a counter and some stools along the wall where 6 or so people can sit and eat). As soon as someone behind the main counter was ready, my order was taken: one $9.50 lake perch with an additional piece of cod (the SC lets you tack on as many pieces as you want at less than two bucks a pop). I paid, and then waited the 10 minutes, or so, until my order was ready. I grabbed a stool and tore into my bag of fried goods. I went right for a piece of perch and plunged it into the huge cup of tartar. The perch was really quite good. The six, or so, small fillets were pretty firm, but maintained a flaky texture. They were covered in a light batter which clung to the fish well, but did not have a lot of flavor. Unfortunately, as I expected based on the numerous bottles for sale around the establishment, the tartar was straight-up Kraft, and was just horrible. It did not improve the taste of the fish one bit, and if fact, made it quite objectionable. The two massive cups went to waste as the bulk of my fish was consumed sans-tartar. Luckily for them, the perch and cod were good enough to stand on their own. Speaking of the cod, the flaky-white pieces were wafer thin and enjoyed the same batter as the perch. I actually think the batter worked a little bit better on the cod which seemed to be moister and more succulent than the perch. Overall, both were good, but damned by the Kraft.  Furthermore, the fish was steaming hot and must have come directly from the fryer while the French fries clearly did not. They were lukewarm by the time I got at them, but still tasted pretty darn good. They were thick cut and looked homemade, but all I could think was that they would be excellent if they were a little hotter.Of course, even though we are in Wisconsin and Fish Fry is King, the Seafood Center bills their Friday fare as Fish-n-Chips, and lets the bread fall by the wayside. For shame. Although an abundant amount of slaw does come along for the ride, it in no way makes up for the lack of starch even if it is decent, as this stuff was.Overall, I think this fish and fries at the Seafood Center are recommendable, but the commercial tartar and lack of bread make the total experience a bit of a downer. When you add in the fact that they mainly focus on takeout, it makes the dining experience even more lackluster to the point that I probably will not be back. It also turns out that $9.50 for lake perch sounds like a sweet deal, but when the portion is small, and no bread is included, it really isnt a bargain. I do like the fact that you can add additional pieces, and assume that if I lived close enough I would just get takeout and use my own homemade tartar. As it stands, with no bread being served, and Kraft as the tartar of choice, this is just not the Fish Fry for me.

Since I assumed the locations to be identical, for all intents and purposes, I just picked one and headed out. Upon arriving at the Old Sauk location around 6pm and I was pleased to see that I would not be eating my takeout in the car as planned (they have a counter and some stools along the wall where 6 or so people can sit and eat). As soon as someone behind the main counter was ready, my order was taken: one $9.50 lake perch with an additional piece of cod (the SC lets you tack on as many pieces as you want at less than two bucks a pop). I paid, and then waited the 10 minutes, or so, until my order was ready. I grabbed a stool and tore into my bag of fried goods. I went right for a piece of perch and plunged it into the huge cup of tartar. The perch was really quite good. The six, or so, small fillets were pretty firm, but maintained a flaky texture. They were covered in a light batter which clung to the fish well, but did not have a lot of flavor. Unfortunately, as I expected based on the numerous bottles for sale around the establishment, the tartar was straight-up Kraft, and was just horrible. It did not improve the taste of the fish one bit, and if fact, made it quite objectionable. The two massive cups went to waste as the bulk of my fish was consumed sans-tartar. Luckily for them, the perch and cod were good enough to stand on their own. Speaking of the cod, the flaky-white pieces were wafer thin and enjoyed the same batter as the perch. I actually think the batter worked a little bit better on the cod which seemed to be moister and more succulent than the perch. Overall, both were good, but damned by the Kraft.  Furthermore, the fish was steaming hot and must have come directly from the fryer while the French fries clearly did not. They were lukewarm by the time I got at them, but still tasted pretty darn good. They were thick cut and looked homemade, but all I could think was that they would be excellent if they were a little hotter.Of course, even though we are in Wisconsin and Fish Fry is King, the Seafood Center bills their Friday fare as Fish-n-Chips, and lets the bread fall by the wayside. For shame. Although an abundant amount of slaw does come along for the ride, it in no way makes up for the lack of starch even if it is decent, as this stuff was.Overall, I think this fish and fries at the Seafood Center are recommendable, but the commercial tartar and lack of bread make the total experience a bit of a downer. When you add in the fact that they mainly focus on takeout, it makes the dining experience even more lackluster to the point that I probably will not be back. It also turns out that $9.50 for lake perch sounds like a sweet deal, but when the portion is small, and no bread is included, it really isnt a bargain. I do like the fact that you can add additional pieces, and assume that if I lived close enough I would just get takeout and use my own homemade tartar. As it stands, with no bread being served, and Kraft as the tartar of choice, this is just not the Fish Fry for me.

We hath overlooked the sanctity of thine all you can eat buffet and opted for a defined portion on others terms. We ask for your forgiveness, and beg for you to be merciful.  One of the great sins in the land of the Fish Fry is to choose against an all you can eat Fish Fry and go for a lesser amount. For some reason on our trip to The New Glarus Hotel we committed this exact atrocity. I spose it has to do with the fact that other AYCE buffets are really hit and miss (case and point, Fitzgeralds) and we didnt want to risk it. I like my fish right from the kitchen, but as the old saying goes, When in Rome We, unfortunately, did not do as the Romans, even though the waitress was pushing the buffet and it seemed like the popular choice among our fellow diners. Like the Nazi guy in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, we chose poorly. The $12.00 haddock dinners we picked instead consisted of five to six lightly battered pieces which I suspect were grabbed right off the buffet table. The batter was very flavorful, but had a little grease (although the grease was pretty tasty in and of itself). The bone white haddock was flaky and when paired with the batter produced a delightful result. I devoured the scant portion and was left longing for more, and wishing I had went for the upgrade. Accompanying my fish was a generous pile of matchstick fries which were nice and hot. These heavily salted numbers were fried just right and not available on the buffet (I dont think). There was another option with the AYCE and while the portion I got was plenty, it is nice to know I could have had more if I had chosen more wisely.I also presume I could have gotten more of the ranch-esque tartar on the buffet which would have been nice since as our waitress never brought me the second one that I requested. I basically knew I was going to need an additional cup as soon as I she set down the first one as it was barely bigger than a thimble. This aint sewing class sister; you might as well chuck this thimble-cup out the window and grab me an ice cream scoop, cause there is no way this thing is gonna cut the mustard. The diminutive amount of sauce was good, but it was cleaned out well before the petite portion of fish even. Boo.The bread that came prior to fish was acceptable with one caraway-rye (or something along those lines) and two plain white rolls comprising the trio. The rye had a nice sour taste, while the plain white roll had a hard crust that wasnt to Gabes or Is liking.Since the New Glarus Hotel is kind of supper clubby place they have some fringe benefits that you wont get everywhere. These include some deliciously sassy baked beans, a nice looking salad bar and freshly tapped Spotted Cow. There was also a serious hootenanny taking place as many of the locals were kicking up their heels to the sounds of an authentic Swiss band. The New Glarus Hotel is certainly not short on culture (or tasty food for that matter).Initially I wasnt sure if we had made the right choice, but as I sat in our booth with a only a bare plate remaining in front of me I realized that my suspicions were true - not getting the AYCE was a huge mistake. The buffet was the focus of everyones attention, including the cooks who were especially concerned with it and constantly checking it for freshness. In addition, the buffet also had cod, so we could have tried another option in addition to the tasty haddock, and built our database even further. Overall, this is an easy Fish Fry to recommend, but we pulled a serious gaffe by not getting the buffet. We will assuredly come back for it some other time. As it stands, the Friday Night Fish Fry is still recommendable, even if for only $1 more you get all you can eat fish, and salad bar. Doh! At least next time well know, and now you do to.

I recommend you just avoid it altogether as I wish I would have done. However, here is the quick synopsis, if you must.For eight bucks you get two frozen cod fillets (at least I assume it was cod) and two frozen potato pancakes. The fish was just awful. The batter was ultra thick and crispy and the fish was mushy and nasty.  It was much worse than the Glass Nickel, who also serves pre-battered frozen fillets, but they dont taste anywhere near this bad. The potato pancakes were almost as bad, but I at least finished both of them. Frozen 2 Fryer = loss.The tartar was also not good as it was comprised of many different things, none of which belong together. And who can possibly ruin a piece of garlic bread? The Mendoata Grill, thats who. There was no coleslaw on the salad bar, but some extremely nasty potato salad to make up for it. Yeesh. Another loss.To top off this debacle they cram a 24oz fountain soda in there which is probably the only decent thing about the meal, especially when you consider it took almost 15 minutes to get this gruel. Overall, this Fish Fry is not recommendable in any way. At the Mendota Grill for your $8 you get: two frozen fish fillets, two frozen potato pancakes, grody tartar, an uninspired piece of garlic bread, a weak salad bar, and a huge soda; versus, three or more hand battered cod fillets, fresh cooked fries, delicious tartar, an abundant side of slaw, a fountain soda, and fresh toasted garlic bread for only $6.50 at the Regent Street Retreat. It seems pretty obvious to me never again will we be tempted by anything at the Memorial Union, never again.www.union.wisc.edu/food/mendotagrill.html800 Langdon StreetMadison, WI 53706     (608) 265-3000",1866,-0.07615740740740738,0.6523148148148148

It is funny how often that old adage seems to hold. Regardless of the task, it sometimes takes a couple failed endeavors to help us figure out how to get something right.  Well, after two subpar visits, at Picasso's original location, weve finally had a Fish Fry there that we feel confident in recommending.  I was actually very hesitant to try Picasso's again based on my two previous encounters, but since I was eating with two non-Fish Fry folks I had to be the bigger man and compromise. We arrived at their Madison/Fitchburg location around 7:30, and waited a curious 10 minutes or so at the front counter/makeshift bar while the host bussed us a spot. Once he finally returned he led us to our behemoth booth, only to leave us there with some menus and the promise that a waitress would be right over. She arrived a little more than 5 minutes later, and we wasted no time hitting her up with our orders  a veggie pizza for the little lady, chicken parm for her cousin, the house favorite walleye for me, and a couple of Spotted Cows for us gents.She bolted away to drop the orders by the kitchen and came back with our beverages lickety-split. I quickly downed my Cow, and waited for her to promptly come back with the fish, but it was nowhere to be found. It would have been nice if she would have at least come back so I could have gotten another beer before dinner, but alas, that was also not in the cards. The food finally appeared around 20 minutes later, and thankfully, was nice and hot all around. I was famished by this point and tore into the walleye with reckless abandon.The $13 walleye is served classic style, in one long fillet. I tend to prefer mine to be broken up into smaller chunks to increase the fish/batter ratio, but I really cant complain about this stuff. It was definitely high quality fish with a nice flaky texture. It was adorned with a light, golden-colored batter that was reminiscent of the Spotted Cow beer battered on their cod. There was no claim of the bovine infused ingredient on the menu, so I have to assume it was different, but whatever it was, the neutral flavor of the batter allowed the fish to shine through. As you would expect with walleye there were a few tiny bones left in the meat, but MFF aint no wuss, and can handle that sorta thing.While the walleye was an inspired piece of work, the artists masterpiece may well have been his French fries. While Cousin Garrett referred to them as steak fries Im not sure I would classify them as such. What I would say is that they were perfectly fried and looked like the idyllic McDonalds fry, only a bit thicker, a lot crispier, and even a tad tastier. While these fries were clearly a seminal piece of art, the tartar sauce on the other hand must have come from the artists Blue Period.Picassos tartar was acceptable, but it was a little queer, to be frank. While it housed no dill (which was a relief), very little, if any, relish was present either. What was there was a thin-ish mix with a weird hint of something on the backend that I attribute to lemon zest, but cant be sure about. It was somewhat usable, but far from Guernica. Trolling alongside the adequate portion of fish and fries was a wee piece of garlic toast that seemed to be slightly out of place. It was the same bread came with the chicken parm, and while it tasted fine, it was tiny, and really didnt fit in with the Fish Fry mystique one bit. The slaw on the other hand was fairly traditional. Picassos serves the cool and creamy variety of slaw and it was quite tasty, although the last few bites were swimming in slaw-water - which is a little unappetizing to say the least.Back in our pre-Fish Fry days we enjoyed numerous pizzas from Picassos, so I know for a fact they make a quality pie, and Im glad I can finally say the same for their Fish Fry. My pervious two visits just didnt quite cut the mustard due to the fact I was less than impressed by the beer battered cod, and the rest of the meal was not enough to pull them up from the depths. This time however, the above average walleye helped to bring it all together, and make for a total Fish Fry experience. We still arent blown away by any means, but we are a bit of a sucker for walleye, and when walleye is done well, all is well with in the Fish Fry universe. Odd service aside, this was a pretty good visit to Picassos. Overall, I feel fine about recommending their walleye and will probably be back to check out some of the artists other works eventually. After all, when you live with a vegetarian sometimes you have to make concessions, and, at the least, Picassos work pleases a diverse audience. www.picassosonline.com/5266 Williamsburg WayFitchburg, WI 53719     (608) 271-8440",4783,0.04765747299838209,0.5014301747635083

There are so many Fish Frys available in and around Madison that it can be downright impossible to sample them all. It certainly doesn't help that many places go under, and new places open up in their stead, often times under different ownership and with different staffs, including cooks. Well, Buck's Madison Square Garden on Regent recently went through a change in ownership, and is now called Buckingham's (real unique, I know). Along with the slightly modified moniker came a modified menu, including an AYCE Friday Night Fish Fry. Since I had some business to attend to downtown later in the evening (drinking beer at Brocach), I figured we might as well head down that way a little early and give Buckingham's their chance at Fish Fry immortality. Gabe and I sauntered into Buckingham's around 8pm and were not the least bit surprised to find very few people eating, but plenty of folks drinking - Buck's is/was that kind of place. We pulled a couple stools close to the bar and ordered a pitcher of Cow and a couple of the AYCEs as soon as the barkeep came by. The Cow was just lovely, and no more than 10 minutes into our pitcher, the fish came. The cook brought it fresh from the kitchen and at first glance it appeared to be served family style. No problem, I thought, it is AYCE after all so I guess family style makes sense. It turned out that the mass of fish and fries were just for me, and Gabe's own heaping plate was on its way. After a quick examination of the situation it was clear that the tiny cup of tartar provided would be no match for this much fish, so I immediately requested a spare - to which she brought three.My mantra states that fish must not sit, so I immediately grabbed up one of the three gargantuan pieces and went for it. The cod was incredibly thick and adorned with a spicy looking beer batter. The taste was somewhat of a mixed bag. It was rich and creamy, but had some overly fried parts which were less than desirable. Surprisingly, the spicy looking batter didn't actually have a lot of flavor, and since it was so thick it trapped a fair amount of grease between itself and cod. On the whole it was decent, but by the time I managed to get to the third piece it had too much time to sit and was sopping wet with grease. It would have been much better if they had started with two fillets, and then brought more if/when I asked for it. As it stood, there was no way I could eat anymore than the first portion which is disappointing at an AYCE, especially since if it was nice and hot I might have been able to put that third chunk down.Somewhere amongst the fry-pile were the thick cut beer fries. They were plentiful, well fried, and really a step above the fish. No complaints here. The tartar was also exemplary, and improved the thick, greasy cuts of cod dramatically. The zesty sauce, with its thick mayo base was up to the task and went round for round with the fish until I could not eat any more. In the end it was the tartar that saved the day for this Fish Fry.With so much fish around it can be hard to focus any on the sides, and Buckingham's seems to have fallen victim to their own lavishness. The dinner roll that accompanied the meal was incredibly dense and was really not tasty, save for the copious amount of whipped butter that came with it. While the roll didn't do it for me, the slaw had a bit of horseradish kick that made it more tolerable. It appears that Buckingham's is still riding the coattails of its predecessor as the old Buck's signs remain on the outside of the building. At this point I think they need to do more to set themselves apart from their old-self. They are clearly trying to do some things differently, including the Friday Fish Fry, but as of now it still seems like Buck's (which was a great place to drink before and during Badger football games, but not much on the food front). Overall, I would probably not recommend the Fish Fry, since the actual fish was decent, but not great. Sure, the fries and tartar were great, but the focus of a Fish Fry is the fish. Even though Buckingham's is new to the game I can't quite give them the benefit of the doubt here. They really need to step their game up and figure out the subtle nuances of the AYCE Fish Fry. AYCE isn't just about slapping a ton of fried stuff on a plate; there is a portioning-and-refill methodology that they need to master if they want to do it right - hopefully they learn it soon. buckinghamsmadison.com/index.html802 Regent StreetMadison, WI 53715     (608) 251-4744",4607,0.10419897903768874,0.4736452854194789

I was a tiny bit disappointed, but figured a long weekend in Chicago would erase that feeling soon enough. We hit the road just after the noon hour, bound for the skyscrapers and traffic snarls of the Windy City. We didnt eat much before we left and as we drove down I-90 our crew started to get that hungry feeling. Being that I still wanted fish, and well knowing that finding a small local place serving Fish Fry for lunch would be damn near impossible, I resigned myself to finding a Culvers and giving their cod another shot.  We pulled into the Worlds Largest Culvers outside of Edgerton and B lined to the counter. The fish dinner at Culvers comes in a 2-piece or 3-piece for around $9 or $11 respectively. Since it was lunch time I went for the 2-piece and grabbed myself a water to drink. The rest of the crew opted for burgers or sandwiches and even though they ordered after I did, had their food in hand well ahead of mine. It took a good 10 minutes for the fish to appear, but it was nice and hot, and freshly fried when it did - I was pretty impressed actually. The cod was surprisingly good. The fish was really flaky and moist, and cloaked in a thick batter which was actually tasty as well. I fully expected them to be pre-battered, frozen fillets, but these clearly were not. The tartar was also surprisingly good. It was a nice thick mayo blend with a fair amount of relish. I expected some Kraft-like concoction, but this stuff looked homemade and tasted far better that its generic counterpart.Culvers fries are Culvers fries and while they arent perfect, the thick cut crinkle jobs do what they need to do. A hefty dose of salt made them more than edible and I really cant complain since I have eaten them on numerous burger runs in the past. I think they are fine, and if they go great with a burger they gotta go great with a Fish Fry, right? The slaw and the bread that accompanied the meal were also better than expected. The roll was soft and fairly fresh while the slaw was actually really decent and served in a huge cup that I only made it about half way through. Overall, I was incredibly impressed by this trip to Culvers especially based on my previous fish related experience there. Basically I went in not expecting much, and Culvers more than blew those expectations out of the water. The fish was really decent as was the tartar sauce. The fries are what you expect from Culvers, and they seem to working for them so I gotta give them credit there too. When you take into consideration that the roll and slaw are both perfectly respectable you get a full meal for a fair price. I guess I have no choice but to give them the Madison Fish Fry seal of approval. Hell, Id go back in a pinch and would have no qualms about telling someone else to do the same.

Hayden Fox was the Coach of this squad and his show brought its 90s style of humor into our living rooms on a weekly basis. Eventually the program ran its course and gave way to other, less football related, TV shows. Luckily for fans of all thing coaching related, a new bar and grill has opened in Cross Plains, in the space once occupied by PJ Muellers. Back in our pre-Fish Fry review days, MFF visited PJs and was not really impressed; therefore we werent all that surprised when the place closed its doors. Fortunately for us, and the citizens of The Plains, the place wasnt closed forever, and recently reopened as Coachs Club: Sports Bar and Steakhouse. On any given Friday the area surrounding Coachs Club and The Monks Retreat is a hub of activity. Vehicles overflow the tiny parking lots and are forced into whatever open space happens to be on the street or in the neighboring business lots. We somehow finagled a spot across the road and made the short jaunt to the restaurant around 7:30 PM. We were greeted by a friendly bartender who pointed us towards the hostess station after we grabbed a drink, and inquired about a table. As soon as the hostess returned to her roost she ushered us to an open spot on the upper level of the restaurant. Our waiter (who was reminiscent of a slightly younger Luther Van Dam) came by a few minutes later, dropped some water, and told us that the cod was sold out.  Really? The cod was sold out before 8 PM on Friday night? Not good, I thought. Luckily (for them) I was here for some freshwater fish action and the lack of cod played not into my decision, although it was a bit alarming, and clearly noted. If you want cod, you should apparently get to Coachs really early.When Luther came back a few minutes later I put in for one $15 plate of bluegill while the little lady concocted a specialty veggie sandwich which was not on the menu, but do-able according to Luth. 10-15 minutes later our plates appeared and were hot, but not scalding, as I presume Luthers general sluggishness prevented a timely delivery. As soon as I could get my hands on one of the 11 bluegill fillets I seized the opportunity and went to town. The fish looked great and had a delicious flavor to match. The batter was nice and light and complimented the slightly fishy bluegill perfectly. Much like the Coachs girl Christine, it was the total package. Not only did it look appealing, but its beauty went beyond its exterior and revealed a true down to earth goodness. Great fish all around.Haydens secondary sidekick, Dauber, was a heck of a nice fella, but was definitely a few bricks shy of a load. The Clubs waffle fries were somewhat reminiscent of his youthful ignorance and while they tasted just fine, they were lukewarm when they came and in a very small portion. I ate them all, but how could I not? There were hardly any of them and I ran out way before I exhausted my 11 fish fillets. Like Daub, those that were present had a simple, genuine goodness even if they werent plentiful.If there is one thing Hayden Fox knew how to do it was coach em up. He got his kids ready for every game and I think he would have been more than pleased with his team if it performed as well as the tartar did. This was definitely a saucy sauce. It was comprised mostly of mayo, but had enough relish, to keep it interesting. When combined with what appeared to be a hint of pimiento, the tartar made its case for player of the game by improving each and every bite of the bluegill. In the end, the fish was the star of the show, and took home the MVP honors, but the tartar was clutch. When Luther initially dropped our food I noticed that my plate was lacking a certain semolina (and somethingerother) bread. I immediately inquired as to where it was (it was listed on the menu) and he trotted off to retrieve it. As it turns out, I am glad I said something because the homemade-looking bread was warm and tasty. I would likely have given it an excellent if it had come straight away, but since I had to remind them I have to dial it down a notch and give them a good. I think this is more than generous due to the fact that if I would have gotten stiffed their score would have suffered even more. One of the more interesting ancillary characters on Coach was Haydens daughter Kelly. She was a sweet girl who didnt share her fathers passion, but had many interests all her own. Coachs coleslaw apparently took a few lessons from her. It was clearly homemade and boasted a lovely apple cider vinegar taste. It was cool and sweet and had just enough flavor to keep you coming back for more. While it wasnt a traditional Fish Fry slaw, it really worked well, much like the dynamic between the TV father and daughter. Coach enjoyed a long run of nine great seasons and I see comparable longevity in Cross Plains similarly named establishment. The Fish Fry was really good and I have no problem recommending it, even at $15. The portion of bluegill was enough to make up for the fairly high price, even if the fries were somewhat lacking. The tasty tartar added a lot to the meal and the extras all played their parts perfectly. In addition, the place is practically brand new and has a real nice low-end steakhouse look and feel to it. Maybe the best thing about Coach is that it will live forever in reruns, and it makes me think that it wont be too long before we give the Fish Fry at Coachs Club a rerun of its own. Next time maybe Ill try the cod? I havent caught that episode, yetwww.coachsclub.com1200 Main StreetCross Plains, WI 53528     (608) 413-0400",5744,0.16688332387102878,0.4658506020391266

The Tory Miller hot spot has been around long enough now to have shed some less heralded items, tightening their menu into nothing but crowd-pleasing dishes. There are no superfluous entrÃ©es here at present, with the best part being the inclusion of an honest to goodness Fish Fry...EVERY. SINGLE. FRIDAY.Of course, since it's a Miller, there is going to be some flexibility when it comes to the specials and on Friday there is a rotating cast of characters. This week the fish du jour was catfish which is about as hit-and-miss as a Fish Fry fish can be. We've had cornmeal crusted, superbly seasoned catfish that was as savory as any fish you'll find, but we've also has sloppy, less-than-firm catfish that brought the term ""bottom-feeder"" to the forefront of our minds. The Graze rendition fell into the prior tier and was simply done right. Three meaty pieces made up $18 portion, and were home to a light breading that didn't appear to be any sort of beer batter (they quote beer batter on the menu). While catfish does have a tendency to be mushy this was about as clean and flaky as you'll ever find. There were no brown or slimy parts (which means it was well-trimmed) and it held together remarkably well. We absolutely loved it and think it's undoubtedly some of the best catfish we've had...FROM. THE. BOTTOM. TO. THE. TOP. You're not going to see bags full of pre-cut fries in Graze's freezer and for good reason. Their fresh-cut fries are the bee's knees and there were plenty to go around. These spuds were perfectly fried, adequately salted and taken over the top by the horseradish aioli. YUM. Speaking of the aioli it had a buddy in the house tartar which was zippy and smooth, and paired admirably with the crisp catfish. Between the fish, fries, and sauces we were mixin' and matchin' and dippin' and dunkin' and loving every minute of the mayhem...FLAVOR. CITY. I'm not really all that surprised, but there was no bread with the Fish Fry, which sucks, but a very good and plentiful cup of house-made slaw sort of made up for it. This blend was smooth and creamy without any overly influential flavors. It had a good balance, but man, we wish we could have scooped a spoonful onto a little slice of rye...PARADISE. LOST. Graze has been a great restaurant since day one, and it speaks volumes to see them continuing to improve. From the double smash burger, to some other recent additions we've heard nothing but good things about the updates. Of course, for us the fact that they've dedicated to the Fish Fry puts them on a whole new level and we're thrilled to have finally made it back to sample something new. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and can hardly wait to see what they have up their sleeve for when we come back next. NEXT. FISH.

Lo and behold, a mere two months later here we were; the reason for our expeditious return being that friends from out of town had infiltrated the city with a strong desire to pay the unfamiliar, but sought-after, downtown dining spot its dues. All told we had a group of nine, and knew a bit of a wait was in store, so a few of us showed up a little early, got our name on the list, and enjoyed a couple cheap High Lifes at the bar. Luckily for our brood, just as everyone in the party showed up, the long table that graces the heart of Graze opened up. We were in like Flynn.The polite and punctual waitress appeared moments after everyone was seated, and relayed the fish special. She left promptly with orders for more drinks, and some of Grazes special vodka battered cheese curds. When she reappeared more instructions were issued, this time in the form of $15 walleye, and $20 hamburgers. She buzzed away to make our desires known, returning shortly after with our bounty of thickly battered curds. The creamy goodness of the curds quickly vanished into the hungry bellies situated around the table, and tamed the savage beasts for a brief moment. Curds conquered, we waited for the walleye which wafted tableward within 15 minutes of its initial inquiry, fresh from the deep fryer. On our previous endeavor at Graze the walleye was stricken with a supremely thick and doughy cornmeal batter which totally sublimated the fish. This time around we were met with a changeup as the walleye was coated in the same vodka based concoction that graced the more than capable curds. We found it to be much more enjoyable, as one could actually taste the fish as it struggled to make its voice heard from under a dense batter sheath. The batter was still the dominant force, but by and large the fish-batter combo worked, even though the fish was definitely the submissive in this relationship. The biggest detractor however was the fact that for your $15 you only get two small, relatively thin pieces of fish which doesnt necessarily complement the Wisconsin appetite, if ya catch my drift. Pairing well with the abundantly battered fish was a non-traditional, but tasty, tartar with a thin ranch-like base. Usually we are not huge fans of the runnier sauces, but this tartar actually worked well with the rich fish, so we wont complain too much. We also cant complain about the phenomenal fries (or frites, if you must) that accompanied the girls to the ball. These pleasant potato partitions were clearly made in-house, and slathered with salt, which I enjoyed, but others found to be a bit much. They were easily some of the best you are going to find in our fair city, and are certainly on par with the likes of The Coopers Tavern, Capital Tap Haus, Buck & Honeys or jacs (we have also heard the frites at Brasserie V are also to die for, but have never had the pleasure of sampling them).Conversely, I found the homemade slaw to be fairly average, but most everyone else really liked it. It was composed of long thin cabbage and carrot slices with a slightly creamy sauce that had a little zest to it. Unfortunately, the slaw was missing its partner in crime and there wasnt any bread to be found, which is a game changer in our book. After a second visit to Graze there were certainly some signs of improvement, but we cant quite give them the full-fledged MFF seal of approval. Overall, the food is good, and clearly of the utmost quality, however, the fish was merely acceptable as the batter was improved, but still left a little something to be desired. In addition, the fact that you dont get much bang for your buck doesnt really help matters. The standout fries were a very welcome addition, and the tartar and slaw did what they could, but in the end this is a case of portion versus price, and at $15 you should really get a little more than what Graze is pandering. While I fully expect to pony up the dough for walleye I also expect to be stuffed when leave, and unfortunately for yours truly, this hasnt been the case at Graze. www.grazepub.com1 South PinckneyMadison, WI 53703     (608) 251-2700",4254,0.11898164084911064,0.49473034997131377

The same goes for notable establishments and their Fish Frys. There are a few places like the Owls Nest and the Dorf House that you just knew had a great Fry before you ever set foot in the door. Then there are other places that you just arent sure what to you are going to get. Case and point: the all-new Graze Pub. Graze has been getting a lot of mixed reviews and when I heard they were offing a Fish Fry on Friday nights I knew I needed to verify the inconsistency for myself. We saddled up the same crew we had last Friday night, and hit the Letoile spinoff around 7:30 bound and determined to see what was what.We arrived to find a bustling crowd and an  hour-plus wait, but being the committed connoisseurs we are, we grabbed some drinks at the crowded bar and stood our ground. A couple $2.50 High Lifes, and 45 minutes later, our steadfastness paid off and we were shown to a corner table with a spectacular view of the Capitol. Things were looking up, at least for the time being.Our waitress came over shortly thereafter and since we had ample time to wait, we were ready for her. We gave her our orders, and she sped off to drop them by the kitchen as she grabbed us another round of drinks on her way through. The Friday Fish Fry at Graze is unique every week, and this time around they were serving a Lake Erie Walleye with a price tag of $15 (actually not too bad for an upscale, downtown establishment, I thought). We enjoyed the view, and each others company for a few more minutes and before too long the food made its grand entrance. As soon as I saw the darkly battered fish I knew I was in for a unique experience, and it most certainly was. I of course, wasted no time and went for one of my two tiny the walleye pieces first. I was immediately struck by the hefty batter, which was incredibly thick and actually reminded me of the coating you find on a corndog. While it wasnt bad per se, it really masked the delicate, flaky fish that housed it, rendering the walleye powerless. I quickly polished off the petite portion regardless of the funkiness of the batter, but mostly because there wasnt much there to polish off.Like the less than copious walleye, the Graze fries were also hard to come by. However, they were clearly homemade and very well fried so all was not lost. A scant amount of tartar flowed in the same vein as fish and fries, and the thin ranch-like mix barely made it through two small pieces of fish.If there is any element of a Fish Fry that I would rather not have in abundance it would have to be coleslaw. Unfortunately for yours truly, a disproportionate amount of their homemade orangey goo found its way onto the plate. Much like the other items in this Fish Fry the slaw really didnt stand out as it lacked any zest, and just didnt keep me coming back for more. To top it all off there was no bread served which seems like it should be a no-brainer, but apparently is not in this day and age. Blech. Cmon Graze If there is one thing Graze has going for it, it is their great service. I guess you kind of come to expect better service at finer dining establishments, but our waitress was on top if it from the get go. She was at our table numerous times and made sure we had everything we needed throughout the entire meal. I chalk it up to the fact that the dining room was well organized and they seem to know how many tables a waitress can actually handle, and still keep customers satisfied. Truly top notch.Overall, this is just not a recommendable Fish Fry as far as Fish Frys go. Granted, Graze is not the kind of place you think of when you think of a great Fish Fry, and it is nice that they are trying to make the Wisconsin tradition a priority, but the walleye just didnt quite cut it. While the batter was unique, it was just a little too much and unfortunately the tartar was not there to lend any support. Good, fries and a mass of slaw are good, but not game changers, and when you take into account the total lack of bread there just isnt enough there to add up. Graze, all I can say is, thanks for trying, unfortunately we just cant give your walleye the MFF seal of approval. www.grazepub.com1 South PinckneyMadison, WI 53703     (608) 251-2700",4274,0.1224311531841652,0.5119181487856187

Sure, Madison has its share of top notch Fish Frys, and we obviously love them, but just because we have come to know and love our city doesnt mean that other places dont have their own great Fish Fry joints to choose from. For once we happened to have plans on a Friday (other than just eating fish), and since we were going to be in Milwaukee anyway we decided that a visit to the Lakefront Brewery made perfect sense. In a few short years, the Palm Garden has become known as one of the best Frys in the Milwaukee area and when you are presented with an opportunity to try an award winner it is your duty to take it, so we did.We showed up at the riverfront establishment just after 6pm and were relieved to see that a line had not yet formed. We strode right up the hostess desk, ran into the folks we were meeting, grabbed a beer, and were shown to our table all within a few minutes. It would prove to be an auspicious beginning to a great meal. The Lakefront Fish Fry is basically a family style affair in that you are supposed to share a table with a bunch of randoms, but since our group was so large we were allotted a table all to ourselves. We sat for a bit and waited for Megan (our waitress according to the placard that decorated the table) to come over. Eventually she did and we were ready for her with dinner orders on the tip of our tongues. Being that they are only open on Friday, you know that Fish Fry is the name of the game, and to that end they played the game well, offering up: cod, lake perch and bluegill for between $10 and $14. Since I had never been to there, and really didnt want to miss out on any of the options I went for the $14 combo platter which housed each of the fish varieties as well as a couple of fried shrimp. The food came about 15 minutes or so after Megan got around to dropping the order by the kitchen and varied in temperature from piece to piece. For starters I tried a piece of the bluegill which had a nice light breading and a good texture but was lukewarm at best. I quickly polished it off and stepped over to the cod, which was more enticing since it was steaming hot. The cod was much better than the cool-gill, as it had a flaky breading with some nice spice over pure white flaky bits of fish. After the drastic improvement from bluegill to cod I was sure the perch would be somewhat of a regression, but I was totally wrong. The singular butterfly of perch was as hot as the cod, but tasted even better. A similar (if not exactly the same) spicy breading complimented the perch perfectly and made for an idyllic taste sensation. The only downfall was that with the combo platter you only receive the one butterfly, which left me longing for more once it was expended. Potato pancakes are a big deal when you see them in the Madison area due to the fact that most places just dont serve them. Well, in Milwaukee it seems to be a bit of a different story and pretty much everywhere has them as the side of choice; the Lakefront is no exception. Unfortunately, like my bluegill, the pancakes tasted really good, but could/should have been much hotter. They were still nice and onion-y and clearly homemade, but unfortunately it seems like they came from a pancake assembly line where they make a bunch at a time then let them sit as they fill orders. I spose this is how you have to do it when you serve this many people, but it still would be nice if they were fresher. One of our non-fish eaters got French fries which were also good, but not excellent. The Julienne cut tubers tasted good, but suffered from not have enough time in the fryer to get nice and crispy.The perfect complement to a great Fish Fry is a great tartar, and Lakefront has it down. The thick, creamy sauce was about as close as perfect as you can get and reminded me so much of Wilsons it was scary. The only drawback to it was the tiny portion, but since the fish portion was also kinda tiny I actually didnt run out, which was a small miracle in and of itself. Putting near-perfect finishing touches on this Fish Fry were a classic homemade slaw, and a classic basket of marble-rye bread (there was also some white bread present, but when you can get your hands on the real stuff, you just gotta go for it). The slaw was incredibly edible as was the traditional bread, their stankiness balanced the spicy breading and onion rich pancakes to a T. Overall, this is simply a great fish fry, and an event the whole family can definitely enjoy. If there is one quibble I have it is that the portion size is less than impressive, but even that is fairly minor when you consider that everything you do get is top notch. After all, this is really what a great Fish Fry is all about - bringing together great food in a great atmosphere with lots of friends and family. Furthermore, the service was quick and friendly, and the Lakefront beer was actually decent (the Wheat Monkey definitely surprised me a little). In addition, there is a live polka band, with plenty of kid friendly tunes and a full-blown dance floor where kids and adults alike can cut loose after filling up on fried fish.

This is true of most things in life and especially true when in comes to Fish Fry. Many places toil for years and never find the magic, while others seemingly strike gold from the get-go. Buck and Honey's applied the Midas touch to their Fry from day one, slinging gilded goodies to the hungry masses of Sun Prairie almost immediately. We lauded the Fry initially, but hadn't gnashed the golden goodness for over four years, and figured it was time to see if this one still had legs. B&H's does a $10.50 2-piece piece for lunch which according to the bill is actually a $9.50 2-piece with an unannounced up-charge of $1.00 for the cheesy hash brown casserole. The pieces of cod were on the frail side coming in at around 3 oz each soaking wet. They were home to a crispy beer batter that let you know it was there, but didn't bring much flavor to the table. It was a pretty standard cod which was flaky but held together by the forceful batter. Unannounced or not, the cheesy hash browns were worth the extra buck...although I'm not sure what would have come otherwise. The casserole was slightly crispy on top with plenty of gooey deliciousness inside. The portion was hearty and helped pick up some of the slack left by the waifish cod.The tartar wasn't the thickest out there but wasn't the thinnest either. It clung when it needed to and added some pop to the presentation, but couldn't really ball with the batter. A delightfully garlicky roll was plush as can be and turned out to be one of the starts of the show. Some fresh looking slaw was incredibly crunchy despite it's creamy base that tried to subvert triumphant texture. Buck & Honey's has been the best Fish Fry in Sun Prairie since its inception and not much has changed. While the Fish Fry doesn't strike us like it once did it is still very good and one we'll continue to keep tabs on.

The new patio at B&Hs (complete with cornhole and horseshoe pits) has relieved some of the pressure on the interior space. When we showed up during primetime this Friday there were spots open at the bar, and even a few open tables. We snagged one of the high-tops right away and were off and running. It was a great start and something we werent mentally prepared for, but were happy to find (we expected a long wait bar-side). There were a waitresses buzzing all over in a well-coordinated ballet of efficiency. They all seemed to be genuinely enjoying their work and it wasnt but a couple minutes before our own joyful server stopped on by. As is the norm at Buck & Honeys she took our order in a flash and delivered it promptly to the kitchen without missing a beat. No more than 10 minutes passed before she returned with a smile on her face and plates in hand. The Fish Fry ($13.50) looked pretty, but as expected, the portion was on the small side. While, in actuality, it was probably an appropriate size, we Wisconsinites have become accustomed to, and have come to expect, more and bigger fish. While I personally dont have a problem with the amount of food I know there are people out there that might. They walleye and lake perch options were also one the expensive side.Regardless of the size, the cod was delicious. It featured a light and flaky breading that enrobed, but didnt drown out, the moist, premium cuts of cod. The breading had a balanced seasoning blend with a cumin undertone that played perfectly with the pure fish. While some grease tried to collect, I made sure to flip them about three minutes in to keep it from settling too much which kept things fairly pristine. The default side with the Fish Fry is a cheesy hash brown casserole, not the standard French fries. The browns were rich and creamy, clearly made with care, and scooped right out of a big pan/casserole dish. They were definitely tasty, but I still kicked myself for not remembering to switch to the house-cut fries. The fries are simply phenomenal. A creamy tartar came on the side, and had the right flavor but could have been a tad thicker. There was noticeable dill present in the homemade sauce, but it wasnt overpowering and didnt taint the fish. The slaw was also homemade, but unlike the tartar, was incredibly creamy. The thick goo was plentiful, but could have used some more zip. A little white roll was perched on the corner of the plate, and was fresh and warm. While its no rye, its not a bad alternative, and probably more popular than the rye so its understandable why they chose to go that route. Rye is traditional, but not necessarily in vogue in 2013. Buck & Honeys is the best thing Sun Prairie has going for it, and it really shows. Its definitely a place the locals can be proud of, and the crown jewel in whatever culinary scene exists in the suburb. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and have lots of good reason to come back time and again. www.buckandhoneys.com804 Liberty RoadSun Prairie, WI 53590     (608) 837-3131",3326,0.24408196875588176,0.49884235732061816

Whether it is the tidy, modern atmosphere, or the expertly mixed cocktails, the place emits a vibe that is sure to be a hit with even the most finicky of patrons. We arrived just after 7PM and put our party of four on the list. Being Friday, B&Hs was bustling, but we found an open area, grabbed some drinks, and took shelter near the bar. Within 20 minutes the hostess summoned our quartette and showed us to our table on the mini-stage in the dining room nearest the bar. She left us with some menus, and a smile. It took about 10 minutes for the waitress to finally make her way over, but it gave us ample time to study the menu (although the Fish Fry options are pretty limited so there wasnt all that much for us to take in). The three fish eaters all went for the $13.50 3-piece cod Fish Fry with the cheesy hash browns, while our lone vegetarian chose whatever it is she did. A couple of us also chose to add soup to our meals, yours truly included.  The clam chowder came in advance of the fish, was clearly made in-house, and tasted very good. It was thick and hearty, and featured a fair amount of clam. I gobbled it down and no sooner had the last bites been polished off than the scalding hot fish arrived. We have come to expect the cod at Buck & Honeys to be some of the best of the best, but this go-round it seemed to have slipped a bit. The three average sized pieces of fish were obviously high quality, and featured the same light breading as always, but it seemed like a little something was missing. Perhaps it was just a bit less spicy than normal? Perhaps the breading was just a little bit thicker? I couldnt quite put my finger on it, but regardless, the fish was flaky and the breading still tasty enough to call it excellent  just not Top 10 excellent. I know for a fact that the home-cut fries at Buck & Honeys are some of the best around, but chose the exceptional cheesy hash browns after being lobbied by the waitress to do so. She was right, the cheesy spuds were pretty exceptional, and made a fine substitute for the homemade fries, but Im not sure they were quite as superb. They had a silky flavor that was mild, but almost too mild, smooth but almost too smooth. As Peter Griffin would say, the side almost insists upon itself - the flavor good, but not incredibly diverse. They were cheesy, but that was the long and short of it. Dont get me wrong, they were still great, but Ill take the flavors found in the home-cut fries any day. The mild fish was little to no match for the tarter that B&Hs trotted out. While the sauce had a very nice consistency it was a bit heavy on the relish which easily overpowered the smooth cod. The slaw somewhat followed in the sauce's steps in that it was tasty, but slightly missed the mark. The creamy concoction almost reminded me of Wilsons slaw of old, and seemed to have some sour cream, or something similar, in it. Luckily, unlike the Wilsons slaw of old, it was salvaged with a hint of zest on the backend which pulled it back from the brink. On our previous visits we lambasted Buck & Honeys for failing to provide any sort of bread with their Fish Fry  a no-no in our book. Well, apparently they took our advice and added some kind of rye to the mix. Well, either the rye wasnt popular, or they were just out of it, but instead of the Fish Fry classic we received one of the little football-shaped white bread loaves. The loaves were just fine, and much better than nothing, but still not the rye Id gotten my hopes up for. All things being equal, this was another great trip to Buck & Honeys, and, as per usual, all in attendance were pleased. On top of the excellent food, the service was punctual and very thorough beyond the opening delay. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry, and will come back whenever were in need of diversity and deliciousness on a Friday night. www.buckandhoneys.com804 Liberty RoadSun Prairie, WI 53590     (608) 837-3131",4073,0.2011467808097022,0.5302086677367577

Certainly, the meal itself is the basis for a get-together, but the people you spend it with are every bit, if not more important than the food you eat. Of course, it is possible to have a great Fish Fry all by your lonesome, but its always better when you have good friends to share the experience with. When my friend Brown said he was going to be in town and wanted to get dinner somewhere near the east side, one place immediately jumped to the front of my fish obsessed mind. We first visited Buck & Honeys not all that long ago, and were thoroughly impressed, save for the lack of bread (well get deeper into that later). Since Sun Prairie is practically near east I figured that the instantly-established establishment was a good bet impress. When Brown rolls into town people seem to come out of the woodwork, and when a few of our other friends told us they were up for a Fry this Friday, I knew I had a treat in store for them as well. We agreed that 7:30 would be a good time to partake in the frying of fish, and called Buck & Honeys to make a reservation (unlike most places, B&H will actually take a reservation on Fridays if you have a big enough party  total bonus). The Mrs. and I rolled in a little early to anchor our party, which we did successfully, procuring a couple stools at the crowded bar and a general area around them. No sooner had one of the wonderful bartenders placed a honey martini and a Spotted Cow in our hands than we caught a glimpse of greatness. No, it wasnt Buck & Honeys Fish Fry that snagged our gaze, but none other than a true Wisconsin icon Barry Alvarez himself. We sat in the ADs company for about five minutes when suddenly the hostess came calling, our name the one that passed her lips. It was only 7:20 and the rest of our party had not yet arrived so our premature summoning was less than ideal. We diverted the hostess, and eventually, at exactly 7:30, the last of our clique rolled in. Unfortunately, by this point our table had been given away in the shuffle, possibly to Mr. Barry Alvarez & friends (at least thats what Im telling myself) who disappeared shortly after we were beckoned. We were resigned to waiting for a bit, which at Buck & Honeys wasnt really that big of a deal. The intermission passed quickly, and another table opened up for us in about 10 minutes. The hostess escorted our party of seven to the Bird Room, gave us some menus, and pranced away leaving us to our devices. A few moments later our waitress arrived, and immediately started jotting down order after order of Fish Fry. Out of our seven diners, four went for the standard cod Fish Fry, one for the baked cod, one for the $21 walleye, and one for a veggie entree. Anticipating split checks would be necessary our savvy server kept each order separate and tacked on additional drinks as necessary  well played.About 15 minutes passed from the moment our waitress left, until the food made its way back to us. The fried fish came first, and I did what I could to restrain myself from diving in until everyone at the table had a similar setting in front of them. This attempt at restriction met with minimal success as I could not help but pop a fry or two. Once I did get my hands on the cod, the phenomenal fish did not last long. The unblemished cod was pure white, incredibly flaky, and clearly well-trimmed. It was partnered with a superb batter, which was a little spicy and incredibly delicious. The mild batter blended effortlessly with the smooth cod, creating a near-perfect flavor combo. Even though you only get two pieces they are larger than average, and equated to roughly a Wilsons 3-piece worth of meat. This portion was a bit on the small side, and left me longing for another piece (or two) once I destroyed what I had. The $12 2-piece comes with a vast amount of potato options and this Friday B&H was pushing the hash browns. Unfortunately, no matter how good they claimed the shreds to be, there was simply no way I was going to order them, what, with Bucks home-cut fries on the chopping block as well. Perhaps I should have branched out and tried the shredded spuds, but I am a fry-guy. Luckily, I was allotted a taste from someone who gave in to the pressure and they were very good, however, I still feel I made the right choice as the French fries were well salted, and literally as close to perfection as you are going get. Mi amor. The small cup of tartar that joined the dance was also right on the money, and the waitress had no problem wrangling up a couple extras for those at the table that desired it. Often times you would find yours truly in that group, but I knew that Id have no problem making my cup last through the two flaky fillets of fish. Whats more, the cod was so well done that it didnt really even need the sauce, which is extremely rare to see, and speaks to the majesty that is the B&H Fish Fry.Capping of the meal was another homemade goody, this time in the form of coleslaw. This creamy concoction boasted a near perfect blend of cabbage and mayo which resulted in an outstanding mixture. Likewise, the ginger slaw, which we were allowed to substitute if requested, had a flavor all its own and was no less delicious. Keep in mind this coming from a man who loathes ginger. Now, you can call me an asshole, or tell me to shove it if you must, but there is an unwritten rule that Fish Fry is to come with some sort of bread - it is just the fact of the matter. While traditionally it would be salted rye, I will take just about anything. What I wont accept is absolutely nothing, which, unfortunately, is what Buck & Honeys is giving you  nada. Is this Fish Fry still recommendable without bread? Sure. Would they be flirting with the Top 10 status with a simple white roll? I think they would just sayin. As we were finishing up pretty much everyone remarked about their various dishes, and how great each one was. All the Fish Fry eaters indicated that it was easily some of the best cod they had ever eaten, while Katie agreed that the baked cod (which comes with a special sauce, in lieu of drawn butter) was superb as well. The lovely Mrs. Hanewicz allowed me to try her pan-fried walleye, and it was outstanding. It basically melted in your mouth (as our waitress claimed it would), but I wouldnt call it a Fish Fry per se. True, it was fried, but it was drizzled with the same sauce as the baked cod, and not very plentiful. The single small fillet was great, but at $21, I dont think I could justify ordering it.  You know you are doing something right when you get local celebrities like Barry Alvarez in your establishment, and whats good for Barry & Friends, is good for MFF & Friends. Overall, this is a great Fish Fry, and one we will come back to time and again. The cod is above reproach, the fries are some of the best weve ever had, and the tartar is the keystone that holds it all together - the Holy Trinity of Fish Fry is well represented by Buck & Honeys. The killer coleslaw rounds out the meal as well as it can, but the lack of bread really does leave a hole that is impossible to fill without some sort of starch. There is no doubt that Buck & Honeys is putting out a great Fish Fry, and one that you simply have to try for yourself. Bread or not, they just get the job done, and that is really all there is to it. www.buckandhoneys.com804 Liberty RoadSun Prairie, WI 53590     (608) 837-3131",7483,0.2208399470899471,0.5070845358345356

There really arent a whole lot of great ones around there, and even those that were decent seem to have hit the skids. This lack of talent has basically led to us overlooking the suburb to the east, and focusing our fish finding energy elsewhere. When we received a tip that a new joint had opened to much acclaim we were intrigued to say the least. When we looked at their menu online and saw the plethora of veggie friendly options the deal was sealed. We bid the hustle and bustle of downtown adieu, and went to get a taste of sweetness at Buck & Honeys. We arrived at the unsullied Sun Prairie hot spot around 7:30, and found ourselves deep in the heart of the Friday night rush. For being the new kid in town, B&H certainly wasnt lacking patronage. An overly kind gent eagerly offered up his barstool to my crutch-laden wife, which allowed us a shot at ordering drinks. I, of course, grabbed myself a Cow while my injury riddled better-half opted for the honey martini (fittingly enough). We sipped our drinks, shot the sh*t with one of the friendly barkeeps, and well within our half-hour quoted wait were seated.Our high-top table was just a stones throw from the bar, and as soon as our talkative waiter saw we were seated he buzzed right over. As per usual, our wait at the bar allowed us plenty of time to reacquaint ourselves with the menu and make our selections, so when waiter Joe came by we were ready for him. The girls chose non-fish related items (you arent here to hear about those, although they were quite good), while I opted for the $12 Fish Fry, over the $21 walleye, which was also on special. The food was ready in short order, and we wasted no time digging in once we got our hands on it.As soon as the first bite of my 3-piece hit my lips I was transported to a fried wonderland. I took another bite, then another, and then another; before I knew what was what two of my three pieces were gone, leaving me to wonder what happened. Apparently when fish is this good, I get lost in its succulence, thats what. The beer batter was simply divine. It was light, but clung to the fish well while at the same time being completely devoid of any grease. Its partner in crime was also superb, as the actual cod was flaky and tender, and fell apart when desired but held firm when it should have. Pairing perfectly with the fish was a house made tartar which was also nothing less than exemplarily. It was creamy and rich, and seemingly cut from the same cloth as our beloved Wilsons tartar. It elevated the cod above the mortal plane and into a true state of nirvana. Needless to say MFF was one happy camper.Of course, no Fish Fry is complete without the perfect side of fried potatoes, and we have to say that B&H is now the lone claimant to the French fry throne. These fantastic fries were clearly homemade, cooked to perfection, and absolutely delicious. In the past we have claimed Hubs fries (of Vernon Country Fair fame) as the pinnacle of fry-dom, but we have finally found a challenger to that title. Why every place doesnt attempt to make fries in this same manner is beyond me, but thankfully someone has finally figured it out. The only problem with their lusciousness was the fact that the grabby hands of my co-diners severely limited my supply, which wasnt all that massive to begin with. More, pleaseIn our eyes a Fish Fry just isnt a Fish Fry without some sort of bread. Rye, wheat, white, roll, slice, loaf, whatever, we welcome all comers and dont draw a harsh line in the sand, but do expect some sort of leavened dough. Unfortunately, a chink appeared in B&Hs armor when it came to offering the simple starch and nothing accompanied the holy trinity of: cod, fries and tartar. It is too bad really, as that simple oversight cost this Fish Fry a chance at immortality. While it is still highly recommendable, without some sort of bread, their chances at making it to the top are severely hindered without the staple. An attempt to save face came in the form of a heap of coleslaw, and while the creamy concoction was good (as far as slaw goes) even the best slaw cant make up for the complete absence of some sort of bread. Overall, this Fish Fry is highly recommendable even with a critical component lacking. Had they served up a simple slice of rye they would be flirting with a top 20 status, but as it stands, their score falls just short. Fantastic fish, tremendous tartar, and phenomenal fries really laid the groundwork to what we can say is easily the best Fish Fry in Sun Prairie, and one that is destined to be one of the best in the Madison area. Top it all off with friendly, (overly) attentive service, fantastic drinks (the honey martini was spectacular), and a marvelous atmosphere, and it is clear why they are toast of the town. Buck & Honeys was just the taste of sweetness Sun Prairie needed. We will be back to sup their saccharine nectar again soon, you can bet on that.www.buckandhoneys.com804 Liberty RoadSun Prairie, WI 53590     (608) 837-3131",5090,0.2319512875440711,0.5181865042174317

I want to like the place, I want to like the service, and I want to like the food, but I guess some things just arent meant to be. I dont know what it is about the South Bay, but it just doesnt seem to work for me no matter how much Id like it to.I want to like the place. Truth be told, I actually think its a pretty nice place, although the parking lot is always packed and the cars in it never seem to move. The adjacent street serves as overflow, but it can barely handle the volume. The place itself feels more like a diner than a bar, but its pretty clean and well-lit so I at least feel like in going to leave unscathed. I also seem to have a habit of arriving at high-tide which perhaps gives the illusion that the place is much busier than it actually is. I want to like the service.  Even though it was busy I got a spot at the bar after being directed to it by the friendly waitress  it would become my cell. It took me a good five minutes but I eventually managed to hail Dave down from my corner roost and put in my order for fish. I know he took the order at that time, but Ill be damned if I know what he did with it. I really want to like the service.  As I waited for my fish I had a beer (Dave was good about re-filling those), and another, and another. Eventually it had been about 40 minutes, the crowd was thinning out, and the cooks were starting to clean things up since they didnt have any orders coming in. At this point Dave came back and asked what I had ordered. I was clearly forgotten, and while I saw them scramble to get it ready it took a total of 45 minutes before I had my fish. I was starving.I want to like the food.  Everything on the South Bays Friday Fish list is beer battered. Yes, EVRYTHING. While beer batter works well on cod or haddock, it just isnt the same on the freshwater fin-sters, and the flavor of the thick batters masks the subtleties of the delicate fish. Last trip I had cod, and it worked fine, this time I tried the bluegill, annnnnd not so much. The batter dominated the mild fish to the point where you couldnt even taste the flaky meat. The batter also had a smoky taste which led me to believe the fryer grease was none too fresh. I really want to like the food. Besides the fish, everything else was a little quirky too. The fries (they were battered if you couldnt guess) were plentiful, but had the same burned taste as the fish. The slaw was tasty, but soupy on the bottom, and there was no bread - which I take issue with. The only item that wasnt weird was the thick tartar which mercifully masked some of the imperfections in the fish. In a vacuum this Fish Fry might be recommendable. In reality, this wasnt a favorable experience. While the food itself was fine, it wasnt good enough to overshadow everything else and at this point I doubt Ill be back. In the end, no one cared whether I was there or not, least of all me. www.davessouthbaybar.com/5404 Raywood RoadMadison, WI 53713     (608) 222-6382",3044,0.13235479797979802,0.4497474747474746

People are skeptical by nature, and when we get information from an unknown source it can be hard to know exactly what to make of it. We at MFF hope that our hundreds of Fish Fry reviews lend us some credibility, and that you actually can take our word for it, but opinions are everywhere and many of them come from less reputable sources. We were recently told that we should try Daves South Bay Lounge & Grill, and since I didnt know much about the Southside establishment I figured Id do some research. Some of what I found was interesting, to say the least.A Google search for Daves South Bay will eventually land you on their entry at Menu Pix. Menu Pix is pretty a cool site, and serves as a useful resource if you have never been somewhere before and want to see what they have to offer. In addition to pictures of menus, people have the ability to review the establishment, and add comments to support their review if they so desire. One such poster did desire apparently, and posted the following: NOT FRIENDLY TO WHITE PEOPLE I DO NOT RECOMMEND on Daves page. Good grief, I thought. I am all for freedom of speech, but this is ridiculous and really unnecessary even if you perceive it to be true. After reading a comment like that I knew I couldnt simply take that persons word for it, and decided to find out what was what for myself. I arrived at South Bay around 5:30 figuring Id be among the first diners of the evening  this turned out to be a slight miscalculation on my part. Daves parking lot was packed, and the street options were not much better. I somehow finagled a spot on the crowded street, wormed past the smokers near the front door, and made my way to one of the few open bar stools once inside. Since I was fishin solo, I wasted no time when Dave came over and gave him my full order. I passed on the walleye, bluegill and lake perch (at $11 a pop), instead opting for the $9 beer battered cod (which Dave claimed to be the most popular of the bunch). One Spotted Cow and 20 minutes later, he served it up, fresh from the fryer and as hot as can be. The plate was piled high with a plethora a fried foods, led by a quartet of cod. The four substantial pieces held rank over the plate as their sheer volume dominated all comers. Even the bevy of fries was powerless against the awesomeness of the cod. Each piece was shrouded in Daves beer batter, which didnt house a wealth of flavor, but was very well fried and not too thick. Good cod is usually greaseless and flaky, and while this cod lacked grease it also lacked texture. While it wasnt mushy, I wouldnt necessarily say it was flaky either; it was actually somewhere in between, but still yielded positive results when combined with the batter. Doing the best they could to stack up to the cod was the generous pile of crispy matchstick fries. They fought long and they fought hard, but truth be told, could not stand up to the mighty portion of fish. They ran short somewhere around the third piece, but their effort and deliciousness will not be forgotten. The tartar also gave its all, but the Wilsons-looking blend could not tame the cod beast. While I did exhaust the full cup it was more a function of the amount of cod, than the delectability of the sauce. Although this South Bay sauce appeared to be a Wilsons clone, the taste told quite a different story. Its thick mayo base gave way to an odd relish twinge that simply overpowered the mix with an almost Kraft-like essence. A side of slaw, and a hamburger bun-looking roll completed the meal, which at $9 turns out to be a heck of a value. Both the coleslaw and roll were appreciated, but quite average; at the least they upheld the Fish Fry ideals. Overall, I feel very confident recommending this Fish Fry, and look forward to coming back to try some of Daves other beer battered options. The fish, fries and tartar were all acceptable, while the slaw and bun did what they needed to do to complete the meal. As for as the anonymous claim that Daves is not friendly the white people, I think we can dispel that rumor seeing as how 90% of the clientele was white, and they all seemed to be having a good old time whooping it up at South Bay. Dave turned out to be a nice guy and the kind of attentive owner who knows most of his patrons by name and takes pride in his establishment. He could have cared less whether you were white, black, yellow, or purple for that matter; all he was trying to do was satisfy his customers, and he definitely succeeded at that. When it comes to online reviews it can be difficult to know who to believe, but in this case you can take my word for it; Daves South Bay does Fish Fry right. www.davessouthbaybar.com/5404 Raywood RoadMadison, WI 53713     (608) 222-6382",4834,0.05909800384800386,0.4437272727272728

It had all the makings of a classic: the all-things-Wisconsin inspired menu, a modern yet traditional feeling atmosphere, and beer as far as the eye could see. It seemed they simply couldnt fail when it came to Fish Fry, but somehow they did.At least initially, their only offering was beer battered haddock which is served every day of the week with nothing added Friday (besides presumably more orders hitting the kitchen). It was a bland rendition to say the least and in classic beer place fashion the batter was way over the top. As time has passed the Tap Haus has evolved and while Haddock is still offered every day it is now joined on Fridays by walleye and lake perch (although this Friday Tilapia was standing in for the perch). Since we were still wary of the haddock, and wanted to see what they could do with walleye we went that route instead. As per usual, the walleye wasnt cheap, but even at $15 is pretty much par for the course. It came alarmingly fast (seriously alarmingly, like 3 minutes after we ordered), and was scalding hot which necessitated picking a few fries out from underneath first to let it cool. It was basically one large, triangular-shaped fillet with the substantial batter we expected. While the fish had the classic walleye flavor all that goodness was essentially smothered under the thick beer batter cocoon. The underside (skin side) even had a crunchy dual layer of batter that needed to be pulled off to make it more manageable. While that all sounds very negative it actually wasnt a total loss, as the fillet was thick enough to balance out the copious coating to some extent. But of course, there is a lot of great walleye to be had in and around Madison and this one is simply not a fine as some of the others out there. Perhaps the place where the Cap Tap can hang its hat is on their house-cut fries. The skin-on spuds are nearly perfect and had us wishing there were more to be had once we polished them off well in advance of the fish. Props to these potatoes. The tartar was good too and really helped to make the brawny fillet much more palatable. It was thick and creamy (as it needed to be) with just enough pop to pacify with the fish. Since no bread comes with the Fish Fry a house-made coleslaw was all that was left to finish things off and it was creamy yet light, but somehow missed the sweet spot. While wed say the Capital Tap Haus has improved over the years we think there is still room for growth. The walleye was hearty and its nice to see the expanded Friday offerings (even if the perch was absent this Friday), but were still far from blown away.

That is to say, these brothers in arms are best enjoyed in tandem, and while they are still perfectly acceptable when separated, their succulence is elevated when the two come together. Fish Fry and beer reviewers are much the same way. After making our desire to visit the all-new Capital Tap Haus known publicly we received a message from the good folks at the Madison Beer Review inquiring as to whether we would like to join them as they made their own maiden journey to the State Street speakeasy. Being the consummate professionals we are we took them up on it, and Fish Fry and beer joined forces for the benefit of mankind once more. We planned to meet at 7pm, and when our sect of the MFF contingent showed up at about 10 minutes late, we found that Jer was already present, and hitting it off with the happy hoppy trio from MBR. We wedged in near them at the end of the crowed bar, and did our best to avoid the wait staff as they brushed our backs on their way to and from the kitchen. We grabbed some drinks (see the MBR review for more info on the Capital Brewery-centric selection), and waited the hour or so for the only table large enough to seat our group to open up. Eventually it did, and we all sat down eagerly hoping that steaming plates of fish would be in front of us in no time flat. It turned out these notions were premature at best. Our orders were fairly straight forward for a Friday night. Most everyone opted for the Fish Fry (which is served daily, by the way), and we threw a few appetizers in there because if anything compliments fish and beer its fried cheese. Unfortunately for us, these appetizers never satisfied our cravings due to the fact that they never actually arrived, which was totally unacceptable to all involved. The fish also kept us in suspense, and didnt emerge for almost an hour after the orders went in. By this point it was around 9:15 and I would have eaten a rancid octopus if it was battered and deep-fried, so when the fish came I pounced on it. Unfortunately, even though I wasted no time digging in, the single sizeable haddock fillet was not steaming hot when served. The lukewarm fish housed a light batter, which lacked any discernable taste and simply couldnt help the slightly slimy haddock it sheltered. All at the table seemed to agree that they likely tried to fry too many pieces at once, reducing the temperature of the fryer oil in the process, and leading to the undercooking. Pairing with the floppy fish was a dynamically delicious tartar, which actually made the disappointing haddock palatable. This stellar sauce was thick and creamy, with a spot-on mayo:relish ratio. The only problem I had with it was little cup it was served in, that while decorative, made it damn near impossible to fully exhaust. Like the fish, not all the fries were freshly fried when they hit the table, which detracted from their luster. However, these homemade ditties were tasty enough to overcome that failing and rally the meal somewhat. Regrettably, killing this rally almost instantly was the lack of bread, and my god, when your dropping 13 bones on a single chunk of haddock a piece of rye doesnt seem like too much to ask. Putting the finishing touches on the meal was the Cap Tap coleslaw which was clearly homemade and simply delicious. While it in no way salvaged the meal it at least alluded to better things on a possible re-visit on a non-Friday. Overall, there is simply no way I can recommend this Fish Fry. The fish looked like it had a lot of potential, but our portions didnt come close to living up to it. Good fries and a tasty slaw did offer a glimmer of hope, and maybe someday their memory will be strong enough to coax us back in the door, but as for this Friday there were just too many shortcomings. The fact we had a large party at a place un-equipped to handle it explains the long wait, but nothing justifies the poorly prepared fish or the fact that we never received our apps. It is too bad really, because there is a lot to like about the Capital Tap Haus especially the clean, modern atmosphere, and a good beer selection. At the end of the day the only thing that kept this Fish Fry from being a total failure was the fact that we got to meet the nice folks from the Madison Beer Review.  And who knows, maybe well hook up with them again sometime for beers and chow? If indeed we do decide to get reacquainted with them, you can bet the farm that well choose somewhere other than the Cap Tap for the rendezvous.www.capitaltaphaus.com/107 State StreetMadison, WI 53703     (608) 310-1010",4682,0.1424721277399848,0.523181216931217

I love Wisconsin.There arent many bars that welcome kids with open arms, but Deaks really doesnt give a damn. They have a nice niche, and since there are a whole lot of parents who want to go to the bar and get fish Deaks is jam packed every Friday. When we showed up to meet our friends at 6pm the parking lot was crammed full with people parked on snow banks and cars overflowing into the parking lot next door. I feared the worst, but Deaks is misleadingly large and there were a couple open tables in the back, near one occupied by our friends Stan and Megan. No sooner had we all sat down than one of Deaks exceptional waitresses came right over. She sped off to get us a round of beers, and when she came back with them took our orders. Cod and lake perch are listed on the everyday menu and walleye is available on Fridays, but all three fish eaters in our group went with the every day perch. Considering how busy Deaks was the fish came quickly and looked pure. Each plate featured five large fillets that were coated in a light, golden colored beer batter. While my perch lacked seasoning, they were flaky and tasty. Adrian and Megans however, were much greasier although they appeared to maintain some of the flakiness. It was really a mixed bag which does hurt Deaks somewhat as consistency does count. Since the fish had some grease Deaks thick and creamy tartar was absolutely necessary. While it was mostly mayo it had just enough relish to let you know it was there. Similarly, the hash browns had just enough cheese and onion to be noticeable. The shreds were scrambled up and fried to a crisp with just a tad of shredded cheddar and a scant amount of onion. Most kids arent fans of coleslaw but Deaks mix might just be able to win a few of them over. Its a creamy and delicious blend with plenty of zip to cover any cabbage or other vegetable flavors. The roll was of the crusty, football-shaped variety, which is marginally better than a regular dinner roll, but its definitely a narrow margin. You wont find too many bars that welcome the whole family, but when you do you can bet they will be plenty busy on Friday nights. While Deaks isnt the best Fish Fry in the area it is good enough, and when you have you have a little one that makes it more than enough. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and think its a great addition to the Stoughton scene. www.deakspub.com1017 Nygaard StreetStoughton, WI 53598     (608) 873-4066",2611,0.2245283632578715,0.4714926239516403

One is having the perfect blend of spices in the batter or breading, while the other is guaranteeing the fish makes it from the fryer to my belly as quickly as humanly possible. The first usually comes with years of experience, but the second can be achieved overnight if heady cooks and a dedicated wait staff make a concerted effort to ensure that fish does not sit. Upholding this standard is a mark of dedication to the craft, and proves that the establishment is aware that serving a cold Fish Fry is simply unacceptable. We heard through the digital grapevine that Deaks Pub was the place to be on Friday nights, and that their Fish Fry was more than worth the short drive south. Jer and I made our way through the ice and snow, and eventually landed at the Stoughton hot spot during the peak of the frying hour. There was barely an open seat in the house, but we somehow lucked out, and scored some stools at the bar from a couple that happened to be finishing up just as we arrived. The bartender came over a minute or two later, grabbed us a beer then took our fish orders. I was feeling frisky and chose the $12 lake perch platter, while Jer got conservative and went for the $10 cod. There was also walleye available for twelve bones, but the king of the lake wasnt one either of our radars this evening. Well have to come back and give it a try some other time, and after this experience there will be another time, I promise you. Since Deaks was packed to the gills it took a few minutes for our fish to make it to the top of the cue. The short wait was no big deal since it gave us a chance to relax as we sipped our beers, and enjoyed the modern bar atmosphere that Deaks afforded. Eventually a plate of deep fried goodness appeared before each of us, but I noticed that mine was lacking a crucial component. The fries were nowhere to be seen, but before I could even get a word out our bartender/waiter informed me that they were not ready, but he didnt want to let the fish sit while they were being prepared. While I was a little perturbed that they didnt coordinate the frying better, I much appreciated that the fish was served scalding hot, and not sacrificed for a basket of fries. It was at this point I realized that Deaks knows the drill. With the fries on the way I had no choice but to scoop up one of five large perch fillets, and put it through its paces. At first taste I could tell that this was going to be a Fish Fry to be reckoned with. The perch was simply phenomenal. It boasted a light and flaky breading which had a little flavor, but not too much. The subtle amount of spice allowed for smooth taste of the flaky fish to shine through. The fish itself was incredibly light, almost airy, partially due to the fact that not a single speck of grease accumulated the entire time. It was divine.The transcendent perch practically made me forget that my fries were still coming, and I was a little startled when they suddenly appeared before me. The customary crinkle cuts were ungodly hot, and while nothing special, about as good as this type of fry can get. Jer paired his cod with an order of hash browns with cheese and onion, per the barkeeps recommendation, and was not disappointed. He allowed me a taste of the taters, and Id have to say they were nothing short of outstanding. Even though there was an extra charge for the upgrade, the delicate hint of cheese, and the understated essence of onion elevated the succulent shreds to new heights, making them well worth every penny. If/when we patronize Deaks again, this guy will be getting the hash browns with cheese an onion, I can tell you that. Punctuating the perch was Deaks thick, mayo-heavy tartar sauce. The tiny cupful tasted just about perfect, although it was not exactly plentiful. I probably could/should have asked for another, but the fish was so good that I didnt really even need it.  Likewise, Jer apparently doesnt need bread with his Fish Fry anymore, and didnt even give the tiny roll its day in court. I stole the abandoned bread, along with a piece of his well-seasoned, breaded cod, and enjoyed them on his behalf. Both roll and cod were well above average, and I had no qualms about making sure they didnt go to waste.Putting the icing on the cake was a generous cup of Deaks homemade coleslaw. It was finely chopped, exceptionally creamy, and perfectly zesty. I devoured it, and could have eaten more, which is a rarity for me since I am not a huge fan of the slaw. Jer also agreed that it was top-notch and Im pretty sure he polished his entire portion as well. Overall, we were somewhat surprised by the quality of this Fry and have no problem highly recommending it. Deaks has definitely done their homework and put all the pieces in the right places, even if it took a little extra time for them all to come together.

It isnt areal fish after all. However, after reading some glowing reviews of it on Yelp and other sites, I knew I needed to see what the hubbub was about, and at least set the record straight. What we found was a pretty good meal, but not what wed call a recommendable Friday Fish Fry.To start, this isnt exactly the cheapest Fish Fry you are going to find, coming in around twelve bucks. While thats not outrageous, it isnt exactly great for what you get. For your twelve skins you will recieve two lightly panko breaded pan-fried fillets of faux fish, some rosemary-garlic potatoes, a cup of homemade tartar sauce, and some house slaw.  The fish (which I believe is some kind of tempeh, but dont quote me on that) was remarkable, but off-putting at the same time. The faux duo was shaped such that they actually looked like two real fish fillets, and whats more, The Green Team also somehow even managed to make it taste fishy (I kid you not). It was a gallant effort, but while they nailed the taste and diamond shape silhouette, they came up short on the flaky texture that is the hallmark of any good fish. The (suspected) tempeh was very dense, as one might expect, and felt more like faux chicken (or Quorn) than fish. Furthermore, while it did mimic the taste of fish, it wasnt necessarily a great fish taste. It equated roughly to a high quality fish stick, which in our ranking system, would fall somewhere just below Sysco brand cod in a taste test. Instead of fries (I presume the Owl doesnt have a deep fryer, see the pan-fried fish above) we received a good portion of rosemary-garlic potatoes. My veggie wife just loved them, and while I agreed that they were very good, I didnt think they were as amazing as she did. They certainly did the job, and in reality were probably the highlight of the meal.The thin tartar sauce, which appeared to be some sort of mayo/sour cream hybrid, did what it could to give the phony fish a kick in the tail, but came up a little short. It was a dill-laced mix, which was totally devoid of relish, and just not all that tasty. The homemade slaw was a little better as its thick cuts of red cabbage played joyfully in a creamy sauce which appeared to house a fair amount of yogurt. I know right, yogurt? But it actually seemed to work, so well call it a win.I would have thought a vegetarian place would serve bread with pretty much everything, but none came with the Fish Fry. Its too bad really, as even that small addition would make the meal more substantive and easier for the traditional Fish Fry eater to swallow. The Green Owl is actually a pretty neat little place and they seem to be doing a great job of serving their neighborhoods needs. If youre a vegetarian you are going to love it, hands down, no questions asked. If youre not, Im afraid its going to be a bit of a different story. There is no way we could recommend this Fish Fry to a Fish Fry loyalist, and most would probably just laugh in our face at the mere suggestion of it. The fish is a little too veggie, the portion a little too small, and the meal just little too far out there in general. In actuality it was good food, just not a good Fish Fry.

March 2011 was two jobs, one child, and seemingly a lifetime ago. To be totally honest we didn't even really remember what their Fish Fry was like and were surprised to see lake perch listed on the white board when we entered (even though that's exactly what we had the last TWO times we were there). Oops.The lake perch has followed inflation trends and sits at $13 in 2019. Since I was skeptical that a plate of perch could be that cheap I asked the waitress if it was the real deal. ""What do you mean?"" was her response. ""The box says lake perch on it, so if it's not I guess it's false advertising."" That follow up was good enough for me, and true to the box's word these were real yellow perch fillets. Six come to an order and have a light breading that is just there to cover the fish. It was essentially flavorless, and while the lack of seasoning really allows the perch taste to come through, I'm really more of a overly spicy kinda guy. Crinkle cut fries are the name of the game at the Moon and give me the blues. Sure they are the standard side, but with so many other places doing house-cut fries, specialty hash browns, or at the least skin-on freezer fries, they just sort of pale in comparison. A dill laden tartar and an extremely dilly slaw were both surprisingly decent, while dill pickles also come as a side with the kid's grilled cheese. I guess the Blue Moon really knowns the dill... A dense football-shaped roll rounded things into formation and was crusty enough to set it apart texturally, but really not an improvement over a soft potato roll. With so many great Fish Frys around town it is tough to get them all in, and some get forgotten about from time to time. However, 7 years is really too long to forget about this one and we regret that it's taken this long. The Blue Moon is what it's always been and they aren't showing signs of changing any time soon and we like that.

Our waitress greeted us at the door and came over to our table just as we got comfortable. We both went for the $11.25 lake perch plate with a side of fries. Since we were the very first order to hit the kitchen the fish was ready in a flash. Each of our plates consisted of 6-7 pieces of lightly crusted lake perch, an abundant amount of crinkle cut fries, a standard sized cup of homemade tartar, an above average roll, and a unique coleslaw. The perch was plentiful and virtually covered the bevy fries beneath them. The flaky fillets were thin, but moist, and had a light, crumbly breading which let the subtle taste of the perch come through. I would have said it was pretty darn solid, but when I saw Reeses eyes get wide, I knew he was an even bigger fan than I. The crinkle fries were abundant, but very plain. They were just a tad under fried and could have benefited from another minute or two in the fryer. Both fries and fish were perked up slightly by the Blue Moons homemade tartar. The secret sauce was almost straight mayo with just the tiniest bit of relish and what appeared to be some red pepper thrown in. A unique homemade looking slaw and an above average white roll rounded out the lineup. The slaw was a strange zesty/creamy blend and finished with a definitive vinegar bite. It wasnt bad, but I didnt finish it off, if that tells you anything. Overall, this Fish Fry was very solid, and easy to recommend. The food was all above average, and the quick service helped us get in and out in just over a half-hour. Not bad, Blue Moon Not bad at all. www.bluemoonbar.com2535 University AvenueMadison, WI 53705     (608) 233-0441",1831,0.04954004329004329,0.4597186147186147

This area of U-Dub is home to the College of Ag and Life Sciences and their associated barns and farm style buildings. These livestock friendly edifices form a strong contrast to their ritzier and more glamorous counterparts near downtown, and in my opinion, help to tie the UW back to the real Wisconsin. Along these lines, the Blue Moon is tied much more heavily to the real Wisconsin than its equivalents on State Street or Regent Street, and offers a real Wisconsin Fish Fry that many of those places dont.Long ago when I lived on Old University we frequented the Blue Moon. In fact, the day I graduated from college we took my whole family there for a celebratory lunch. I always enjoyed their daily menu, but for one reason or another found their Fish Fry to be underwhelming. Since I was on campus and flying solo, I decided to that the Moon was a good option. I showed up around 11:30, noted the whiteboard special, and looked over the SPECIAL FRIDAY MENU from my barstool.  The menu abounds with cod and walleye options, but what really grabbed my attention was the lake perch special listed on the whiteboard. While the bartender said it was available every Friday, I was perplexed as to why it wasnt on the actual menu, but went ahead and ordered it anyway.My order went in, and the fish came out in about 3 minutes. It was seriously that fast. For $10.25 you are treated to 7-8 fillets of lightly battered perch, with all the trimmings. The fish was actually really good, and much better than the beer battered cod I have had in the past. It was incredibly moist while still being tender and flaky. The breading aided the fish, and while it didnt have a ton of flavor it was crumbly and light. It almost looked like the fillets were pre-battered due to how consistent the coating was, but it was so good it that must have homemade. The crinkle cut fries were not homemade however, but were still very good. The plentiful potatoes were as hot as the fish when served and maintained the Fish Fry standard. The tartar sauce was also really good, and while it may well have been from Sysco my Solo cup was 100% empty by the end. It was composed of a thick mayo base with an ideal amount of relish. While the portion was fair, the thirsty perch almost drank it all. Luckily a Fish Fry master, such as myself, knew the situation and allotted it perfectly. Rounding out the Fry was some homemade slaw and a packaged dinner roll. The slaw was nice and creamy, but didnt really have much zip. The white bun was average, but actually kind of stale which made it a little less desirable. By and large they were adequate, and certainly much better than going without.Overall, this was a really good Fish Fry and a complete one-eighty from my previous experiences at the Moon. While the cod has been lacking in the past, the perch really stood out. In addition, the bartenders and waitresses were doing a great job of keeping the food flowing and the patrons satisfied. I am really glad I bit the bullet and decided to give the Blue Moon another chance, and maybe on my next visit I will give the walleye dinner a whirl since, at ten bucks, it is seriously cheap. As it stands, the perch I had this trip is a definite winner and easily recommendable.  Forget the cows and chickens when you hit Westside of campus and head over to the Blue Moon for some lake perch, you wont be disappointed. I wasnt.  www.bluemoonbar.com2535 University AvenueMadison, WI 53705     (608) 233-0441",3663,0.21772001205545505,0.4769770946353225

In fact, wed say anyone whod make such a claim is a dirty, dirty liar. We do know a few things however, especially when it comes to Fish Fry. We know the best batters are light and flaky. We know that coleslaw and tartar are better when theyre homemade. We know that house-cut fries are better than the ones that come from the freezer. And we know that if a place says they have lake perch it damn well better be yellow perch and not some other crazy variety theyre trying to pass off as the real deal. And thats a fact.The last time we visited the Baldwin Street Grille they had real yellow perch and it was outstanding. While the portion was small, the quality was excellent and we enjoyed every single morsel. When we returned this time we assumed the perch listed on the menu as lake perch would be the same stuff. Seems logical, right? Sometimes logic escapes us The lake perch that came this time around was one massive fillet that looked very much like walleye. When the walleye theory was put forth to the waitress she assured us that it was perch, but a different variety than the expected yellow perch  supposedly from New Zealand (a little post-dinner digging led us to the European Perch which is present in New Zealand and most likely what they were passing off as lake perch). We couldnt help but feel a little duped. Regardless, the perch tasted decent although it was pretty plain. There was very little flavor present in the fish or the breading which, unfortunately was made up for with a number of bones we had to pick from our teeth. Overall, it was very average fish and certainly not the yellow perch we were craving. A side of fries came buried under the large fillet and were barely visible. They were skin-on, julienne cuts with plenty of salt, but since the fillet covered them up we had to peck around the edges to get at them initially. Once they were exposed they went down in bunches as they were well-fried and quite delicious. A couple tiny, cube-shaped ramekins occupied the center of the plate and were filled with coleslaw and tartar. While the portion of slaw was small, the taste was large and in charge. It was rich and creamy with a pleasant buttermilk-y flavor. On the other hand, the tartar was just okay. It was nontraditional and thin with a ranch-like consistency. There were a few little clumps in it which alluded to something more, but any sort of punch never arrived. Rounding out the Fry was a fat half-slice of marble rye that was soft and tasty. It was a welcome addition as it added the pop the rest of the items were lacking. As Wisconsinites and a Fish Fry fans we expect a few things on Friday night. We expect to wait in line if we get to a Fish Fry hotspot at 7pm. We also expect to drink a beer or two while we wait. We fully expect that anywhere that has a Fish Fry will have some form of cod. And (maybe most importantly) we expect anything sold as lake perch to be the genuine yellow perch we all love so dearly. Overall, we still recommend this Fish Fry, but are definitely torn be the imposter perch. While it was fine, it certainly wasnt what we were expecting from the Baldwin Street Grille. www.facebook.com/pages/Baldwin-Street-Grille/1332095300762511304 East Washington AvenueMadison, WI 53704     (608) 442-8400",3331,0.11173120350068398,0.46863795656003443

Yes!It took us a while. A hit here, a miss there, but never the bulls-eye we were hoping for. It began with a couple cod frys - both of which were fine, but unsatisfying. Then we totally missed the mark with the walleye. We almost decided to cut our losses at the BSG, but something brought us back. A notion? Wishful thinking? Whatever it was, our persistence paid off. This trip we tried the perch, and not some junky ocean perch either, the real deal, fresh from a lake somewhere. While the portion was still diminutive (four fillets for 10 bucks) every single morsel was pure pleasure on the palate. It took a minute to get our order placed, but once it went in the fish came out in a flash. It was literally like two minutes. It was crazy. While there were only the four fillets each one was a tiny work of art. They wore a beautiful breading that was thoughtfully spiced a played gracefully on the canvas of smooth white perch. The fish itself had that classic initial resistance followed by a forgiving lushness. It was just right, and I could easily have eaten a couple (if not 10) more. You might think $10 for four fillets is on the pricy side, but the price of perch has gone way up recently so Ill call it reasonable. Not good, but reasonable. Following the perchfect fish was a handful of what seemed to be standard Sysco fries. While I was hoping for some fresh-cuts (since the BSG tends to swing that way), I wasnt too disappointed since the familiar fries let the fish take center stage (although they arent included with the actual Fish Fry, necessitating a $1.50 side order  meh.) A thin but tasty tartar tried its best to boost the delectability quotient, but fell a little short. The ranch-y base had a few chunks added to it, and a zippy taste, but the perch was so good on its own that much of the sauce went unused. The thin slice of French bread was probably no better or worse than the average dinner roll, and was easily overshadowed by the rich and creamy homemade coleslaw that seemed to be spiked with buttermilk or some other indulgent substance. Twas delightful. Were so glad that the BSG finally put it all together. It really is a nice little bar and we love the fact that they go out of their way to make you feel at home (the bartenders even introduce themselves and make it a point to remember your name which is really unique in this day and age). Overall, we highly recommend the lake perch at the Baldwin Street Grille and have found ourselves thinking about it again and again. www.facebook.com/pages/Baldwin-Street-Grille/1332095300762511304 East Washington AvenueMadison, WI 53704     (608) 442-8400",2705,0.1288137755102041,0.524077380952381

You order fried fish, but the waitress brings you baked or broiled instead. Do you throw a tantrum, get secretly pissed, or just grin and bear it? Usually Ill pipe up and say something, but this time I just rolled with it since it was already getting late, Id had my share of drinks, and I just didnt want to deal with the hassle. Of course, it wasnt the end of the world, but it certainly wasnt the Fish Fry that I so desired.In truth, I should have just stuck with the cod or ocean perch since they come fried by default, but something inside me said go wit the walleye special. - it wound up biting me in the ass. To be fair, the baked walleye was very tasty. The two small pieces were flaky and delicate, and disappeared quickly, but while it was tasty, so is salmon, and that is clearly not a Fish Fry. It would have been nice if the waitress would have clarified that it was to come baked, but she didnt. Strangely, even though the fish was baked it came with a side of tartar. The sauce was thin and lacked mayo, but actually tasted alright. It helped out the fries, but of course, its meant for fish, so that is kind of a weak compliment. Speaking of the fries they only added to my disappointment as the usually delicious spuds were limp and under-fried, and actually needed the slight boost the received from the tartar. Finishing off this Fish Bake was some homemade coleslaw and a slice of French bread. The coleslaw was flat-out nasty, and while no one could put their finger on exactly what made it so bad it was it postulated to be anything from bitters to spoiled cabbage to rotten vinegar. Whatever it was, it was not good, and almost my whole portion was left at the end. The bread was better and maybe a step up from a standard dinner roll, but then again, maybe not. So, I guess you could call this a Friday failure. While the BSG has been fine in the past, pretty much everything this trip was wrong. Some blame falls on me for not clarifying my order, but most of it falls on the waitress (I know I said fried walleye) and some on the kitchen. While Ill never know what happened for sure, I do know that I cant recommend this Fish Fry since it wasnt fried at all. www.facebook.com/pages/Baldwin-Street-Grille/1332095300762511304 East Washington AvenueMadison, WI 53704     (608) 442-8400",2345,0.00015262515262515208,0.5192816442816441

No, me neither, but unfortunately for us, that was exactly the scenario when we arrived at the Villa Tap for Jers birthday Fish Fry. We were shocked, to say the least, but did what needed to be done.After the Tragedy at the Tap we decided to just pick up and move our crew towards downtown and give the Baldwin Street Grille another whirl.  Jer and I tried the BSG a few weeks prior during the lunch hour and could see there was a lot of potential. We were both less than impressed with the midday portion size, but figured the dinner would be bigger and better. We arrived at the East Wash eatery just before 7pm, threw a couple of round high-top table together, and waited for some friends to show. As we waited the waitress came by once or twice, brought some drinks, and joyfully bopped around the establishment serving her other customers. Once our whole party of eight showed we figured shed buzz right back over, but we were wrong. The BSG is pretty small and we tried our best to make her aware that Hey, were all here now and ready to order. Unfortunately for us, this little lady was a master at avoiding eye contact and continually roamed around the tiny establishment without paying us another visit. Luckily, we had a couple pitchers to keep us busy during her dawdling, but as they diminished and the clock kept ticking, people started to get antsy. Eventually we hailed her down and she begrudgingly came by with a pad and a pen. Everyone, and I mean everyone, in our group opted for the $8.75 Fish Fry, and like the service, it came slowly. Around 20 minutes after the orders hit the kitchen the plates started to roll out. A couple came here, a couple more there, which resulted in about 3 different shifts. Mine came in the final shift, but as it turns out, Im glad it did.As we suspected the dinner is slightly more substantial than the lunch rendition, consisting of two pieces rather than a single slab. My fish was light and flaky, and donned a light colored breading which was nothing less than superb. This charming coating was spicy, and incredibly flaky, blending well with the delicate fish underneath. It seemed everyone who got the final shift enjoyed a similar experience, but unfortunately, the first couple rounds of fish were slightly over-fried, resulting in a dark brown breading and slightly greasier fish. Even so, everyone deemed it more than acceptable. A couple different styles of fries were visible around the table with both regular and sweet potatoes in attendance. I actually got more of the tasty homemade-looking, straight-cut fries than I expected, and enjoyed every last one. The sweets which dotted the table were also deemed delicious proving the BSG knows its yams. The BSGs take on Fish Fry starts typically, and save for the absence of bread and their unique take on tartar sauce, it is. This zesty sauce is a thin blend, with a ranch base instead of a mayo base.  While I like a more traditional tartar this stuff tastes good, and I cant complain too much since by and large everyone else enjoyed it as well. Some homemade coleslaw put the finishing touches on the meal, and was really flavorful. It was quite creamy and did everything it could to pick up the slack left by the absent bread.   There is a lot to like about the Baldwin Street Grille, and well put their cod at the top of that list. There is still some room for improvement in our opinion, but most everything was very good. The service could certainly have been better  besides the general sluggishness, one person in our party recieved fried fish instead of the baked she ordered  but I wouldnt call it a deal breaker. In the end we all still got hot and tasty food when the time did come. Overall, this is a good Fish Fry and we feel confident recommending it.

While mass doesnt necessarily equate to excellence, when it comes to fish, small cuts can be a deal breaker especially if there arent many cuts to speak of. Personally, we are not fans of HUGE fillets, but we do expect there to be enough meat on the plate to make us feel like we have actually eaten something. When portions get too tiny we have a tendency to leave feeling empty inside, even if our wallets are still full.We heard about the all-new Baldwin Street Grill and really had no idea what to expect. Rumor had it the former JT Friendlys on the NE corner of East Wash and Baldwin, was offering Madisons newest Fish Fry, but thats basically all we knew. Since not knowing is not acceptable, we decided that we needed to get the lowdown on the BSG for ourselves. What we found in the tiny bar was a tiny Fish Fry with a tiny price tag to match.The lunch special at the BSG comes in at $6.75 which had me wondering right from the get-go since six seventy-five is pretty cheap for a plate of fish. My gut told me a supplemental cup of clam chowder would be a wise choice, and as per usual, its advice was sage. The chowder came before the rest of the meal, and while the $3 soup didnt knock my socks off, the addition made the meal much more substantial. The fish made its appearance 10 minutes later, and my suspicions were immediately confirmed. The single piece of cod which comprised the Fish Fry was thin, but tasty. The delicate cod was complimented by a light breading that had some spice to it. Unfortunately, the portion was so small that it was gone almost instantly, and even during its short life a tiny bit of grease developed. While the cod seemed to be high quality the portion was just far too tiny, and probably didnt justify the $6.75 price. Pairing with the non-traditional cut of cod was the BSGs homemade tartar. This sassy sauce was definitely a unique concoction, and while it tasted good, Im not sure I would really even call it tartar sauce per se. It was more of a horseradish/ranch blend, and served in a teensy fancy-schmancy square cup. This classical departure of a sauce had a distinctive zing, but did little to help the fish. There was no bread served with this lunchtime Fish Fry, and only a wee cup of slaw. Like the tartar, the finely-cut cabbage concoction was clearly homemade and served in the same small square cups. Unlike the tangy tartar, it lacked zest, and ran out quickly. By and large it was decent, but like everything else in this Fish Fry was gone in the blink of an eye making an accurate critique difficult due to the small sample size. Last, but not least, were the basket of fries that made their way to the table. Im reviewing the fries last since, like their spot in this review, they came out well later than the rest of our food. I suspect they were forgotten initially as the tardy taters were under-fried and lifeless. They were slathered with a bunch of Old Bay or something similar which made them more edible, but still not desirable. The less than punctual potatoes were your standard Julienne-cut, freezer-to-fryer jobs, but served in a much more generous portion than any other item in this Fish Fry. They would have served their duty more than admirably had they arrived with the rest of the food, but as it stood were more of an afterthought. The Baldwin Street Grille is a tiny place, but I didnt think their food would reflect that fact. It turns out there seems to be some sort of a twisted correlation, and we are probably going to need to investigate their Fish Fry further (likely around dinner time, when the portions are presumably larger). The food was high quality, tasty, and very stylish, and in the hopes that you get more bang for your buck during dinnertime, we would be willing to come back. Overall, we cant recommend their lunch Fish Fry due to the small portion of fish, the wacky tartar and the lack of bread, but we will keep them on our radar (even if it is just a small blip). www.facebook.com/pages/Baldwin-Street-Grille/1332095300762511304 East Washington AvenueMadison, WI 53704     (608) 442-8400",4151,0.08275651927437642,0.5043915343915343

It basically has it all, a good Norwegian sounding name the term Supper Club in it how could you go wrong with a place like that? You simply cant, end of story.It turns out the term Supper Club is applied a little liberally in the case of Swansons, and I would say its more of an tavern in drag. While the downtown DeForest eatery didnt feature the dimly lit dining room or the sprawling salad bar that we are accustomed to at most supper clubs, it did boast a few of the amenities you would expect. We arrived a little later than normal (8:15, to be exact) and the folks working the Friday Fish Fry were a bit taken aback by our crew of eight. We grabbed some drinks at the bar while they threw a couple tables together for us, and in no time one of the servers came right by. We had mostly Fish Fry eaters, and everyone except our lone vegetarian, ordered the $9.00 3-piece cod. While we waited, we feasted on the cellophane sticks, wheat crackers, saltines, and cheese dip that awaited us at the table. The cheese dip wasnt exactly what youd call fresh, but we didnt care, and polished off whatever remained in the bowl (MFF and friends arent all that picky, you see). While we enjoyed all the complimentary goodies, our crew liked the mini-breadsticks the best, despite our waitress claim that Swansons did not serve such an item. Peculiar. Just as we finished off all the (non-saltine) crackers, the fish showed up. The three large pieces of cod were thick and flaky, but a bit greasy. Wed  attribute it to the fact that they had to make so many pieces at once that it actually brought the temperature of the oil down. Regardless, the thicker than average batter that accompanied the fish had good flavor, and complimented the creamy cod well enough. While the fish was a little heavy I still ate every last morsel, unfortunately, the same could not be said by some of the lighter eaters in our party. Perhaps the reason I had no trouble downing the semi-greasy fish was Swansons tartar sauce. The mayo-rich blend was ultra-thick and easily picked up any slack the grease may have created. While the fish was not outstanding on its own, the tartar took it up a notch and made for easy eating.A large portion of crispy, batter-coated fries also came along for the ride and were very good. While they didnt appear to be cut in-house, the medium-thick, Julienne-cut fries were far better than average, and did what they needed to do. Some super creamy slaw rounded out the Fish Fry, and while it was far from perfect, the homemade brew was heavy on the horseradish and suited us just fine. We also appreciated the fantastic service from our, not one, not two, but three, yes THREE, different waitresses! They fawned over us throughout the meal, and even made sure our lone vegetarian got something she could be happy with. It was truly great. Even though Swansons isnt your typical Supper Club it is still a great place to grab fish on Friday. The fish was good, even if the batter was a bit much (truth be told, being a fish-guy, I knew this was the kind of fish that would reheat well, so I rounded up the undesired leftovers, took them home, and had a nice little Fish Fry for lunch the next day)  score one for the good guys! The fries and tartar were great, and the homemade slaw was just fine. The only bread we got were the breadsticks and crackers on the table, so well have to knock their score down a bit for that, but overall, we have no problem recommending the Fish Fry at Swansons. If you go expecting good fish, fries and tartar you should find it, if you go expecting a classic supper club atmosphere you certainly wont. Oh well, thats no big deal in our book since good fish and great service trump traditional atmosphere every time. 300 East Holum StreetDeForest, WI 53532     (608) 846-9788",3914,0.24900642957604988,0.5318520192887283

Ive been to Rudes a couple times before this and the fish was out of this world, so I was a little surprised time around. Yes, everything was still alright, and the portions were still abundant, but for some reason the fish was thickly battered, which is a no-no in my book.I rolled into Rudes for lunch and snagged one of the many open stools at the bar. The bartender came right over, grabbed me a Spotted Cow, and went through the fish specials. I passed on the walleye, and skipped the cod, instead picking the perch. Prior to the fish a plate with baked beans, coleslaw, and a dinner roll showed up. I pounced on them and enjoyed what I found. The slaw looked plain, but was zesty and flavorful; the beans were good, and loaded up with onion (which was a welcome surprise); and the roll was a roll. I polished off these precursors with ease and had a plate of fish in front of me moments later.The plate was piled high with five perch fillets and a bunch of fat crinkle-cut fries. It looked just right, but of course, looks can be deceiving. The perch were petite, which in and of itself isnt a problem, but they were drowning in batter. The semi-thick coating was simply too much for the fine fillets, and although it had a nice flavor it totally dominated the fish. While I fully believe the batter would have blended better with a beefier fish, it totally overwhelmed the lake dwellers. I even peeled some of it away at the end to get to the fish, but by then it had already gotten mushy, and was less than appetizing. The fat crinkles-cut spuds were well-fried, but straight Sysco. So that is what it is.Since the fish was so hearty it needed a thick tartar to offset it, and thats just what it got. The rich sauce was nice and creamy, and had the necessary pop  at least the first cup did. There was so much fish that a second cup was needed, but cup #2 was almost straight mayo (albeit chilled), instead of the appropriately relished first round. Was it a different shipment or maybe a different supplier altogether? I have no idea, but regardless, it was kinda odd to get two wildly different sauces with one Fish Fry. My final tab ended up at $15.70 so Im assuming the fish was around 11 bucks - which seems about right for the amount of food I got. Despite the overly-battered fish everything was done well and the portions were plentiful. Overall, I still recommend the lake perch at Rudes Lanes, but would probably get the cod next time since cod pairs better with the thicker beer batters. 210 East Holum StreetDeForest, WI 53532     (608) 846-5959",2609,0.1508407738095238,0.5062566137566137

Before the fish Rudes give you sides. Regular rolls, zesty coleslaw, and tasty baked beans stated their case. All were found guilty, and sentenced to life ingested.  Rudes cod glistened with grease. The fat chunks were somehow succulent, and delicious. The three big pieces were flaky, despite their omnipresent oil. Previously, the perch was less greasy than the cod. We prefer the perch, and would choose it next time.  Both fish shared the same light beer batter. Spotted Cow is delicious, fried or fresh, apparently.A pillow of Rudes fries brought the cod barward. Plain as can be, and not even well-fried, a total let down for the Fish Fry guy. Luckily, a potato pancake picked up the slack. It came late, at a point where I was already full. I ate every crumb anyway. Im good like that. The pancake was made from scratch, the apple butter on the side was too. For an undercooked starch it was still delicious. The melt-y spread insured that it was so.Mostly mayo makes for tremendous tartar. Evidence of relish gives it a kick. Rudes tartar kicks like a mule. The brutish blend battled the lavishly lubricated fish, and tamed it with saucy superiority. Four Solo cups came, filled to the brim. Four solo cups went, stacked neatly inside one another. Bye bye baked beans. So long sharp-tasting slaw. Happy trails thick tartar. Adios apple butter. Join your friend fried cod in beer battered bliss. Your work here is done.

We befriended a couple strangers a few weeks ago when we joined fellow Fish Fry fans Madison A to Z on their bold quest to eat at every restaurant in Madison (in alphabetical order, mind you). It was an enjoyable affair at Tobys, after which we found ourselves downtown spreading merriment and meeting more Fish Fry aficionados, one of whom insisted that we meet his friends, The Rudes.Even though we had just visited The Swansons in DeForest the previous Friday I decided to take the short jaunt up Highway I and meet The Rudes anyway. We introduced ourselves around 6:30, looked over their lanes briefly, and took a spot at the bar. One of the bartenders came by right away, and took our orders: a couple of Cows, a plate of perch, and a burger (for Garrett I know, lame, right?). She brought the beers first then returned with a small plate containing a roll and cups of coleslaw and baked beans for me. As per usual, I got chummy with the grub right away and polished off every last crumb. The roll was fresh and soft and served with a pat of room-temperature butter which was fine, but had I known my options I would have certainly chosen differently. The option in this case was to substitute a homemade potato pancake for the regular roll, which I would have jumped at had I known it to be available. Since I balked on the PP I was left with the creamy, horseradish-laden slaw (which appeared to be homemade), and baked beans which were a nice addition and bridged the gap between the this plate and the entrée adequately.There was a good 15 minute lag before our new friends introduced us to the main course making me wish Id made the slaw and beans last longer. During this frying period we actually saw the cook  (this guy) come right over to the tap, fill the batter bucket with Spotted Cow, go back to the fryer, attempt to batter a piece, realize it was still too thick, and come back for more of the Cow. It was pretty cool to see, and clued us in to the Rude methodology. My $11 plate of perch arrived fresh from the fryer about 5 minutes after that incident and was simply too hot to handle. I waited as long as I could, acquainting myself with the fish less after less than a minute later.The beer batter was superb and nearly bubbled off the 4 small butterflies of perch. The incredibly light batter had a translucent golden-brown-ness and complimented the razor thin, tender fish perfectly. It was simply fantastic and probably in the top 5 we have eaten. Pushing the fish even further up the ladder was Rudes tartar which was rich and creamy with the perfect amount of relish. The fries werent exactly unwelcoming, but the plain crinkle-cut numbers didnt go out of their way to make us feel comfortable. While they were fried well, the portion was small and, they were so boring they left me wishing a potato pancake or two could have been substituted for their blandness. It turns out our friend from the bar had the story straight - Rude is a dude who knows his Fish Fry. I think it is fair to say that we have a new friend in DeForest and will make it a point to canoodle with his delicious fish sometime again soon. The perch was superb and from the looks of it, the cod, walleye and smelt arent far behind. Overall, we highly recommend this fish fry and suggest you go introduce yourself as well. Who knows? You might just make yourself a new friend, we did. 210 East Holum StreetDeForest, WI 53532     (608) 846-5959",3507,0.14845134317737052,0.49065019455430403

The Friday rush can be more than a lot of places can handle and adding the promise of seating people at a specific time could become unbearable (especially under an AYCE scenario). Of course, there are some exceptions to that rule and Fish Tales is one of them. Fish Tales will take you reservation but it's more of a ""soft hold"" in my opinion. We made ours for 6:30 and got in around 6:45 which on a Friday I'd say is fair. Plus, it gave us plenty of time to have a cocktail...or two (actually three) since we got there a little before that even.Once we got all squared away things ran like clockwork. Our waiter, Bennett, stopped by immediately, grabbed our orders (since we'd had plenty of time to figure out what we wanted prior to sitting down), and came back in flash with a nice warm basket of pre-cut French bread slices. Warm bread is always a huge bonus and these fluffers played perfectly with the simply superb clam chowder (added for an up-charge). This chowdah had it all, and thick and creamy base with plenty of potato and just enough clam bits to floating near the bottom to let you know they're there. It set the stage perfectly for the main event which came shortly thereafter. FTs has quite a few fish to choose from including lake perch and bluegill, but I stuck to my guns and ordered the ""Friday Fish Fry"" which is a 3-piece haddock. While I knew from previous experience the bluegill was great the haddock might have been even better. The 3-pieces were just the right size, and just the right fry. They were home to a golden breading that had a noticeable amount of seasoning and stayed light and grease-free. The fat and flaky planks of meat peeled apart effortlessly when desired, but held together under the weight of the breading. This stuff practically floated on air and my only qualm was that there wasn't an AYCE options, because I guarantee you I would have put down a minimum of seven pieces. This is the good stuff. While the haddock easily held its own it was even more appealing when slathered with the Tales' homemade tartar sauce. This stuff was simply superb with a tangy sweetness any other sauce would envy. It really made the haddock something more and clung to it with reckless abandon. I could eat this stuff solo with a spoon...not even joking. Fish Tales has lots of potato options to choose from and the potato pancakes were a wise move. While saying it plural was a misnomer, the one big cake necessitated its own side plate and came with a 4 oz cup of apple sauce perched right on its savory belly. Syrup was also an option, but also an additional up-charge, and I felt good with apple sauce side. The pancake itself had a great flavor with just enough onion essence and all other elements in balance. While it was a gigantic disc I could easily have eaten at least one more. Perhaps you are sensing a theme here... Last on the list was some homemade slaw which was creamy and tasty but took a third row seat to the fish, cakes, and sauce. I'm sorry I can't remember more about it, but when the Big 3 is this good it's easy to overlook even the best of slaws. All in all this has to be one of the best Fish Frys we've had in a long long time, but we'd be remiss if we didn't mention our boy Bennett one more time. His service was simply spectacular and delivered in a cool and casual demeanor despite the Friday crush he was dealing with. Well done, young man, well done. Overall, we highly highly recommend this Fish Fry and think you'd be wise to make your own reservation at Fish Tales as soon as possible.  www.fishtalesrestaurant.com/W12690 State Road 188Lodi, WI 53555     (608) 592-4266",3735,0.2736172954030097,0.5481591424448565

We know this and we embrace it to some extent. With a toddler in tow such waits can be a deal breaker so we usually try to arrive at places that get busy before the rush hits. Usually this method works, but occasionally it doesnt and this occasion was one where it didnt.We arrived at Fish Tales just before 6:00 figuring we were on the cusp, but hey, it takes a while to get all the way up there so we just rolled with it. Upon entering it was clear they were already busy, but they have a large outdoor patio and when quoted an hour it seemed doable. Unfortunately, Tales takes (and actually holds) reservations and our wait quickly stretched from 60 minutes to 75, to 90, and eventually ended near the two hour mark. Luckily, our little guy was a trooper and we made it, but just barely. Now, I understand waits are inevitable sometimes and we should have made a reservation (not sure if I knew this or just forgot about it) but a better estimate would certainly have swayed us in a different direction. Our take away is this: if youre a hostess and you have reservations on the list with lots of walk-ins, dont give them itll be about an hour routine if you have even the slightest inkling it will be way longer than that. Sure, you might lose their business for the night (no one wants to wait for more than an hour), but chances are you will keep it for years to come and next time theyll probably make a reservation. For us, yeah, you kept our business tonight (because what choice did we have after already waiting an hour), but potentially lost it for life. Moral of the story: just be honest and it will work out best for everyone in the long run. We werent the only ones this happened to either. The dude who got seated just after us was pissed, like yelling expletives pissed (and he wasnt even dealing with a tired two tear old) With that unpleasantness out of the way lets talk turkey (fish), which was excellent (as you might expect considering the crowd). When we finally did get seated at almost 8pm our waitress was empathetic and got everything in ASAP. Some bread comes to every table whether fish is ordered or not, and mine was accompanied by some of FTs exemplary clam chowder. The soup was thick and peppery, with a high proportion of sandy clam bits to go with the squishy taters. The round loaf of bread also served us well and was instantly devoured as we were starving at this point - soft, crusty, spot-hitting, but eaten somewhat begrudgingly after such an arduous journey. The bluegill comes in a 18 beans, which isnt cheap, but is reasonable considering all you get with it. The portion was princely as at least 10 fat fillets filed the plate. Each was a tiny morsel of heaven with the subtle fishy flavor it should have and a light breading with just a hint of seasoning. The fish and breading struck a harmonious balance with their great textures, and ushered in a wave of satisfaction that made us slightly less POd. As a supper club kind of place Fish Tales has lots of options for sides and we went hash browns with cheese ($0.50 extra) and onion (another $0.50 extra). This rendition was definitely tasty, but in the end Im not sure about the buck upcharge. Sure a piece of cheese is nice the onion was piled high but Im on the fence as to the actual value. A classic tartar canoodled with the fish with a sweet taste and thick consistency. It was easy to love and the HUGE cup was more than adequate for the abundant bluegill. It was the icing on the proverbial cake and further soothed our jaded soul. Damn it. I wanted to be mad after the excruciating wait, and I wanted the fish to be mediocre so Id have a reason to stay that way, but I simply couldnt and it simply wasnt.  The grub was superb, it was worth the drive, and it makes me want to come back, but I dont know if we can. The wait was just too daunting and unless we have reservation we cant deal with that. Our advice: MAKE A RESERVATION!!! and basically dont go if you dont have one. This is the worst for us since overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry, but likely wont be back until our little guy can stomach the sit.  www.fishtalesrestaurant.com/W12690 State Road 188Lodi, WI 53555     (608) 592-4266",4303,0.09421022067363534,0.5310753000387147

In actuality I had no intention of taking the 40 minute trek to Lake Wisconsin this particular Friday, but when Gabe said Fish Tales was the spot to be, who was I to deny him? We piled in, plowed a path through DeForest, Dane, and Lodi, and wound up lakeside around 7:40.Weve feasted at Fitzs, and ate our fill at Anchors Away in the past, hearing tales all along of additional tasty fish on the southern shore. Since it was Good Friday I knew a place like Fish Tales would be busy, but figured arriving late would put us in a good spot regardless of the crowds. It turned out the spot it left us in was with an hour wait, but we were expecting that and rolled with the punches. The bar was packed with what seemed to be regulars, and we were lucky to procure one stool amongst them (more or less three). By the time our name was called around 8:40, we were a few beers deep, and more than ready to eat.Even though Fish Tales is pretty supper clubby we were hoping to get to eat relatively quickly since it was already late when we sat down. Unfortunately, we had a young(er) waitress and it took awhile for her to come over and take our orders, and even longer to bring the bread/soup after she did. Luckily, the soup and bread were fantastic and put her lackadaisicalness out of our mind for the time being.The soup was homemade clam chowder which I substituted for their coleslaw for an additional two bucks. It was well worth the extra expense as the creamy chowder was probably some of the best Ive had (at least recently). The bread was also outstanding as the soft round loaf was nice and warm, looked homemade, and boasted a near-perfect crust. The only drawback was that it disappeared instantly amongst our trio and the waitress never brought the extra loaf we requested (not once, but twice). Oh well... Around 9pm the fish arrived and appeared just slightly larger than average at first glance. However, the hearty haddock was incredibly dense, and while it was soft and flaky, it was a total bear to eat. The meaty loins housed a semi-thick, golden batter which was good, but almost lost on the hefty fish. After the big bowl of soup and bevy of bread I consumed beforehand there was simply no way I could finish all three of these monsters. While the fish bordered on excellence it was just too beastly to eat in one sitting, and one of my three behemoths and one of Gabes were relegated to a to-go box, contritely removed from the establishment, and eaten for lunch the following day. For my side I picked the potato pancakes which were good, but more like hash browns than a true potato pancake. They didnt have a distinctive onion taste, but were very fluffy and well prepared. The tartar was also good, as the thick mayo blend was hearty enough to stand up to the bullish haddock. A pinch of relish gave it a needed kick and the supplied to-go cup made it easy to snatch up the excess when time came for boxing. Besides the solid haddock, a $17 lake perch appeared on the menu, as did a $25 plate of fried lobster. I really wanted to try the fried lobster, but couldnt bring myself to pull the trigger. I also shot another blank by not arriving early enough for the lake perch which was long gone by the time we ordered. The haddock did admirably in their stead, but a plate of perch would have given us yet another fish tale to tell.Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry even if we had a longer than average wait, a so-so server, and couldnt get our paws on the perch. The haddock was still very good, as were the potato pancakes and the tartar. The fantastic bread and competent chowder helped to put everything over the top and make for a memorable meal. Fish Tales is certainly worth the short drive north, and sits admirably as the third jewel in the crown of Fish Frys surrounding the Merrimac Ferry on the southern shore of lovely Lake Wisconsin.www.fishtalesrestaurant.com/W12690 State Road 188Lodi, WI 53555     (608) 592-4266",4013,0.1827092846270928,0.4637355946944989

Fool me twice, shame on me. Fool me three times??? Im not sure exactly what goes in here, but it must be a super-duper shame on me of some sort, and boy do we deserve it. Truth be told, I should really have known better, but I have a soft spot for the old Alma Matter. What can I say? I really want the UW to represent Fish Fry the right way, and have given them the benefit of the doubt time and time again, but the fact of the matter is that they just dont know what theyre doing when it comes to the holiest of Wisconsin traditions. To be honest, I didnt expect much from the Rathskellar or the Mendota Grill, but I figured when Alumni weekend was at stake, the U-dub would do what it needed to do to impress its graduates (and donors, mind you); their Wisconsin Fish Fry (which was supposed to be a celebration of Wisconsin culture on the UW campus) certainly did not excite anyone. The food was served buffet style with four individual buffet setups (making for 8 possible lines). The event definitely didnt sell out, and not one tables had anything remotely close to resembling an actual line. It was definite overkill, and caused the fish to sit in their steam tray environs for far too long. As such, the pre-battered cod was limp, mushy, and seemingly the exact same stuff we have come to expect at the student dining halls. The flake-less fish was suffocated by a batter coffin and was edible, but more in a McFish kind of way, rather than an Im really enjoying this kind of way. Since the fried cod was nothing to write home about I gave the baked a shot as well. The bland, dry cuts were not much better, and basically flavorless when push came to shove. There was none of the customary drawn butter or lemon to go on it, presumably because it was all used on the Parslied Potatoes which were drowned in lemon flavor, and served as the substitute for our beloved French fries. The citrus blast overpowered the baby reds, and no matter how parslied they were, the sprigs charge was futile when put up against it lemony adversary.Pairing with the uninspired fish was a strange, almost-KFC style, tartar sauce. The sauce appeared to be mass produced, but somehow still made the fish a little tastier. Jer actually claimed to outright enjoy the bizarre blend, but I personally wouldnt go quite that far as it was just a little too odd (and too processed) for my tastes. A coleslaw offering lacked zest, but was a creamy, inoffensive blend. While it wasnt the greatest ever, it kept you coming back for more, kind of like a PBR. Two different kinds of buns rounded out the Fish Fry portion of the buffet and were also just fine. A light rye played the traditional rolls roll, and was a little better than its white counterpart which was more of a ho-hum offering meant to please the kids should they have attended with mom and dad. For your $15 the buffet was stocked with more than the standard Fish Fry fare, giving the vegetarians a few options and the fish eaters a respite from the subpar seafood. The mixed spring vegetables, and squash risotto, werent much to crow at however, and while they were a bonus, it was like getting a company ham at Christmas.Overall, there is no way we can recommend this Fish Fry, and were inclined more than ever to say that we wont get fooled by the UW again. Damn you, Bucky! Why cant you just do Fish Fry right? Your attempts are half-hearted, and seem like nothing more than a ploy to make a few extra bucks for some new football jerseys. The only silver lining (if there was one) was that we supported our Alma Mater and got to check out the new Union South, but when it comes to the Fish Fry, school pride alone isnt enough to erase the bad taste left in our mouths. www.uwalumni.com/aw12_fishfryfun.aspx1308 West Dayton StreetMadison, WI 53703     (608) 265.3000",3863,0.13433251021279194,0.4706455907160133

But it was the wifes birthday and she likes Eldorado a lot so when I saw that they had a Fish Fry for Craft Beer Week I knew what needed to be done.Eldorado is a Mexican-fusion kind of place, and doesnt even have a Fish Fry normally so I figured theyd be shooting from the hip. They used to have a spicy breaded perch offering that we sampled once, but I noticed that even that has disappeared from the normal menu. The CBW special was an Ale Asylum Bedlam 3-piece cod with sweet potato fries, chipotle horseradish tartar, and a salad for an eye-popping $17.00. While you totally expect to pay a little more at Eldorado, $17 is exceedingly steep especially considering what you actually get. The cod was decent, but the portion was pretty tiny. The three small chunks were home to a medium-thick batter that definitely had some Bedlam in it, but not much flavor beyond that. It was on the creamy side and as a place just dabbling in fried fish they didnt have the process down which led to copious amounts of grease oozing from the fragile loins. It required numerous rotations on my part to keep it from turning into a soggy mess. On the side sat a petite portion of shoestring style sweet potato fries. While they were liberally salted they were slightly under-fried and limp. Sweet potato fries are a tough beast to tame and not something to rush into for a couple weeks. Instead of a traditional tartar sauce the Eldorado had a Mexican-y rendition. Theirs was a chipotle-infused mix that looked superb and had a delicious smoky flavor with a nice horseradish pop. It definitely gave the lackluster fish a boost, but was atypical to say the least. Since Eldorado is a fancier-than-average place you know they are going to jazz things up a bit and thats exactly what they did with their sides. They eighty-sixed the bread altogether and had a fancy salad stand-in for the customary coleslaw. The salad was exemplary and featured a tangy dressing that reeked of beer (in a good way). It was a nice surrogate for the slaw, but it still didnt make up for the absent starch. While I appreciate the effort to be cool and unique Ill take some boring old slaw and a regular roll any day of the week. While I expected this wasnt going to be a great Fish Fry I still had hope that they would put out something decent for Craft Beer Week. I guess It simply wasnt meant to be. In the end the highlight of the meal wound up being the $3 pint of Bedlam that came at a discount with the fish.

At best, you might call it a modern version of the Wisconsin classic, but thats even a bit of a stretch. Why did we even waste a Friday on it, you might be inclined to ask? Well, one, we need to have the lowdown in case someone happens to inquire about it, and two, we had a bunch of friends going there and didnt really have any better options (save for a solo outing at the Villa tap), so we bit the bullet and joined Ruthies tribunal.  The  Fried Perch with Chipotle Horseradish and Slaw runs a hefty 18 bucks and is easily the closest thing The Eldorado offers to a Fish Fry. To their credit the four small lake perch fillets were actually pretty decent, although certainly not plentiful. They housed a very light cornmeal batter which lacked any flavor of its own, but allowed the essence of the perch to come through. The inoffensive fish made the horseradish chipotle cream sauce all the more important. The spicy sauce is not your classic tartar, but the Eldorado rendition held its own and gave the fish a needed kick in the tail. In lieu of our beloved fries, some chilled chipotle potatoes made an appearance. The texture was reminiscent of a chunky potato salad, while the tangy taste was anything but. Some pinto beans and a hearty portion of homemade red cabbage slaw rounded out the plate along with a few raw onion loops. The slaw was fine, but unlike the chipotled items it lacked any zest. It, and the beans were adequate, but nothing more than a change-up from the fish.There are plenty of places where we could get two big old Fish Frys for eighteen bucks, more or less one skimpy one. As such, there is no way we can recommend the The Fried Perch with Chipotle Horseradish and Slaw at Eldorado. For the Fish Fry faithful the portion of fish was too small, the potatoes didnt measure up to the standard, the dipping sauce was too far from the norm, there was no bread, and the slaw was atypical. However, a diner not expecting the typical level of Friday gluttony might actually take comfort in Eldorados lighter fare. Not us, but someone... maybe...  www.eldoradogrillmadison.com/744 Williamson Street # 2Madison, WI 53703     (608) 280-9378",2262,0.18159199774584386,0.44041795811026585

There is something extra special about this recipe that makes it stand out from any I've had before. It's definitely a ""secret sauce"" situation and one that they've been wise to keep to themselves. The only thing they divulge is that Spotted Cow is involved somewhere in the process, but that is undoubtedly just the tip of the iceberg.Now, Hooterville Inn used to be Aunt Mary's Hooterville Inn and while I have no idea what the ownership situation is currently, things have definitely changed over the last year or so. They have a new website, new menu, and even a new sign out front, all which make no mention of one ""Aunt Mary."" It seems that these updates extend all the way to the staff as the bartenders and cooks aren't the same faces I recall seeing on my first few visits to Blue Mounds. Regardless, everyone is still friendly, and the recipe for that benevolent batter remains in tact, although the execution has slipped to some extent. This Friday we had a HUGE group that wanted to get together and since some were coming from the Dubuque area and some from the Madison area Hooterville seemed like the perfect halfway point. We made a reservation for 6:00 (Hooterville actually takes them on Fridays) and everyone eventually trickled in by 6:30 or so. We essentially had the whole back room to ourselves and a lot of attention from the lone waitress. With the evolution in style has come a jump in price, and while it's a small skip it's still noticeable. The 3-piece cod is up to $13 from $11 and they'll still let you tack on additional pieces for a couple bucks a piece. Now, the kitchen at the Inn is TINY so getting flooded with 12 orders from a single group all at once has to be daunting, but they did a fairly remarkable job chaining them all together and ensuring that we all had food in front of us at the same time. Any conversation about the quality of the HI FF starts and ends with the fish so lets begin there. As per usual the batter had a dark golden color and a smoky/creamy flavor (this didn't deviate from the norm and we hope it never will). When it's done right, it's paper thin and like nothing you've ever seen before; but like any batter, if left too thick it can become overwhelming. Historically, the batter has been nice and thin on every piece. This was always accomplished by letting the excess drip thoroughly between the battering and frying stages (I know, I sat right next to the fryer a couple times and watched it happen). I'm not sure if the haste to produce 12 orders in succession caused this step to be missed or just expedited, but what I can be sure of is that the coating was much thicker than normal. I also noticed a fair amount of batter ""cling-ons"" as I looked around the table - you know those areas where the batter slips away from the the meat and solidifies into a frizzly crispy chunk but remains attached to the fish? Those. For the most part the cod itself was pure and moist although one in our party claimed theirs was dry. Out of my five pieces (I added a couple extra with the intent on taking them home) three were spot on, while two had a lot of the clingers...none were ""dried out"" in the slightest though. I know that all may sound disparaging, but overall the flavor was still excellent, the execution was just a bit off. Whereas attempting to prep and fry upwards of 30 pieces of cod all all at once may have overwhelmed the small frying station, the flat top had no problem with the six or so orders of hash browns with cheese and onion that came its way. The side dish looked pristine and had the slick sensation we've come to know and love. The edges were crisp, the interiors were soft and the cheese was melt-a-rific. Reports around the table also gave high marks to the signature reds, as well as the grilled shrimp. As a Fish Fry fiend I put a lot of stock in tartar since I think it can do more to bolster a mediocre Fish Fry than any other factor. For that reason, I take my tartar very seriously and appreciate places that go above and beyond with what many consider a throw away category. The Hooter sauce is a bold blend that comes in a big old squeeze bottle that always keeps me coming back for more. The creamy sauce pairs so well with the rich beer batter that it seemingly activates a totally different group of flavor receptors. Not sweet, not salty, but savory...For me pairing this batter with this sauce is the true definition of umami. While bread is a big deal to me, it's clearly fallen totally out of favor in 2017. Tons of the pumpernickel rye went uneaten (I filled a take out with everyone's leftovers), but I was happy as a clam to scoop the creamy and tangy slaw all over those dark brown planks. The addition of bread (and booze) is also what makes a Fish Fry a Fish Fry; it serves to differentiate the true Wisconsin classic from the more ubiquitous (and more boring) fish-n-chips. So the day bread totally disappears from your Friday Fish will indeed be a dark day in the Badger State. As a wise man once said ""Oh, the times they are a-changin',"" and we couldn't help but notice the evolution on this trip to Blue Mounds. While everything was still good, I definitely can't make the ""Best of"" argument that has come so readily when talking about Hooterville. I think some of this can be chalked up to the fact we tried to cram a square peg in  round hole - I mean, taking 12 people to a small bar is probably too much to ask of anyone - but things were definitely a little off in general. Overall, we still highly recommend this Fish Fry although I think we'll stick with parties of four or so from here on out. www.hootervilleinnwi.com10992 Division StreetBlue Mounds, WI 53517     (608) 437-5444",5810,0.12936622567463685,0.48005660746314943

Of course, that's a loaded question since there are so many varieties of fish, and if you ask 10 people you will get 10 different answers. Everyone has their own opinion, that's just the nature of the beast. For better or worse, most people eat cod, so when they ask that question what they really mean ""who has the best cod?"" That one is much easier to answer - the Hooterville Inn.The HI lives down in Blue Mounds which is great if you live in Mt. Horeb or Verona, but not so great if you live on the east side like we do. It's a haul to get all the way down there, but one we're starting to make more often...it's definitely worth it. Plus, they'll let you make a reservation which ensures you won't be waiting hours for a table since it is a small place and they get busy, busy, busy on Friday nights. We made our reservation for 6:00 and showed up about 5:45 which was a smart move as the bar was standing room only by six. They only serve cod at Hooterville, but you can get it baked so it's not fried or nothing at least. That said, once you've had the fried cod you're probably  never going to want anything else again. It comes as a 1,2, or 3-piece, but if you're hungry, or just smart, you can add more for $2 each and take them home with you. I did just that (a 3-piece with two extra), but unsurprisingly, between the three adults and one toddler at the table neither made it home. This cod is damn near perfect, in fact I'm not really sure how it could get any better. The batter is as smooth and creamy as they come, and it keeps the fillets moist without trapping any grease. It's a modern marvel and some of, if not the absolute best cod you will ever eat. The flavors are simply out of this world. Whereas the hash browns with cheese and onion were a little stiff on our last visit, the grill was hot and slick and ready to go this time and these babies were lubed to perfection. The simple shreds were loaded up with cheddar and slid down the gullet with ease. They were everything you expect them to be and much better than the standard freezer fries. They also offer some spectacular baby reds if you're feeling even more adventurous. The cod at the Inn could easily be eaten without tartar but if you're like me you like the finishing touch a sassy sauce provides. Tons of the good stuff in a big old squeeze bottle live at the table and keeps me coming back for more. This is the good stuff - thick and smooth, with all the pop you want and none of the skunky flavors you don't. No real Fish Fry is complete without a slab of bread and a scoop of slaw and the dense slice of real pumpernickel and a banging slaw at Hooterville do exactly what they are supposed to do. You can't have the best Fish Fry without the best fish, and after having literally thousands of them I think this may well be it. This cod is simply above reproach and is as close to perfect as I can ever remember eating. It's high praise for sure, but I think they are as deserving of it as anyone. Overall, we highly, highly, highly recommend this Fish Fry and can't wait to come back for the next round. I'm sure it won't be long. www.hootervilleinnwi.com10992 Division StreetBlue Mounds, WI 53517     (608) 437-5444",3277,0.2379273571956498,0.4615955284552844

It's not every day I get the chance to make it all they way out to Bluemounds so when I do I take full advantage. This might well be the best Fish Fry on the plant after all.Hooterville only has cod, and I use 'only' lightly since they really don't need anything else. The cod comes in three sizes with the biggest being the $13 3-piece; but luckily for those with a big appetite (like I had this week) more can be added for a couple bucks a pop. I was early and had my fish in the fryer just after 5:00. My 5-piece (yes, you read that right, 5-piece) was ready a few minutes later and looked as daunting as you might expect. There was a ton of fish, and these are small either, but after the first bite I knew I'd made the right decision. More than likely, this is the best beer batter in the universe. It's dark and rich and the Spotted Cow gives it a flavor unlike any other. It's so smooth and creamy that it turns the flaky cod into something else altogether. There is definitely something secretive going on beyond the disclosed Cod, and it doesn't appear they're letting that cat out of the bag any time soon. As per usual the Fry comes with your choice of sides, one of which is hash browns. These cheese and onion are an up-charge and usually well worth it, although they frying was a little off today. The cheddar and onion didn't get fully incorporated into the mix and thus they weren't as slick as expected. The griddle also seemed to be lacking oil as a few black spots showed up and tainted the flavor meld. Tons of tartar was there for the taking and I went back to the well at least four times. It comes in a big squeeze bottle and they probably needed a fresh refill at my spot when all was said and done. This blend is thick and creamy and just what the doctor ordered for the decadent cod. The capers were a creamy coleslaw which was pretty basic and could well just have been Sysco, and a real slice of rye bread. The slaw added a punch and the rye rocked it with a classic stank.  When you're talking Fish Fry the bulk of the conversation should be centered on the fish, and the Hooterville Inn really dominates the dialog. This is arguably the single best fish anywhere is Wisconsin and something you really have to taste to believe. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and think it jut might be the best we've ever had. You'd be wise to try it. www.hootervilleinnwi.com10992 Division StreetBlue Mounds, WI 53517     (608) 437-5444",2515,0.1451442307692308,0.3977701465201466

We love the Hooterville Inn. The HI is the kind of small town bar that just screams Fish Fry. While the bar isnt necessarily nice, nor is it spacious, it has that certain it factor. When youre talking Friday Fish, it can mean different things to different people. It can be a smell. It can be a certain flavor of people. It can be dedicated wait staff who knows what the Friday Fish Fry is all about. Hooterville has all these its, and then some.I got my fair share of it since I showed up really early, intent on slugging down a bunch of beer before my fish. In all honesty, I was waiting for Jer who was out in the swamp sharing his love of regional amphibians with likeminded locals which gave me a couple hours to watch the operation and take in just what makes it so great. Heres what I learned Hooterville has a head fry cook, and she has it. With but a few waitresses and one kitchen helper she pumps out plate after plate of pristinely fried fish simply by sticking to a routine. Its really all about timing and since the clock in her head is never off her fish is never over or under-fried. Blend her keen intuition with some of the worlds best beer batter, and you start to see what it is all about. It was after nine when Jer finally got out of the swamp, but since the good folks in Blue Mounds knew what our scenario was they made sure to keep fryers hot for us. We wound up being the last non-employee fish order of the night, but even so, our fish was fried with the same care and attention as all those before it. After watching so many orders go from the batter, to the fryer, to the tables I was more than ready to dig into my own plate the second it arrived. Our 3-piece dinners were glistening with a sheen of oil, and steaming hot. The batter on the cod was somewhat dark, but has a fantastic flavor. It was rich and smoky, and turns the plain cod into anything but. While a thick beer batter can mask the flavor of the fish the Hooterville batter is light and flaky since each and every piece goes through a routine - grab it, dunk it, let er sit, let er drip, then let er rip. It is poetry in motion to witness, and even more satisfying to eat. The cooks mastery doesnt end with the fish either. I watched pile after pile of hash browns meet the grill, only to be flipped at the exact right time, and slathered with cheddar only when appropriate. Like mine, every batch appeared to be almost perfect, especially when complimented by a hearty dose of lightly grilled onion. Any good beer battered cod should be accompanied by a thick and creamy tartar and you know the experts at Hooterville are well aware of that fact. Like everything else, the homebrew was almost perfect and even though the fish didnt need it, it still took it to the next level when applied. Protip: the normal tartar just sits on the counter in a big squeeze bottle, but if you want a fresh, cold one ask for a to-go cup from the kitchen helper - its the way to go.Continuing the theme of amazing amazingness was the piece of real rye I chose over white. It was soft and fresh, and really perked up the coleslaw (which was the only failing in the Fry). While the slaw was creamy, and appeared to be homemade, it wasnt zesty and would have fallen flat if not for the rye. It means different things to different people, but if youve been to Blue Mounds for Fish Fry you know exactly what it is. Overall, we highly, highly recommend this Fish Fry and think it serves as a shining example of everything Friday night in Wisconsin stands for - tasty food, friendly folks, and dedication to a craft. This is clearly one of the best Fish Frys in the Madison area, and well likely be making the trek to Blue Mounds more frequently from here on out. We loved every minute and every morsel of this Fish Fry which is really what its all about. www.hootervilleinnwi.com10992 Division StreetBlue Mounds, WI 53517     (608) 437-5444",3947,0.2305942334739803,0.530356138235885

Obviously, boat loads of fish comes to mind, but some might say getting out of the house, or taking the night off from cooking. While others might say friendship, camaraderie, and relaxing with loved ones after a long week at work. Whatever the case may be, whether you are in it for fish or for the friends, Aunt Mary has you covered. Her Hooterville Inn is all about Fish Fry. Our crew of five piled into Gabes silver boat, set sail, and arrived in the port of Bluemounds roughly 30 minutes later.  Finding Hooterville was no problem since it was about the only place with a crowd in the homey hamlet. The place was plenty busy, but we wiggled into a cranny at the bar, grabbed some Cows, and within another 30 minutes had the five stools we needed. At this point we took our name off the list and just ordered at the bar since we figured it would have been another half hour wait based on our original estimate. As luck would have it, no sooner was our name removed from the tablature than a big table opened up and the group who sauntered in after us was escorted to it. Oh well, no biggie We all came to Bluemonds for fish, and that is exactly what everyone ordered, although quantities varied within the group. No one wussed-out with the $7 1-piece, but a bunch of $9 2-pieces went into the queue, as did my $11 3-piece. It took a good 15 minutes for the food to arrive since there were a few orders in front ours, but the fish was ungodly hot when it did.I wasted no time, snagging one of the piping hot pieces right away, and seeing what was what. The view was simply phenomenal. The cod was incredibly light and flaky, and almost melted in your mouth. The luxurious liquefaction was aided by the dark colored Spotted Cow beer batter which was equally delicate and worked perfectly with cod. The enchanting chunks went down with ease, leaving me wishing a 5-piece (or AYCE) option would have been on the table. This was some of the best beer battered cod we have ever eaten, and can easily say its in the same echelon as the Owls Nest.Slathering the cod was Aunt Marys homemade tartar sauce which lives in a big squeeze bottle on the counter. While we would certainly prefer it to be chilled, the mayo-based mix still did its job, and took the cod up a notch.Usually we just go for the French fries, but after catching a glimpse of the plain crinkle-cuts on a fellow diners plate we thought better of it. We asked the bartender what she thought about our pending decision, and she wholeheartedly endorsed their homemade baby reds. Being the ever-present dissenter, I took yet another path, and chose the hash browns with cheese and onions. They sported crispy exteriors and, soft supple interiors, just like mom would make. The cheese and onion were in perfect balance resulting in a classic taste. The few of us who took the bartenders suggestion and chose the baby reds were also not disappointed as the quartered spuds were drown in butter and what appeared to be some sort of pesto.A final duet was sung by a slice of dark rye, and some homemade Hooter slaw. Aunt Marys coleslaw was very good, and had just the right hint of zest. Its sweet and smooth sensation serenaded the radical rye, and quelled its signature bite perfectly.Even though we chose to sit at the bar the service didnt suffer one bit. The bartenders, cook, and hostess worked in concert, and ran this Fish Fry as a finely tuned machine. They kept Aunt Marys pedal to the metal, and made for a truly inspiring Friday night experience.

In particular, I have a couple that work for Zendesk (look them up if you want to know what they do) whose office is right down on the square. When one of them pinged me and asked if I'd be interested in some fish and a tour of their swanky office space I jumped at the chance. When he suggested we go to the Tipsy Cow for lunch beforehand it sealed the deal.I hadn't been to the Tipsy for lunch for a few years and this visit made me remember what I was missing. The Cow has cod and walleye on Fridays and for $10 the cod is a steal. The walleye also checks the ""How is this possible?"" box since it's only $12 and appears to be the real deal. The TC doesn't mess around and produce fish with a flavorful and bountiful beer batter. As expected, the batter works best on the cod with its smoky flavor and creamy texture. It's rich and inviting and as decadent as they come. The fish itself was of good quality and had me wondering why in the world it had been so damn long since last I came down to the Cow. Fries come with the fish and are satisfactory and not as abundant as you'd assume. Luckily, the have a crispy batter that does the deed and supplements the fish admirably. Some thin and kind of skunky tartar comes along for the ride and by itself would make for a very lackluster sauce experience. Thankfully, the always impressive Tipsy Sauce picks up its slack and takes things to a wholenother level with it smoky chipotle flavor. The namesake sauce makes the (crummy by comparison) homemade tartar 100% obsolete. Traditional Frys come with rye and the Tipsy is one of the few places in town that take this tradition seriously. The slab was fresh and crusty and offset the potent pink slaw perfectly. The Tispy recently opened a new location in the Prairie Lakes development outside of Sun Prairie and since I work very close to the I can hardly wait to give it a shot. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and think the Tipsy is a cash cow if ever there was one. www.tipsycowmadison.com102 King StreetMadison, WI 53703     (608) 287-1455",2118,0.14915076085530635,0.48048570116751943

In Wisconsin we can add one more to that list: your favorite Fish Fry place is going to be packed on the first Friday of Lent. This year I went to the Tipsy Cow on the inaugural Friday, and as expected, they were swamped. The wait for a table approached an hour and a half, but luckily for me I was rolling solo and got a spot at the bar about 15 minutes after I got there (and felt pretty good about it). Once I got the spot everything went swimmingly (although they did forget the slice of rye). My fish came about 10 minutes after I ordered and was steaming hot. As expected, the cod was really good. It featured a nice, light beer batter with a smooth flavor. The fish itself was flaky and came in a decent portion (probably around 9 ounces total). I gleefully dunked the fish in both the delicious Tipsy sauce and improved tartar sauce that accompanied it, often at the same time. The aforementioned Tipsy sauce is interesting and features a subtle smoky, chipotle flavor, while the updated tartar is smooth and creamy with just enough dill to keep things interesting. The sauces went blow for blow with each other until all fish and fries were exhausted, and while I appreciated the improved tartar, the Tipsy sauce is still where its at. The Tipsy slaw was also uniquely delicious and featured a pinkish hue similar to the specialty sauce. Yum. Since there was no bread, the last thing on the plate was a handful of battered fries which were simply delicious. The allotment was adequate, and each individual featured a great crunch, and supple center. They lasted until the fish was gone, but not much longer. Im not really afraid to die, and, unlike a lot of people, I dont have a huge problem paying my taxes. Whats more, I dont mind having a beer or two at the bar while I wait for my Fish Fry, and totally expect that will be the case on the first Friday of Lent. Its simply an inevitability you have to deal with and nothing to get worked up over especially when a fantastic Fish Fry is your reward. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and have to say that the Tipsy Cow has come a long way over the years. www.tipsycowmadison.com102 King StreetMadison, WI 53703     (608) 287-1455",2268,0.22554421768707492,0.5359961127308064

Fish Fry fans are a fickle bunch and even one bad piece can turn the most loyal patron into former supporter. Thus, it is important to make sure everything is the same on each and every visit. Consistency counts.The Tipsy Cow recently remodeled their Friday Fish, and seemed to have it all figured out. Their beer battered cod morphed from a frizzy, crumbly mess into a rich and delectable delight. We quickly sang their praises since the batter was so flavorful and their Tipsy Sauce so unique. We knew it wouldnt be long before we returned for another round, hoping it would be every bit as perfect as our last visit. It was close, but not quite flawless.While the cod still boasted the same flavorful beer batter, and came lighting quick once we actually ordered, one piece was slightly over-fried, while another was dramatically over-fried  not to the point of fizzling off mind you, but not far from it. This ugly duckling was far too crispy, and fried so deep and so long that the fish underneath actually started to wilt and get chewy. The other two chunks were much better which allowed the lush Spotted Cow infused coating shine. When fried right, this batter has a great flavor that doesnt totally mask the flaky fish underneath. It is a real treat when done this way, and while wed prefer perfection, I guess two outta three aint bad. Somewhat making up for the over-fried fella was a boatload of battered fries. The Julienne-cut spuds were superb, and sported a crispy coating that melded effortlessly with the supple potato innards. Yum.The signature Tipsy Sauce also had a serious yum factor, and paired nicely with the two well-fried pieces. The chipotle-infused goodness even did its best to cover up the over-fried one, but the crispy critter was still a little too powerful to be caged. Some homemade tartar also came along for the journey, but was way too dilly and runny. Bolstering what is already a stellar lineup was the homemade Tipsy slaw, and a FULL SLICE of Clasens rye bread. The slaw featured the Cows signature pinkish hue, and was very sweet and creamy, although it does leave plenty of slaw water when all is said and done. The rye was lightly toasted, but heavily delicious when slathered with the pat of room temperature butter the Tipsy provides. While perfect fish is almost impossible to find, consistently good fish isnt. There are many places that have fry time down to a science and while the TC is close they havent quite gotten it just yet. Overall, we still highly recommend this Fish Fry and figure that one over-fried piece is forgivable... for now. www.tipsycowmadison.com102 King StreetMadison, WI 53703     (608) 287-1455",2782,0.17267269253380368,0.5481202233980013

The fish on this initial journey wasnt very good, but we vowed to give them a chance to redeem themselves. Well, we didnt wait quite long enough and found ourselves in a classic fool me once fool me twice scenario. After being burned by the bovine a second time we swore not to come back until we heard things had changed for good. It took a year and half, but we finally heard the good word. Even though we arrived late, the square-side hotspot was jam packed - 9:30 means nothing in these parts. As luck would have it, one of bar-adjacent high top tables opened up right as we walked in, and the hostess had it ready for us in no time. We had a good 10 minutes to peruse the menu as we waited for our waiter who eventually noticed we had taken up residence and came to grab our orders. The Cows kitchen was clearly moving, and we had our food in no time. Everything was blazing hot, looked stupendous, and smelled absolutely amazing. I simply couldnt resist the allure, and tore into the plate, starting with the cod. This fish was so much better than the cod of the past that it wasnt even comparable. The new beer batter was creamy and sumptuous without a drop of grease to be seen. It was incredibly tasty and had some cumin and/or chili powder that really perked it up. It melded marvelously with the flaky cod underneath, and while it was great on its own, it was even better with a shot of tipsy sauce (thats right, tipsy, not tartar). Dont be fooled, the Tipsy Cow does give you tartar with your Fish Fry, but its a thin homemade blend that is a too heavy on the pickle flavor. While it would get you by in a pinch its far from ideal, and nowhere near as good as the sauce that supplements it. The signature tipsy sauce that also comes with the Fish Fry blesses everything it touches, especially the spicy chunks of cod. The pink wonder is just brilliant, and has a smoky, chipotle undertone that is very memorable. The half of the plate not covered in fish was home to a handful of house-cut French fries. The salty spuds were very good, but took a back seat to the flavorful fish. The portion was on the small side, but it was manageable and I somehow made them last until the end. Since the fish on our first couple trips was downright bad it left the door open for the slaw to steal the show  and steal the show it did. The cool brew was clearly homemade, with a creamy sweetness and a little zest (but not too much). The same slaw is still being served with the Friday special and while it didnt steal the show this time around it is still as delicious as ever. The Cow tries to keep things classy with a slice of Clasens rye, but while we appreciated the tiny toast, the half-slice they give you is so tiny and almost seems like a joke. Two bites is not quite right.Now this is what we anticipated when the Tipsy Cow opened their doors back in 2011. The atmosphere was lively, the fish was uniquely delicious, and the rest of the food was great as well. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry, and would have to say its currently one of the best the downtown Madison has to offer. www.tipsycowmadison.com102 King StreetMadison, WI 53703     (608) 287-1455",3298,0.21735639360639367,0.47503690753690747

In all fairness, you havent given us much to write aboutThis was our second trip to the Tipsy, and likely our last (unless we hear through the grapevine that some changes are made). Much like our first visit everything was a bit off and not quite worth our nine bucks.The cod contained the same wispy batter that was fried to the point of crumbling/dissolving, and just not very tasty. While it wasnt burned, it was pretty close to it and most of the dark brown coating fizzled into crumbs. The underlying fish was flaky, but died a slow death in its batter casket. As the fish lacked flavor, the fries lacked abundance, and only a small handful of the thick, Julienne-cuts made the plate. While they tasted good, there werent simply enough of them to salvage the sinking ship. Perhaps the only reason the fish got eaten was the two unique sauces that trailed it. One was the Tipsy tartar which was needed in spades. The dry fish practically begged for thin sauce, which hosted all sorts of green god-only-knows-what. Some pinky Tipsy sauce filled out the duo and while it was nice to have, it couldnt fully fix the frazzled fish.The best part of the meal (if there was one) was the small half-slice of Classens toasted rye which was highlighted with a pat of room temperature butter. While we only give them a score of good for the breathtaking bread, it solely reflects the diminutive portion and not the quality in any way. Pink and zesty, the coleslaw gave the rye a run for its money. It was a vinegar/cream mix thats as easy on the tasted buds as it is on the eyes. Equally appealing was the lovely weather on the Capitol-adjacent terrace and the speedy service that had us in and out in around 30 minutes. Unfortunately, attractive ambiance and wonderful waitresses do not a Fish Fry make. There is a lot to like about the Tipsy Cow, and numerous reviewers have given their burgers, curds and other pub-fare the thumbs-up. Unfortunately, the deliciousness of their burgers is not reflected by their fish, and the Friday special is not something we feel confident recommending at this time. www.tipsycowmadison.com102 King StreetMadison, WI 53703     (608) 287-1455",2302,0.16411960132890366,0.561544850498339

Were not exactly sure why, but whatever it is, the lure of the unknown is unavoidable. Perhaps it was the prime downtown location, or the bovine inspired moniker that drew us in, but whatever the cause, we clearly made our trip to The Tipsy Cow for Fish Fry before they had a chance to work out the kinks. Jer, Julia and I arrived at the former King & Mane establishment just as the lunch hour kicked off and were escorted directly to one of the high-top tables overlooking a surprisingly dormant King Street. When the waitress came over we wasted no time throwing three Fish Fry orders at her along with an order of curds which Julia insisted upon (perhaps MadisonCheeseCurds.com is in the works? Ive heard rumblings)The curds came as an appetizer, and were clearly not the standard Sysco freezer fare. They were adorned with a Spotted Cow batter that practically glowed as the fluffy whey companion stated their case for the curd crown. They were very good, and in the experts opinion, a top 3 in the Mad-City. Before we even exhausted our basket of curdish delights, the fish arrived and our attention shifted.For nine bucks the Cow provides 3 smallish pieces of cod, a diminutive portion of fries, some tartar to perk them up, homemade slaw, and a real piece of rye bread. Like the curds, the Tipsy Cow batters their cod in Spotted Cow, however, unlike the well-fried curds, the cod was over-fried and tasted burned. The extra time in the fryer led to the batter being way too crispy, to the point where it disintegrated into a fine powder. It was too bad because the cod underneath seemed to be high quality, but its flakiness was lost to its dark, over-fried crust.The fish didnt reach its potential, nor did the thin, julienne-style fries. Although they did have a battered feel (which I really like), the portion was miniscule and with the charred cod not cutting the mustard the small share wasnt enough to save the ship. Due to the fact the fish was singed it was a bit difficult to get an accurate bead on the tartar situation, but we can safely say that the thin mix missed the mark. It definitely housed more dill than relish, and was paired with their Tipsy Sauce which had a pinkish hue, and an indescribable taste. Unfortunately, the burned flavor of the cod was just too strong and it wouldnt have mattered if they gave us two sauces, or ten, nothing would have been able overtake it. Pairing well visually with the Tipsy Sauce was a pile of homemade electric pink slaw. It had a nice sweet, vinegar taste, and was really good. Its zestiness also complimented the slice of thick-cut toasted Clasens rye on the side very well. While the food needed some tweaking the service was running on all cylinders, and they had us in and out in around 40 minutes; not too bad for a lunch on The Square, if I do say so myself. We just cant recommend their Fish Fry at this time, but will likely come back in a couple months when theyve had a chance to settle into the groove. Fish Fry isnt a joke, and it takes time to master the subtle nuances that separate the best from the rest. I think they can do it, and when they do well have no problem giving them the MFF seal of approval, but until then, they are going to have to hitch up their pants and get to work. www.tipsycowmadison.com102 King StreetMadison, WI 53703     (608) 287-1455",3468,0.05502435064935066,0.47881132756132766

They point to this fact as one of the main reasons why these local institutions are falling by the wayside in favor of TV-laden sports bars and other modern style establishments. While we cant help but agree with this assessment, it is with some reservation that we do. You see, Madison Fish Fry isnt exactly what youd call a flock of spring chickens, but then again, were not a bunch of salty old dogs either. While we fall somewhere between young bucks and aged cheddar, we dont necessarily look the part of a seasoned Fish Fry critics. Being that we dont fit the mold of your traditional supper club diners, we are no strangers to the discrimination that younger folks frequently encounter on Friday nights. And you can take it from The Fry Guys, the bias does exist.We knew about the Buckhorn Supper Club long before the delightful documentary highlighted their Lobster Boil, but since it is quite a ways away from Madison (at least relatively) we never took the hour-long trip to rural Milton. Well, after watching the flick, we were powerless to resist the draw of the Koshkonong-adjacent eatery and took the first available Friday to pay them a visit. We arrived about 7:00 and to no ones surprise were given the 45 wait routine  fair enough. Luckily, we snaked a bar side table from a group whose name was just called, eventually got the bartenders attention, grabbed some drinks, and prepared ourselves fish. Three beers, and pushing an hour and a half later, just as the sun was setting over beautiful Lake Wisconsin and the bar was totally thinned out, our name was called and we were led to the once densely packed patio, now sparsely populated. We were one of, if not the last, groups of the evening (even though we were far from the last to arrive, mind you). We were seated and had plenty of time to drink in the superb view of the lake. After about five minutes of imbibing the beauty, our young waitress finally ambled over and sensing that we were ready, immediately jumped into her spiel. She ran through a bunch of specials, my veggie wife eagerly hanging on every word hoping for some sort of non-meat miracle. Unfortunately, a veggie vision was nowhere to be seen, but she wound up being more than happy with the Bruschetta and salad she did get. As for the fish, after a couple back-to-back weeks of so-so offerings I was ready for the $15 AYCE cod, casting the $13.50 3-piece, and $12.50 2-piece aside. Jer decided to branch out and go for the half chicken half fish combo, which seemed sage, but that would prove to be costly. Before the fish, some delicious homemade coleslaw and mini bread loafs made the rounds. The slaw was smooth and creamy featuring just enough zing to tickle taste buds while the soft rolls balanced its zest nicely. The duo did their part, laying down the perfect foundation for the unending fish that was to come. The entrées arrived about 8:45, just as the sun dipped below the horizon. As soon as she set my plate down she asked if I wanted to re-up (a sure fire sign of a good AYCE Fish Fry) which I, of course, did - requesting an additional three pieces. She scurried away to drop the order by the kitchen leaving in such haste that Jer couldnt even inform her that she had mistakenly brought him ALL chicken and no fish. Boy, was he steamed by her oversight. I did what I could by offering him a piece of my scalding hot cod, but even that gesture couldnt ease his pain. Its really too bad he got that bad taste in his mouth because the cod was actually quite good. It was nice and flaky, but as he was sure to point out, a little dry. I didnt think it was overly dry and while the first round (which he tried) wasnt necessarily moist, the second round (which he didnt) was. The light and flaky breading was consistent on both rounds, peeled off effortlessly, and had a slight hint of spice. While it could have used a bit more flavor, it was still above average, and I had no problem putting away every piece afforded me.A small stack of classic supper club style French fries accompanied the fish. The thick steak fries were well fried, and even though the portion was tiny, they were acceptable. A lot of times AYCE fries will accompany the AYCE fish, but I forgot to ask for more the one time the waitress came back. Jer was less enthusiastic about the fries and pretty much poo-pooed them, but I chalk it up to him being overly critical due to the fish fiasco he endured. Topping off the cod was the Buckhorns homemade tartar sauce. It had the proper proportion of mayo to relish, and made the fish even better. Whats more, the Horn stores their sauce in an outdoor cooler on the patio making retrieval of additional cups easy, even for the slowest of waitresses. Speaking of the young lady who took our orders and brought our check, that is about all she did. She certainly didnt go out of her way to make us feel welcome, and even though she was in and out of the restaurant many, many times, she never once stopped by during the meal to see how we were doing, save for the time she dropped off my second plate of fish. It kind of made us feel invisible, and only added to unwelcoming timbre of the evening.While I know what Jers opinion is, I would still recommend the AYCE Fish Fry at the Buckhorn as I personally liked everything except the service and the fact we didnt feel really wanted. The food was good, the view was spectacular, and ambiance of the supper club shined despite the sideways glances, and subtle disdain.Look, we love supper clubs, and will continue to partonize them as long as they are around. Sure, we dont always receive the best service, and were not sure what the basis for the discrimination is, but we can safely assume its because we simply dont look the part. Yes, we dont drive Buicks, or have grey hair, and no, we dont order Old Fashioneds, or wear flannel shirts out to dinner, but does that mean were not good tippers or somehow dont appreciate a good Fish Fry? Hell no. We are the next generation of supper club diners, and we love you.

June 3rd  The first visit, everything was stellar. We thought we hit the jackpot. June 17th  Our return visit only two weeks later, everything was less than stellar. We had a fine lunch, but the house definitely won.  June 3rd  Had the $7 2-piece which actually worked out to 4 small pieces. June 17th  Cod was so good last time, went for the 3-piece which, as you might expect, worked out to 6 small pieces. June 3rd  The cod was incredibly light and airy. It was smooth and delicious, and paired with a fantastic breading. The idyllic crust was perfectly spiced, with plenty of pepper evident in the mix. June 17th  Cod was almost identical. It had the same breading, although it seemed like the spice was dialed back a notch. Like a fortnight prior the fish was thin, flaky and very well fried. The breading was still the star even if it did fall off the fish from time to time. June 3rd  No fries were served, it is a café after all, so I let em slide with the baked potato. Since it is still a potato product it wasnt the end of the world, but the standard baked potato with a blob of sour cream left a little something to be desired. June 17th  Leaving even more to be desired was the bland rice and carrots mix that we received this time around. It was basically plain white rice and had absolutely no taste. It was a major let down and actually had me wishing for that baked potato. Sad.  June 3rd  The great fish was paired with a fantastic tartar which made it all the more delectable. The Medium-thick sauce had a dense mayo base cut with a good amount of relish (and possibly some other stuff). June 17th  The tartar continued its domination with its zesty mayo and just the right amount of relish. My ramekin was totally empty by meals end. June 3rd  The coleslaw came in a big old coffee cup and was clearly homemade. It was a clean, dry blend but while it wasnt swimming in goo it wasnt arid either. It tasted good like a good slaw should. June 17th  The slaw strayed and left us all wondering what happened. This batch didnt have much flavor, and while it had a very light zest, and still looked homemade, it was nowhere near as good as the last time. June 3rd  TNTs has a bunch of pastries for sale so its no surprise that the roll was great. It appeared to be some sort of wheat, but it actually tasted more like a donut. It was very good and served with a lavish amount of room temperature whipped butter. June 17th  More of the same as far as gluten is concerned. Delicious, delicious gluten.  June 3rd  This turned out to be a great meal for just trying it on a whim. The fish was superb and coupled with and equally transcendent tartar which made for a near-perfect lunch. This Fish Fry was easily highly recommendable, and convinced us to come back not but two weeks later. June 17th  This certainly wasnt the same Fish Fry we had last time, what with the rice and all, but at the end of the day, the fish, tartar and roll got the job done. Overall, we would barely recommend TNTs Fish Fry based on this visit, and the lower score does pull their overall average down into plain, old recommendable territory. What have we learned about TNTs? First, and probably foremost, we have learned that rice has no place in a Fish Fry. Secondly, we have fortified our resolve that the unsung hero of the Fish Fry is the ubiquitous, but largely unheralded, French fried potato. Third, we have realized that a coffee place CAN actually make a good Fish Fry, how consistently they can make it is a different issue, but they definitely CAN make it. And lastly, we have learned that its a bad idea to whole heartedly endorse a restaurant based on one glowing experience. When it comes to the total Fish Fry experience consistency counts, and a second visit to a place might paint a different picture... maybe even one with rice in it. 729 North High Point RoadMadison, WI 53717     (608) 831-2298",4001,0.14760435038212819,0.39102880658436234

It had the same breading, although it seemed like the spice was dialed back a notch. Like a fortnight prior the fish was thin, flaky and very well fried. The breading was still the star even if it did fall off the fish from time to time. June 3rd  No fries were served, it is a café after all, so I let em slide with the baked potato. Since it is still a potato product it wasnt the end of the world, but the standard baked potato with a blob of sour cream left a little something to be desired. June 17th  Leaving even more to be desired was the bland rice and carrots mix that we received this time around. It was basically plain white rice and had absolutely no taste. It was a major let down and actually had me wishing for that baked potato. Sad.  June 3rd  The great fish was paired with a fantastic tartar which made it all the more delectable. The Medium-thick sauce had a dense mayo base cut with a good amount of relish (and possibly some other stuff). June 17th  The tartar continued its domination with its zesty mayo and just the right amount of relish. My ramekin was totally empty by meals end. June 3rd  The coleslaw came in a big old coffee cup and was clearly homemade. It was a clean, dry blend but while it wasnt swimming in goo it wasnt arid either. It tasted good like a good slaw should. June 17th  The slaw strayed and left us all wondering what happened. This batch didnt have much flavor, and while it had a very light zest, and still looked homemade, it was nowhere near as good as the last time. June 3rd  TNTs has a bunch of pastries for sale so its no surprise that the roll was great. It appeared to be some sort of wheat, but it actually tasted more like a donut. It was very good and served with a lavish amount of room temperature whipped butter. June 17th  More of the same as far as gluten is concerned. Delicious, delicious gluten.  June 3rd  This turned out to be a great meal for just trying it on a whim. The fish was superb and coupled with and equally transcendent tartar which made for a near-perfect lunch. This Fish Fry was easily highly recommendable, and convinced us to come back not but two weeks later. June 17th  This certainly wasnt the same Fish Fry we had last time, what with the rice and all, but at the end of the day, the fish, tartar and roll got the job done. Overall, we would barely recommend TNTs Fish Fry based on this visit, and the lower score does pull their overall average down into plain, old recommendable territory. What have we learned about TNTs? First, and probably foremost, we have learned that rice has no place in a Fish Fry. Secondly, we have fortified our resolve that the unsung hero of the Fish Fry is the ubiquitous, but largely unheralded, French fried potato. Third, we have realized that a coffee place CAN actually make a good Fish Fry, how consistently they can make it is a different issue, but they definitely CAN make it. And lastly, we have learned that its a bad idea to whole heartedly endorse a restaurant based on one glowing experience. When it comes to the total Fish Fry experience consistency counts, and a second visit to a place might paint a different picture... maybe even one with rice in it. 729 North High Point RoadMadison, WI 53717     (608) 831-2298",4001,0.14760435038212819,0.39102880658436234

Since Im not a big grouper guy I bypassed the Super Combo which contains all three pan-fried styles and settled on the regular combo of walleye and perch. It was ready lickety-split and I had at it. For $11.50 my combo came with two nice sized perch fillets and two small walleye chunks. The perch was good, and looked just like its picture on Milwaukee Fish Fry List. The breading was crunchy, extremely spicy, and a little over the top to be frank (this coming from someone who likes spicy breading, mind you). The actual fish was firm, and only slightly flaky. It was hard to tell if the toughness was the result of poor quality fish or the hearty breading since the coating was so strong it basically took it over all it touched. The walleye did fare slightly better however, as the thicker cut held its own against the brawny breading allowing the fish to maintain more of its inherent flakiness. Overall, both fish were decent, but the walleye outpaced the perch in the long run. Doing everything it could to stack up to the breading was McBobs homemade tartar. Unfortunately, even the thick, mayo-rich blend couldnt make a dent in the spicy sheath and was basically unnoticeable. Much more in your face were the homemade potato pancakes which were quite good, but not generously portioned. The two small cakes were well fried with crispy edges giving way to smooth evenly-cooked middles.

Yes, Cartographers (map makers) do still exist and have a relatively robust industry thanks to the advent of GIS (computer-based mapping software). As a mapping professional I had the opportunity to become certified in GIS and as part of that certification I needed to pass an exam. None of this has anything to do with Fish Frys per se, except for the fact that when I needed a place to sit and study on the Friday night before my Saturday morning exam I chose KD's Bar and Grill in Lodi, and they have damn good fish.I needed a quiet place, so of course I chose KD's, right? Obviously, that's not true. KD's is a bustling bar and silence isn't the reason I chose it. I picked KD's since I had an inkling that I'd be able to get a spot at the spacious bar, settle in, and do my thing. And regardless of how focused I'd be, I'd get some great fish and have a good time doing it. The bartenders at KD's are crackerjack so I knew they take care of business and I wouldn't have to worry about that aspect of the meal at all. I got my spot, ordered a drink, studied my stuff, ordered my perch, studied some more, ate it up, and studied a bit more after dinner. I left feeling smarter all around. KD's ""big perch"" is a buck or so more than it used to be but it's still a square deal. The EIGHT real fillets are home to a dry and crumbly breading with a superb flavor. And don't take ""dry"" the wrong way, this is the best kind of dryness you can hope for - grease free, but with moist meat underneath. It's a dynamic flavor combination, like a McDonald's fry in a chocolate shake. Most everything about this Fish Fry is extraordinary, but the fries lack a little something. Yes, there is a sour cream and chive version I've had in the past, but in my experience they are no more than on par with the regular which are...well..regular. Of course, they are still well fried and the portion is gigundo so there is really not much to complain about. KD's tartar is there for the taking and take I did. It comes is a massive squeeze bottle and a couple/three ounces made its way out on squirt one, and was easily replicated on the next go-round. It's a beefy blend that really makes the already amazing fish something more. It's a twisted love affair and one I'm glad to partake in. A slab of rye on the side gets love from me although they'll appease the less daring among us with a white option. The slaw is universal and the 4 ounce cup overflows with creamy and inviting goodness, while a second 4 ouncer secures a batch of ooey gooey baked beans. Both sides get high marks from me and make for a full Fish Fry experience a lot of places can't or simply don't replicate. Taking tests, especially when you're 38 years old, can seem like a daunting affair, but the Fish Fry at KD's helped to put my mind at ease and remind me that there are more important things in the world like friends, family, and Fish Fry. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry whether you're just looking for a way to jump start the weekend or a (not so) quiet spot to study. It's one of the best around...and oh, yeah, I passed the test. No sweat.  kdsbarandgrill.com/N1434 Fair StreetLodi, WI 53555     (608) 592-4696",3238,0.22016468253968255,0.4834685592185591

From the Lake Wisconsin lot to those in town, there really isn't a bad one in the bunch. I'm always glad to take the drive up that way and especially glad when we land at KD's.The lake perch at KD's is a force to be reckoned with and comes as a nice 5-piece or a big, bad 8-piece. Perch aren't huge so the 8-piece always seems reasonable (at least to me) and I went that route yet again. We showed up late this week, but the kitchen was still humming at 7:30 so it took a moment for the fish to find us. The eight fillets were strewn across the plate and didn't look the prettiest, but then again, they didn't have to. These babies were the real deal yellow perch a highlighted by a crunchy, well-seasoned breading. The execution is essentially flawless, resulting in what is literally some of the tastiest perch out there. There aren't a ton of sides to choose from on Fridays at KD's, but the fries are always a reasonable choice. They come a couple different ways and this time we went for the sour cream and chive version, which are unique, but could use a little more oomph. While I'm not sure what more would entail, they could use a little bit of whatever it is. The regular rendition are battered and crisp, and basically go tit-for-tat with sour cream and chive version. A whole bottle of nozzle-clogging tartar sits at each table and is a force to be reckoned with. It's a thick mix, and we had to force chunks of relish through the opening on numerous occasions, but the big creamer did the deed. It forces you to take notice with it's superb taste that pairs perfectly with the heavily-seasoned perch. It's a beaut, and the force is definitely strong with this one. A thick and creamy slaw and a bonus cup of baked beans come on the side and make the perfect accompaniment for the fantastic fish. KD also pairs real rye with their fish which so few places do in this day and age that it almost makes me weep. There must be something in the water in Lodi. Each and every cook up that way seems to have Fish Fry down to a science, and the cooks at KD's are no exception. In fact, their lake perch is the best of the bunch and is the crown jewel amongst all the treasures. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and think it just doesn't get much better than this. kdsbarandgrill.com/N1434 Fair StreetLodi, WI 53555     (608) 592-4696",2384,0.20994949494949494,0.5517735042735042

Sure, you hafta drive a little bit to get up there, but if you want some of the best fish in the area isn't it worth it? I think it is...KD's has plenty of options on Fridays, but for me it's the $15.00 8-piece perch or nothing. Yes, 8-piece! Of course, you can get less, but if you're like me and you love fish, why would you? This is basically a perfect Fish Fry. The eight perch are the real deal, and the fillets are large. These babies are home to a light breading that clings like the dickins and tastes like heaven. There is also no grease, no mess, and no regrets despite the massive portion. This stuff is the best. The basic fries are basic (is that redundant?), but fried every bit as well as the fish (which is a compliment). A big squeeze bottle of tartar (that keeps you coming back for more) is so thick and creamy it's surprising that you can even get it out the nozzle. This stuff bathes the perch in benevolence and could easily be eaten with a spoon all by itself. The last items on the plate are a nice slice of marble rye (or plain old roll if that's your preference), and a scoop of slaw with plenty of pop. The slaw is nothing really unique per se, and the rye is as traditional as it gets, but they basically allow the perch to take all the glory here - which is exactly how it should be. KD's is clearly the local hot spot and the raucous atmosphere proves as much. Regardless, the service is always fast and friendly, and the fish is out of this world. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and think it is everything a small town Fish Fry should be and probably a lot more.

However, they are apparently also the perfect setting for Fish Fry discussions, and what you learn during these talks often provides actionable items for future Fridays.The Spring Creek Tavern in Lodi has been closed for quite some time now, but during their run they produced some of the best fried fish that small town has seen. Well, thanks to the aforementioned BBQ banter, we recently learned that KDs Bar & Grill had acquired the famous SCT recipe and began serving their own rendition of the Friday classic (for both lunch and dinner, no less). Being that we are always looking for new lunchtime hot spots, I took the first available opportunity and paid KDs a visit. What I found wasnt exactly the Spring Creek, but was pretty damn good.KDs resides on the North Side of Lodi, just past the fairgrounds (turn by the Mobil). The bar is massive, clean, and very well laid out. I pulled up to one of the open stools at the bar and within 10 seconds the bartender came right over. A Cow and a Fish Fry was all it took, as he stepped away, got me an icy glass from the cooler, filled it up, and passed the order to the two ladies manning the visible kitchen. They took the interruption in stride, one continued prepping the daily special - filling cups of tartar, making coleslaw, and the like  the other stepped to the fryer, freshly breaded cod in hand. The fish fried and was ready for me in three minutes, but sat at the serving counter for a couple more as the line of communication between cook and keep failed. Regardless of the brief delay, it was served in pristine condition, still stunningly hot. I dove in instantly only to pull a dragon, immediately exhaling an immense plume of steam - it was a truly a thing of beauty. I hammered down the first of the two pieces in mere seconds, breathing fire the entire time. This cod was just too good to wait for. The fish itself was 100% clean white meat which flaked apart effortlessly. The two generous sized pieces were totally greaseless and complimented by the Spring Creeks light breading. The hand-me-down recipe featured a nice hint of spice, which, when combined with the flavor of the fish, made for an idyllic, almost Tobys-like, experience. The fridge-fresh tartar made the steaming fish more manageable especially when slathered on generously. The homemade looking sauce had a thick mayo base, with a very nice proportion of relish, and what seemed to be a hint of cinnamon and/or nutmeg. It was quite good, as were the bevy of battered French fries that also made the journey. The matchstick style fries were perfectly fried, to the point where their reddish-orange exteriors practically glowed under KDs neon. I know I saw the ladies in the kitchen filling cups of coleslaw, but what I dont remember is if it was coming out of a big tub or a Sysco jug. Either way, homemade or distributed, the traditional creamy mix was right in the zone, but not mind-blowing. It also didnt blow my mind that KDs doesnt give you a roll with your $7 lunch Fish Fry since so many places seem to cut that corner in this day and age. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry, and will be back some day soon. My hat is off to the the Spring Creek Tavern for their generosity in doing what they can to keep this wonderful Fish Fry recipe alive. We can only hope that KDs will expand their offerings into the freshwater realm like their predecessor did, but even if they decide to just stick with the cod that will be okay too. Usually a hand-me-down is less than desirable, but in the case of KD's Fish Fry recipe it's actually quite delicious.kdsbarandgrill.com/N1434 Fair StreetLodi, WI 53555     (608) 592-4696",3808,0.17983395733395732,0.5046345696345697

It turns out Nelsons Crossing - in lovely Deansville - isnt one to skimp on the portions, and if youre willing to take the drive you are almost assured to leave with leftovers. While their Fish Fry isnt All You Can Eat, it might as well be since they deliver more food to your table than any one individual should probably consume in a single sitting but we did it anyway at least, one of us did...  We crossed the tracks on Berlin Road and landed at the grimy country bar (and restaurant?) around 7pm, right at the height of the frying hour. The bar was swamped, but a few open tables dotted the dining room/converted dance floor so we just grabbed a big one near the kitchen and snagged a pitcher from the bar. The menus were waiting in the condiment bin at the table and displayed the Friday (and Wednesday!) specials. The Crossing basically offers all of the traditional Fish Fry fish: cod, haddock, lake perch, bluegill, walleye, and smelt, but they even branch out further adding the likes of: frog legs, jumbo shrimp, lobster chunks and calamari. We didnt get to sample anything on the secondary list, but since there were four of us we did get to try everything on the first lest except for the walleye, and let me tell you, everything was delicious.Our waitress made contact initially, but since the menu was so expansive we werent exactly raring to go, and asked for a little time to study it. This turned out to be a bad choice. She buzzed off, waited on some other people, bussed a table or two, and by the time we could get her attention again nearly 15 minutes had passed. Thankfully, once she did take our orders and got them in, everything came like clockwork.Thanks to some quick thinkin by Jer our appetizer of smelt hit the table first even though it wasnt listed as an app on the menu (it always pays to ask, I guess). The lone plate was piled high with what had to be 35-40 individual smelt, and flanked by a couple cups of tartar. It was nuts. These little guys were coated in a fine dusting of breading and fried to sheer perfection. They were absolutely delicious, but there was no telling Gabe that. The look that came over his face when he saw the full fish bodies was priceless. He looked nauseated, and you could almost see his stomach turn at the thought of eating one.Before Jer and I could scale smelt mountain the main course hit the table, and we realized exactly what we were up against. Each of the four plates was piled high with a fantastic amount of fish, piles of potatoes, tubs of tartar sauce, a regular roll, and a seemingly out of place cutsie cups of coleslaw. My plate in particular housed about eight huge bluegill fillets which were much thicker than average and incredibly meaty. Like the smelt it had a light breading which was flaky as can be, but could have used a hint more spice. Even so, it was utterly delicious and not overly fishy; hell, compared to the smelt it almost tasted mild. The bluegill portion was plenty, but we did our due diligence and made sure to try the rest of the options floating around the table. Jers lake perch was also quite scrumptious, but the pieces were actually smaller than the bluegill, which seems a little backwards, but whatever. Roughly five butterflies fluttered across his plate, resulting in 10 tiny fillets. They sported the same light breading as the bluegill, and were perfectly fried to the point where the breading was practically translucent. Gabes crap-load of cod was next in the queue as he let me have one of his four large chunks. The fish was very flaky, stark white, and featured a light breading which and was fine, but didnt have a lot of flavor. It was mirrored by Bethanys haddock which was also good, but could have used a little pick-me-up. The atypical cuts of haddock were denser and much firmer than their saltwater counterparts, but tasted quite similar. While all the fish were good, my bluegill stole the show with the perch, smelt, cod and haddock falling in line behind.You might think with such huge portions of fish flying around that the sides would suffer, but youd be wrong. Like the fish, there are a ton of choices for sides including: fries, potato salad, wedges, cottage fries and hash browns (the cottage fries were sold out, by the way). I decided on the hash browns with cheese and onion as did Jer, with Gabe picking the PS and Bethany the wedges. The hash browns took up half of the plate had to stand a good 3 high. These spuds were the cheesiest ever and crowned lovingly with huge fried onion loops. They were greasy and delicious and while Jer thought better of it, I took the whole thing down. Gabes potato salad was also delicious and also came in a huge pile, while the wedges were so-so, but also the thickest we have ever seen. With so much fish floating around youd think Nelsons would drown you in tartar, but strangely, the amount of sauce served was highly disproportionate. It turned out this wasnt the worst thing since the homemade concoction was good, but not great. It was composed of a fairly thick mayo base, but was a little heavy on the relish. Luckily, the small cup that came with the entrée was well supplemented by the two that arrived with the smelt and made overindulging all the easier.The bread was not much to speak of as the plain-old roll was certainly not made in house or anything like that. The slaw also suffered as the small cup of finely chopped, semi-creamy cabbage didnt have much taste, and lacked any sort of zip.Since Nelsons is a rural bar you really cant expect it to be a five star establishment. Its dark, its dingy, the bathrooms might get cleaned once a month (if youre lucky), but these are just the kind of places you can expect to find a great Fish Fry. When all was said and done, only one of us (me) had a clear plate while the rest of the leftovers went into a box for Jer. Like we said, it is almost impossible to leave Nelsons Crossing without a box, and apparently even MFF is not immune. Overall, we take the grime with a grain a salt and still highly recommend the Fish Fry. We are already making plans to delve deeper into Deansville for a little more felt and smelt.The final rankings from a fabulous Fish Fry at the Crossing - 1  Bluegill 2  Perch 3  Smelt4  Cod5  Haddock1152 Berlin RoadMarshall, WI 53559     (608) 655-3059",6512,0.1449933862433862,0.5230947293447293

Gabes potato salad was also delicious and also came in a huge pile, while the wedges were so-so, but also the thickest we have ever seen. With so much fish floating around youd think Nelsons would drown you in tartar, but strangely, the amount of sauce served was highly disproportionate. It turned out this wasnt the worst thing since the homemade concoction was good, but not great. It was composed of a fairly thick mayo base, but was a little heavy on the relish. Luckily, the small cup that came with the entrée was well supplemented by the two that arrived with the smelt and made overindulging all the easier.The bread was not much to speak of as the plain-old roll was certainly not made in house or anything like that. The slaw also suffered as the small cup of finely chopped, semi-creamy cabbage didnt have much taste, and lacked any sort of zip.Since Nelsons is a rural bar you really cant expect it to be a five star establishment. Its dark, its dingy, the bathrooms might get cleaned once a month (if youre lucky), but these are just the kind of places you can expect to find a great Fish Fry. When all was said and done, only one of us (me) had a clear plate while the rest of the leftovers went into a box for Jer. Like we said, it is almost impossible to leave Nelsons Crossing without a box, and apparently even MFF is not immune. Overall, we take the grime with a grain a salt and still highly recommend the Fish Fry. We are already making plans to delve deeper into Deansville for a little more felt and smelt.The final rankings from a fabulous Fish Fry at the Crossing - 1  Bluegill 2  Perch 3  Smelt4  Cod5  Haddock1152 Berlin RoadMarshall, WI 53559     (608) 655-3059",6512,0.1449933862433862,0.5230947293447293

Strangely enough, our love for the alluring ale started right around the same time as our fancy for the fried delights, forever linking the two in our mind. Perhaps surprisingly, or perhaps not, the home of the benevolent brew is also the home to a trio of top notch Fish Frys, not the least of which was our latest Friday excursion.Like bees to nectar we bobbed and weaved our way through the narrow New Glarus streets, drawn, as if almost by instinct, to the edge of town where the saccharine delights of Flannerys Wilhelm Tell reside. We buzzed through the front door at 7:30, postulating that a list and some bar-time were in our future. Quite to the contrary, we were barely even able to snag the bartenders eye, grab a Holstein and pay our tab before our table was available. We were seated straight away, and just as quickly made the acquaintance of our waitress. Even with only mere moments to peruse the menu, we made our choices and hit her with without delay. Bam!With my order of AYCE haddock came an option for salad or coleslaw of which I chose the cabbage derivative. It arrived before the fish and was nothing less than excellent. It was creamy with an almost deviled egg-like quality (perhaps mustard and Miracle Whip played a part?) It partnered well with the football shaped rolls which were above average, but would have been much better if served warm. Five minutes or so after polishing off the slaw the fish arrived, freshly fried and hot. The first go-round only had four small pieces which I lovingly dubbed the FishNuggets. Unlike their MickyDs counterpart this 4-piece was clearly high quality as evidenced by its extreme flakiness. It was smooth and creamy, finishing with an almost buttery essence. It was enhanced by Flannerys light, golden-brown breading which was delicious but could have used a hint more salt. The second round was more of the same, although since they give you the option to mix-n-match I manned-down a tried a couple pieces of the baked as well. Like the fried rendition, the baked was also delicious, as it was very moist, generously seasoned with paprika and almost melted in your mouth. Pairing with the fried haddock was Flannerys homemade tartar which was tasty but had an almost Kraft-like twinge. By and large it was fine and while hardly any relish was evident in the thick mix, the pungent aroma led me to believe some pickle juice played a part. Potato pancakes are pretty hard to come by around these parts, but Flanneys apparently has the inside scoop, and features them with the Friday fish. The three medium-sized medallions were semi-thick, and sported a crispy, near-perfect crust. Their subtle onion flavor blended wonderfully with their apple sauce accompaniment making for a truly sublime side. All in all the food was great, but we would be remiss if we didnt mention the stellar service. While our waitress was younger than average it was evident she genuinely cared about her customers wellbeing.  She was very nice, extremely polite, punctual, and actually seemed to enjoy her job, which is very refreshing in this day and age. While I did need to take the initiative and inquire about the AYCE portion of the Fish Fry it was a very minor inconvenience and the service she did provide more than made up for that small oversight on her part. At MFF we fancy ourselves as good tippers, and quite honestly, she may have gotten the best one ever, deserving every penny.New Glarus has a niche. Sure the brewery is great, and we will forever fawn over their Spotted Cow, but their place in Fish Fry lore is quickly being cemented along with their legendary suds. Weve sat at The Stube, weve hit The Hotel, and now weve come full circle at Flannerys. I guess you could say that you just cant go wrong with a Fish Fry in New Glarus. Overall, we highly recommend the AYCE Fish Fry at Flannerys and properly perch them amongst the best of the best  New Glarus or not.www.flannerysnewglarus.com/index.html114 2nd StreetNew Glarus, WI 53574     (608) 527-2618",4199,0.24391582491582497,0.513594195927529

My bluegill was very good and the 10 tiny fillets pretty much filled the plate. The menu didnt clarify whether they were breaded or battered, but they appeared to be battered to me. The alleged batter was nice and thin and had a very good flavor. While they tasted great they were generally a mixed bag, with some being tiny and others quite meaty. Regardless of their stature the fish were flaky, well-fried, and worked flawlessly with the light batter. While the sunfish I supped was nothing to scoff at the cod stole the show. The saltwater surprise was incredibly flaky, and fell apart effortlessly  no chewy, greasiness here. It hosted a superb batter which was unbelievably thin for a beer batter and just amazing. The tasty coating paired perfectly with the smooth and flaky cod making for a inspiring experience. In fact, it was so good that even Paul ate every last morsel which threw me for a loop since he usually hedges his bets on the fried foods and I was hoping to scarf up his leftovers.

They were served in a unique rectangular shape, with a run-of-the-mill slice of American cheese and 1 square onion chunks scattered evenly throughout. The shredded spuds complemented the bluegill so well that they challenged it bite for bite, both being finished off at the same time in one massive mouthful of fried nirvana.Pairing profoundly with the cod and the bluegill was Pickle Trees homemade tartar. The thick topping was simply superb as a subtle amount of relish allowed the magnificent mayo to shine. The pleated paper cupful even passed the inversion test as I flipped it, Blizzard-style, gave it a squeeze, and watched the sublime sauce defy gravity. Awesome. Finishing off the Fish Fry was some finely chopped coleslaw which was chockfull of carrots and radish. The creamy concoction was clearly homemade, but a little heavy on the radish which gave it a strange twinge. The base-sauce also lacked any zest which really allowed the radish flavor to overpower the mix.Apparently the Pickle Tree lays claim to the title of Best Fish Fry in Deerfield and even though I have never had another Fish Fry in Deerfield I know it to be true. I mean, it would be very unlikely for another place in a town that size to offer a Fish Fry this good. It is simply top-notch, complete with all the trimmings, and at a good price.

http://madisonfishfry.com/reviews.php?restaurant=296,http://madisonfishfry.com/reviews.php?restaurant=296&event=623,2011-08-13,Greenwood Supper Club,"Overall, I would highly recommend this Fish Fry.",Excellent,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Good,"Some people take the initiative to have a Fish Fry every Friday. Still others go above and beyond by harvesting a duo of fried delights each week. Then there are those who go crazy. For these fish obsessed types even Friday specials are not enough to quench the thirst. While it is a far cry from the ordinary, they will take any and every opportunity to sup the saccharine delights of fried fish often passing on Prime Rib, scoffing at scallops, and eschewing escargot in favor of something more, something bigger, something better. They seek the truth, the meaning of the fish, the life it gives. MFF is their kindred spirit. We arrived in Door County with a couple priorities: 1  have a relaxing anniversary weekend (that was the wifes priority), and 2  hit up the Greenwood Supper Club for their World famous lake perch (you can guess whos priority that was). We wheeled into the County road A&F intersection establishment at 6pm on a Saturday envisioning a sizeable wait was in store. What we found was an empty bar, and a mere five minutes to enjoy its coziness before we were shown to our table.As some as we were seated our friendly waiter came right over and grabbed our orders, the perch for me and the lone veggie-friendly dish on the menu for the better-half. It should be noted that the Greenwood isnt exactly for the penny-pinchers among us ($17 for small perch portion and $22 for large), but the food is good, and worth the steep prices.Before the fish we got a big old basket of bread encompassing three different styles  one honey-nut loaf, and two crusty buns. By and large all were very good, with the honey-nut boasting the most flavor and desirability. In addition, we were treated to a soup/salad option which went above and beyond the simple slaw were accustomed to. The salads were a fairly average mix, but were highlighted by the Greenwoods phenomenal homemade dressings. The wife liked the cherry vinaigrette, but even she said it paled in comparison to the Ranch I chose.  Hand to god this Ranch was better than Hidden Valley, which is the standard by which all Ranch should be judged. It was simply enthralling with a fantastic zest and perfectly creamy texture. Best . Ranch. Ever. The main course came 10  15 later and was as hot as can be. The plate was straight-forward, housing five butterflies of lake perch radiating out from a single cup of tartar sauce much like troops flanking an enemy stronghold. The fillets were a good size, but not quite Villa-large. They were perfectly fried with a slight sheen of grease that helped them slide down easy. A light breading schmoozed with the sweet perch making for an idyllic flavor combination. The fish, likely from local waters, was flaky and I even caught a tiny bone or two, but my chompers sawed through them like a hot knife through butter. By and large it was superb, as well it should be for seventeen bucks.With the fish came a homemade tartar which was thick and creamy, but a little too sweet for me. I assume the culprit was the use of sweet relish instead of dill relish, but I cant quite be sure on that. What I can be sure of is that the sauce was whipped to an almost miracle whip smoothness which made for a uniquely silky texture. There were no chunks that I could see, which was a little strange, but not a deal-breaker by any means.Unlike most Supper Clubs the Greenwood doesnt feature the hash brown option, which I have to say is a bit of a bummer. In lieu of the pan-fried classic I opted for the wedge fries which our waiter recommended over the regular fries. He was right. The wedges were wonderful. They were well-seasoned, and fried to the point where the exteriors almost bubbled off yet left the interiors supple. It was a balancing act of deliciousness and the Greenwood stuck the landing.Worlds Best Lake Perch is a whopper of a claim, and while Im not sure the Greenwood fully backed it up, they werent that far off. The fish was great; no doubt about it, but there is still some perch out there that we prefer. Luckily, the classic Supper Club knows that Fish Fry is about more than just the fish and represents the potato, tartar, bread and salad well, making for a great experience when all is said and done. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and will probably make a habit of visiting them each and every time we are in The Door. If you want great food in a classic atmosphere topped off with professional service in DoCo, its all at the Greenwood.www.greenwoodsupperclub.netN9087 County Road AFish Creek, WI 54212     (920) 839-2451",4579,0.23669406651549516,0.515633249026106

Simple can also be boring. The Cottage Café can be a bit of both. They make good looking grub that is no doubt timeless, but can also be a little dull. Regardless, their food is a great value, especially the $6 Friday Fish Fry.For six bucks every order of fish comes with two pieces of cod, your choice of potatoes, a cup of tartar sauce, a side of mixed veggies, a dinner roll, and a cup of soup. The soup of the day was beef vegetable and it showed up in advance of the fish. It was a nice addition that normally doesnt come with a Fish Fry, but since Im no soup critic Ill just say it was good and leave it at that. The fish plate came about five minutes after the soup and looked pleasant with a side of peas and corn standing in for the standard coleslaw. I popped the lid on the cup of tartar and went to work on the fish right away. The pieces of cod were thin but not flaky, and home to a light breading that was fine, but not flavorful. In addition, the two small chunks were slightly over-fried which resulted in the mid-quality fish being a little chewy. The below average cod could have used a pick-me-up, but there wasnt a whole lot of support for it anywhere on the plate. Normally, said support would come in the form of a zesty tartar sauce, but the Cafés version was merely mayonnaise. There wasnt a hint of relish anywhere to be found, and while Im a man who loves his mayo, this was a bit too basic, even for me. Potatoes, cheese, and onion are three of the most basic ingredients out there. How is it that these rudimentary foodstuffs can come together to make something so striking, so alluring, so delicious? The hash browns with cheese and onion produced at the Cottage were simply striking, and anything but dull.Normally Id welcome a side of corn and peas, but when it comes at the expense of the coleslaw Im not so sure its a worthwhile trade. The steamed veggies were exactly what youd think theyd be, but I cant help but think some slaw would have taken this Fish Fry somewhere steamed veggies cant.The roll was tardy, but eventually showed up with some room temp butter. Even though it was late it was soft and fresh, and still got devoured. Simple can be beautiful, but when things get too basic simplicity tends to get boring (especially when Fish Fry is involved). While everything looked fine, a few thing didnt deliver on their promises with the hash browns being the only truly remarkable item. Overall, I still recommend this Fish Fry, and while it's not top shelf, it is a good value.

Its only $7.50 for a full walleye Fish Fry, and there are a ton of other budget-friendly options too.The service at The Cottage Café is quick. Even if the waitress is old enough to be your grandma, shell bring your lunch in about 10 minutes.The Cottage Café uses good old fashioned ingredients to make their food. The lone piece of walleye in the Fish Fry will be hand-breaded. The fish will be flaky and moist and devoid of grease. The hash browns are the classic diner-style and will be crisp around the edges with a slice of American cheese and a pant-load of fried onions (available upon request) on top. The tartar will also be made in house. It will be thick and creamy and appear flawless, but will secretly house a dilly essence that is enough to overpower the mild fish.The food at The Cottage Café will be inoffensive. The breading on the fish will be light, but wont have much flavor to it. Likewise, the side of steamed veggies (which is a welcome addition) will be a little bland.(Other than the steamed veggies) The sides at The Cottage Café are above average. The small walleye fillet, while a fair portion for the price, is kind of skimpy. The two warm dinner rolls that come beforehand will help fill the void. CCs zesty coleslaw will also play its part, although some less-than-fresh cabbage has been known to limit the overall appeal of the dish.

My roll was warm and delicious as was the cornbread from all reports. There was also the option to try the soup of the day instead of the coleslaw and from what Julia had to say, the Brat-n-Cabbage was simply divine.The scuttlebutt on the web is that the service at the CC has a tendency to be hit and miss, but we experienced nothing of the sort. We had our fish in 5 minutes flat, and it was nice and hot - like it should be. The cod was clearly hand breaded and while the fish was flaky, it was a little dry. The breading on the two long thin cod slices was subtly spiced and little crunchy. While the flavor was fine, a little more spice would certainly have been welcome. It appeared the walleye had the same exterior element, but the crispy coating seemed to work a little better with the thicker, moister, freshwater fish fillet. The cod actually paired better with the thick tartar sauce than did the walleye as the relish-mayo blend overcame the lack of moisture present in the cod, but didnt enhance the flavors in the walleye. While the (homemade?) sauce was about average it did have strange twinge that I couldnt quite put my finger on making it slightly less than ideal.As you might expect from a place that emphasizes breakfast and luncheons the hash browns with cheese and onion were excellent.

As we wheeled around the building we came upon two doors, one of which led to Fish Fry, the other of which led to the bar. At this point we had no idea which was which, so we just chose one and, of course, found ourselves in the in the crowded bar.  It took a second to get our bearings, but we soon spotted an opening on the far side of the room which seemed to light the way. We were in the dining room in no time. We grabbed one of the open tables and within minutes our waitress came on by. She opened up right away and admitted that it was her first night on the job, which made me uneasy at first, but it would turn out that she had no problem asking questions and our fears would be quickly put to rest. Mama VF feeds her flock right and puts out a variety of fish including: walleye, cod, and ocean perch. The walleye will run you $9.50 while the cod and perch go for $10 which seems a bit bassackwards, but Im sure not one to complain about cheap walleye. Included with the Fish Fry is a trip to the salad bar on skates (wheels, actually). This veggie haven was propped up in the middle of a large dance floor just off the dining area, and while that alone was pretty cool, what lay beyond it was even more amazing. Playing for our, and everyones, amusement at the VFW this night, was a full band of what I would presume were local older fellas. Numerous elderly couples flanked their perimeter waiting for the leaf-holding impediment to clear out and open the floor for some serious two-steppin. Luckily, we got in before the bar was relocated and enjoyed the crisp Iceberg lettuce, crunchy croutons, ranch-y ranch, and run of the mill onions that it provided. While it wasnt exactly a bountiful spread (no cottage cheese, bacon bits, etc.) the macaroni salad, creamy, zesty coleslaw and salad mix more than sufficed. Some pre-sliced rolls were also available on the bar, but while the slider-looking buns were soft, they were very average.Our fish came no more than 5 minutes after wed exhausted our salads and was hot, but not scalding. As I suspected my cheap walleye fillet was a bit small, but not skimpy by any means. There was still a fair amount of flaky, moist meat which easily justified the $9.50 price tag. In addition, the fish was home to a light and flaky breading which was simply delicious. It had some serious spice, but even so, it didnt detract from the flavor of the fish at all.I also ganked some of the cod which was slightly greasier than the walleye, but still very good. It had the same breading as its freshwater counterpart and the hint of spice worked equally well with the ocean dweller. By and large it was flaky and moist and had Gabe wondering why every place cant make cod just like it. It didnt seem like it should be much of a challenge in his eyes. If this VFW can do it, why cant everywhere? Fair enough.Unfortunately for us, by quarter after seven the hash browns were long gone relegating us to French fry duty.

The idyllic blend was incredibly thick, composed mostly of mayo with just a twinge of relish to keep things interesting. It had the classic zesty finish, and not only improved the fish, but made the soggy fries palatable. As we finished of our food Gabe and Beth took to the dance floor and joined the hootenanny that broke out while we were enjoying our fish.

I never made it to BP, but I assume much of the original decor remains, and while it seemed sterile it also appeared to be pretty nice. We arrived on a sunny September Friday and rather than sit inside the banal edifice we decided to take a spot on the porch and surround ourselves with the wonders of nature (and the parking lot).Our waitress found our table a minute or two after we sat down and immediately sped off to get us a round of ice water. When she came back with the agua, she took our fish orders and again sped off, leaving us to enjoy the late summer air. The guys from work and I talked about our upcoming office move and about 15 minutes later our food arrived.The All You Can Eat cod at Wild Bull costs $11 and was actually better than I expected. The first plate had three small pieces which were surprisingly flaky and clearly hand battered. There was some grease present which was likely due to it sitting for a bit since it wasnt scalding when it arrived. The fish was punctuated with a flaky batter that apparently had some Blue Moon in it. The skunky suds added an odd twinge to the batter and even though some other spices were present in it, the golden brown glaze didnt do it for me. The second round was more of the same, and while I had no problem polishing off the two additional pieces, it was more a function of my hunger than their delectability. All You Can Eat often means fish only, but The Bull takes Fish Fry by the horns and includes fries in their offering. While they were just the standard crinkle-cut numbers, they were absolutely adequate and I appreciated the ability to cleanse my palate with them, especially on round two when they are normally long gone.Like the fish, the tarter had an odd twinge that detracted from its overall appeal. While it was thick and creamy, it had some red pepper in addition to the relish, and presumably something else that added to its off-taste.Rounding out the meal was a huge pile of house-made slaw which was not slightly off. Rather than fine, bite-sized chunks, it was composed of long shreds which were tough to get on the fork, and maintained quite a bit of raw cabbage flavor. The semi-creamy goo was below average and probably half of the enormous pile remained when all was said and done.Helping to knock this Fish Fry out of contention was the fact that The Bull doesnt pony-up with any sort of bread. If a slice of white or a dinner roll would have accompanied the meal they may have pushed their way into barely recommendable territory, but without it they were a few sticks shy of a load.p>You know, when all is said and done, this Fish Fry wasnt actually all that bad. There were some positives: its AYCE, its reasonably priced, and the service was good. But then again, there were some negatives too: no bread, the Blue Moon beer batter, and the bland décor of franchise-y kinda place. Overall, we cant recommend this Fish Fry, but while I personally wouldnt make another special trip for it, if you happened to find yourself at The Wild Bull on a Friday you could likely do worse.wildbullsportsbarandgrill.com/site/8420 Market StreetMiddleton, WI 53562     (608) 203-8420",3302,0.03490582130288013,0.4005665086547441

Some places can get away with 30 minutes and some places can push it slightly longer, but most folks max out at about an hour, and if they're quoted any longer they'll either go elsewhere or just go home. That's just how it is...unless of course you're at Green Acres...apparently people (including us) will wait forever for this AYCE.GA recently came under new ownership and these folks know a thing or two about Fish Fry. Their other establishments (Fish Tales, and the Spring Creek Restaurant in Lodi) really represent the best Friday night has to offer and adding Green Acres to their portfolio makes for a foreboding trio. Rumor also had it they weren't going to change anything about GA's AYCE haddock so we decided to see if that as the case and as far as we could tell it was. The Friday Fish at Green Acres is pretty much exactly what the people of southwestern Wisconsin want. For $14 diners are treated to all the fried haddock they can stomach complete with all the standard sides. There is also an endless salad bar available for $3.50, but at an AYCE I'll pass that up every time in favor of more fish. While we waited a loooooong time to get seated once we were the remaining dominoes fell quickly. The fish flew our way in no time and had a crispy beer batter and flaky white meat. The batter practically bubbled off the surface of the stark white loins, but clung ever so tenuously like an astronaut tethered in zero gravity. It was a majestic site to behold and every bit as beautiful as the sun cresting terrestrial surface of the Earth from lunar orbit. Whereas the fish was heavenly the fries were about as pedestrian as they come. Their lone saving grace was that like the humans before them, they overpopulated the planet they professed to love (which is a good thing when you're talking about fries). A big and bold tartar sauce cradled the haddock with care, but also set it off with all the panache you'd expect of a secret sauce. If one does not opt for the salad bar a side of pungent slaw comes with the fish, and a word to the wise - if you want the slaw you need to go this route as our recognizance reported there was none on said salad bar. Capping things off was one of the little loaves of slice-it-yourself bread that brought everything full circle. These are the loaves of my youth and for my money as finer bread option will never exist. While it has been nearly a decade since we last enjoyed a Fish Fry at Green Acres it seems as though nothing has changed - save for the owners. From the picture perfect All You Can Eat haddock to the mini loaves that we love so, this is what Fish Fry is all about.

It's easily the area's best (and really) only one of its kind, so if you miss a year it can feel like forever before you get another shot. This year I scrambled out on a Saturday night when the rest of the family wasn't interested in joining and was happy as a clam with what I found...at 6:30 there was an open table! So there was no line, no wait, and plenty of smelt to go around. It was like being in an alternate universe...I tried to pull the same stunt WITH the family a few weeks later and got shut out at 7:00. Go figure... The smelt at the gun club is done right - heads are chopped off, gut are cut out, and the rest is fried to perfection with a light and crispy breading that actually lets the fish show through. For $16 you get two trips through the buffet line which amounts to two massive piles of smelt if that's what you're after. There is also fried chicken and a bunch of sides so there is SOME variety. Since it wasn't jam packed the turnover was lower and the smelt I got had been sitting in the roasters for a bit. It wasn't as hot and crispy as I'd like but still featured their lovely breading and alluring fishy flavor. Between two trips through the line I easily put away 40 of the diminutive divers and felt like anymore would have put me over the edge...so I'll consider that All I Could Eat. As far as sides go the NBSC has them on lock-down. It all starts with their famous cheesy hash browns that live in the Nesco roaster adjacent to the smelt. This creamy and starchy blend is the shizzit and as close to the High School Athletic Banquet as you are going to get without setting foot inside a school. Following those spuds are even more potato products as pancakes make up the second option. These cakes were a little on the droopy side and didn't have much flavor of their own which made slathering them with the suppled with apple sauce or syrup a must (and something we would have done anyway). Historically the tartar at the club has hit the mark but this big squeeze wasn't sighted in correctly. It was warm (obviously), but you could tell it had been sitting a while without use - the oil was starting to separate and despite a good shaking by yours truly it never fully came back together. It was skunky, off-color, and off-putting. Luckily, this smelt can stand on its own two fins. Rounding out the buffet (at least for me) were some nice little slabs of bread and a creamy coleslaw. There is also coffee and milk for those who want it, but or me it's smelt and beers all the way. As far as the boasted chicken goes, I plucked a small drumstick and loved the crunchiness and the moist meat. Broasted chicken is always the bomb...you really can't screw it up too bad. This whole visit to the Club was kind of an anomaly and I wouldn't expect it to ever happen this way again. Usually, if you show up at 5:00 (when they start serving) you'll wait for at least an hour. The turnover will be so high the smelt will always be hot and freshly fried, and the potatoes will always be steaming hot. Our experience differed somewhat, but that's the price you pay for not having to wait...it's a trade-off and one I was fine with. Everything was still very tasty and the $16 felt justified. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and think it's one you simply have to experience for yourself.

If you're from Wisconsin, you know it's pronounced shmelt, not smelt. Once upon a time, smelt fries were found almost everywhere this time of year, from the VFW to the Eagles to the supper clubs, and they brought people out en masse. Those who've never ventured into smelt-filled waters should know that the fish are small and have a stronger-than-average fishy flavor (not unlike a sardine). They're usually served with the head, tail and guts removed, but since they are so small, and their bones so fine, they're usually not filleted. The firm-textured meat holds together well, allowing them to be eaten like a french fry, even after they've exited the deep fryer.In recent years the popularity of smelt has waned. That could be in part because the catches have been smaller since the mid-1980s, according to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. Luckily there are still a few great ones out there, if you know where to look. The area's smelt fry of record is currently at the North Bristol Sportsman's Club, northeast of Sun Prairie. It recalls the heyday of smelt. First and foremost, it's all you can eat (or at least, all you can fit on your plate on two trips through the buffet line). The smelt are lightly breaded and delicious, and there are a ton of amazing sides to choose from. The cheesy potatoes, scooped right out of a giant foil tray, are brilliant -- rich and gooey with a cornflake topping that evokes memories of high school athletic banquets. The potato pancakes are perfect, and the coleslaw is creamy. On the table sits a bottle of tartar sauce and one of shrimp sauce for those looking for a change of pace. Bread and coffee are also available, and some crispy fried chicken is on hand for those wary of smelt. However, there's only one smelt fry left at the North Bristol Sportsman's Club this season -- Saturday, April 12. Doors open at 4 p.m.; serving starts at 5 p.m. Get out there if you want to sample the best the area has to offer. While smelt season is winding down in North Bristol, it's just kicking off at the Owl's Nest in Poynette. Here, the smelt is all-you-can-eat but comes with limited coleslaw, baked beans, french fries and rye bread. The slaw, beans, bread and tartar will hit the table first. Be sure to establish a base for the smelt that is to come. And come it will. The Owl's Nest holds nothing back when it comes to smelt, and the plates come stacked high with golden fried goodness. As in Bristol, the smelt are lightly breaded in a well-seasoned mixture that takes some of the edge off the fish without stealing their thunder. It's not unusual to put away 20 to 30 of the tiny divers, especially when they're interspersed with some of the supper club's french fries. The smelt menu is served Sundays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays through April 17. Dexter's Pub has established itself as one of Madison's preeminent fish fry joints. It recently kicked off a Wednesday night smelt fry. While it's not all-you-can-eat (diners get around 12 fish), it's still a good deal. Dexter's puts in some serious prep work. Not only are the heads and tails chopped off and the guts cleaned out, but the kitchen goes the extra mile to fillet each and every one of them. From there, the fish are coated in Dexter's signature light breading and fried to golden-brown perfection. The filleting causes the smelt to lie totally flat, which for some reason also causes them to be totally delicious. Dexter's also does due diligence with the sides and offers a slice of rye to top things off. While most places serve smelt only for a certain period in the spring, there are still a few restaurants that offer it every day, year-round. The Beach House in McFarland is one. The smelt there are lightly dusted with a superb seasoned breading. These are some of the best smelt you'll find in the area, and they come with the standard sides. It's a great option for those who don't want to (or simply can't) wait for the spring smelt season. www.shootatnbsc.com7229 North Greenway RoadNorth Bristol, WI 53590     (608) 837-6048",4124,0.1765668934240363,0.5225941043083899

While the truly dedicated fish lovers among us appreciate the subtleties that the diminutive fish provide, many are turned off by the fishy taste, the tiny bones, and the eat the whole thing concept. These folks simply cant do it, and will never really know what they are missing out on. What theyre missing, of course, is a classic Wisconsin experience - the All You Can Eat Smelt Fry. Where theyre missing it is at The North Bristol Sportsmans Club and refuges like it. Out in Bristol, men are men, guns get shot, beer gets drank, fish gets eaten, and all is well in the world. While all are welcome, all wont be catered to, so dont expect a fancy martini in these parts... Now, wine in a box? That, they can do. Smelt Frys at the gun club are a seasonal affair (one Saturday per month From January through April) and if youre planning on catching one wed suggest showing up early. While the AYCE feast supposedly runs from 4-8pm you can bet dollars to donuts the hundreds of pounds of smelt provided will run out long before the little hand reaches the eight. We showed up around 5:00, and waited for almost an hour. Thankfully, the beers were flowing and the time flew by as we BSd with the clubs president and vice president, bought raffle tickets for guns, and sipped our cheap drinks in the warm country sun while we waited.When beckoned to eat we quickly paid at the register, received our disposable plates, and hopped in line. The spread began with a bang  a huge pan of cheesy potato casserole. The gooey goodness was immediately followed by members of the Smelt Team serving huge scoops of freshly fried smelt from one steam tray, and plump pieces of fried chicken from another. After loading up on this bounty there was hardly a square inch available for the slaw that followed, but I managed to squeeze a scoop or two in.Wasting no time, I tore into my initial allotment as soon as I returned to the table. I was blessed with at least 20 smelt on the first round and ate every one of them. Besides being gutted and having the heads removed the fish were intact. Their waifish bodies were fried to a perfect crispness and had just the right amount of fishy taste without being overbearing. A nicely spiced breading was light and enhanced the flavor of the smelt even more. They were bite-sized bits of heaven that were every bit as good on round 1 as they were on round 2, and for some of us, rounds 3 and 4. Simply superb. Overeaters rejoice! For those not in the smelting mood, the delicious, dare I say, supper club-esque fried chicken was also provided. The broasted birds were moist and meaty, with a copper colored crust that was as flaky as it was tasty. It was a nice bonus and a welcome respite after 20 or so smelt in a row.Several scoops were taken of the cheesy potato casserole on round one and since it was absolutely phenomenal, several more were acquired on subsequent visits. It was everything youd expect at a high school athletic banquet - tons of cheese, cornflakes on top, the whole 9 yards. It was awesome stuff and a smart move at an AYCE offering.The migration of smelt from fryer to belly comes complete with a tartar cavalcade. The splendid sauce came in a huge squeeze bottle and was delivered to our table nicely chilled. It was practically the perfect blend - thick and creamy, almost all mayo, with just a dash of this and that. It paired perfectly with the smelt. Rounding out the meal was some creamy coleslaw and some sort of bread (that I cant remember for the life of me). The slaw was zesty and delicious, although with so many tasty treats available only once scoop was taken. The bread on the other hand, while not memorable, was available and at least average (were pretty sure). What can you say about a Fish Fry like this one? It just has everything. The AYCE smelt and fixings were superb, the people were welcoming, and the event was well-coordinated. Everyone in our party agreed that it was a great time and well worth the drive into the country. Overall, we highly recommend the Smelt Fry at the NBSC and have already marked our calendars for next year. Inside Tip: Bring your appetite, but not your gunThe Smelt Fry is a very special occasion and since the club gets very busy all the shooting ranges are closed. Not to fear though. Wear your favorite hat, grab a cold Spotted Cow and youll be right at home. The Fry starts at 5:00 but make sure to get there early to ensure you get you fill of the tasty smelt. Even though they cook upwards of 300 pounds it does run out!*The North Bristol Sportsmans Club is in the country past Sun Prairie. There is no smelt like this anywhere in Madison. It is special.Previous:Ocean Perch at the  Esquire Club or  Introduction. www.shootatnbsc.com7229 North Greenway RoadNorth Bristol, WI 53590     (608) 837-6048",4886,0.2298371647509578,0.579544791096515

Sometimes youll find perfect perch in the seediest of bars, or scrumptious cod at the local lanes. From church basements to Mexican restaurants, when youre talking Fish Fry you never know exactly what to expect. Hell, around here even gun clubs have their barrels in the fish game. We decide to take a shot at one of em, and were blown away. Youll find The North Bristol Sportsmans Club about 30 minutes from downtown Madison out Highway 151 past Sun Prairie. When I arrived at 7:00 the Club was already plenty busy. There were probably only a couple open tables in the dining area, but since it was just me I grabbed an open spot at the bar. As soon as the bartender came over I asked for a beer and inquired about eating at the bar. It seemed to be a bit of an odd request and she wasnt sure exactly what to say as looked to what I assume was a member sitting at the bar for approval. He nodded and eventually she said okay, although was sure to point out that she was no waitress.My 3-piece order went in and as I sipped my beer she brought over the condiment carrier and some napkins (no silverware though). As I glanced around I noticed the board with the specials said that salad bar came included with the fish. The bartender never mentioned anything about it, but I assume it just slipped her mind  she was no waitress after all. As I was about to go get some of the green goodness the fish emerged from the kitchen and I had a decision to make. Since I wanted some salad, but didnt want to let my fish sit idle, I made chose to quickly try the fish then make a run to salad central. I dove in, trying piece one of three. Perhaps it was overzealousness, or perhaps naivety, but whatever it was I was greeted by some of the hottest fish mankind has ever known. I took a bite, and was forced to chase it instantly with a big swig of beer to keep it from burning the inside of my mouth. At this point I thought better of the situation, and decided it best to let the cod cool as I sauntered to the salad bar.For being a hunting club the veggie spread in North Bristol was impressive. The spread was much nicer than I expected, coming fully loaded with: potato salad, coleslaw, cottage cheese, baked beans, macaroni salad, mixed greens, all the salad toppings, two soups, and 3 types of bread. I took a small portion of most of the stuff on that list and picked the pumpernickel-rye as my bread. I headed back to the bar-bar hoping the time at the salad bar had given my fish a chance to cool down. On the way I snagged a fork from the girl manning the silverware station and got ready to feast. What happened next is a bit of a blur. I know I remember eating everything and that it wall was delicious, but I dont remember exactly what got eaten when. It was a bit of a whirlwind with what I presume were giant mouthfuls of things mixed together; pumpernickel meeting cod, and coleslaw canoodling with cottage cheese. It all happened so fast that in the end a mere single bite of cod remained, but Ill do my best to recount the tale.Upon my return, the cod had cooled enough to make eating it possible. The three pieces were simply huge and made me thankful I didnt opt for the $13.50 5-piece (which I seriously considered). The fish itself was flaky, and pure. It was a pristine canvass on which an outstanding breading was painted. This masterpiece was light and flaky, and clung to the fish miraculously well. Each bite housed a good amount of spice which was simply scrumptious and I thought rivaled the likes of Tobys. Recently we have been less than inspired by the standard Friday fries and have been branching out in to the hash browniverse. Unfortunately, the NBSC doesnt feature the standard shreds and our only fall back was the typical Julienne jobs. This woeful bunch was average at best and slightly under-fried. Luckily, they were perked up by some spunky tartar sauce that kept yours truly coming back for more. This zest master of a sauce arrived in the caddy in a gigantic squeeze bottle, and while it wasnt cold, it was really good. I used well more than my share of the creamy goodness as it took the cod over the top and improved the fries tenfold. ->The salad bar items and bread were eaten intermittently (I assume), but I vaguely recall them all being well above average. The pumpernickel was incredibly soft and highlighted by a subtle rye flavor. It paired well with the its salad buddies, transferring them plate to mouth, doing its best utensil impression all the while.The only failing to this Fish Fry (if there is a failing) is that every Friday throughout the month has a rolling theme. This week it was prime rib, and while MFF loves him some prime rib, on Friday it is more of a distraction than an attraction. We kind of wish they would just do what they do the 4th Friday of every month and offer lake perch and walleye instead, but that is us being very nitpicky. The service also wasnt great, but of course, we couldnt expect it to be. The waitresses in the dining room seemed to have it much more together.Our next trip to the NBSC will be on said 4th Friday, and we will be sure to sample the perch and/or the walleye. If indeed these freshwater dandies house the same breading as the cod, look out brother, it could be amazing stuff. Overall, we highly recommend the regular Fish Fry at the North Bristol Sportsmans Club and will be back soon to sample this other fare. Who knows? Maybe well even come back in the spring for their big Smelt Fry? If its anything like the weekly fish special, it worth a shot in the dark.www.shootatnbsc.com7229 North Greenway RoadNorth Bristol, WI 53590     (608) 837-6048",5719,0.17252893518518517,0.4478159976597476

A few weeks back we got bit in the ass attempting this feat so we were somewhat hesitant to try our luck again, but having heard nothing but good things about DJs Shortstop we decided to throw caution to the wind. This time around, our gamble paid off big time. Jackpot!Miah, Melsa and I arrived on the south shore of Lake Koshkonong around 6:30 and had no problem locating the small bar in the middle of a trailer court. The cramped parking lot practically overflowed into the lake, but we happened upon an open space and snatched it up. We walked in the back door, rounded a corner, found a gap at the jam-packed bar, and ordered a round of drinks. The dining area was abuzz but well orchestrated by a single ultra-diligent lady, who, even though we merely made eye-contact with her figured out our situation and put us on her mental waiting list. Within five minutes, her busboy had cleared a spot and she pointed us towards it. She was doing an amazing juggling act. It was impressive to say the least.It took her a little while to come over (which she adamantly apologized for even though it didnt bother us in the least) at which time she informed us the walleye was sold out and the bluegill was no more (at least for the time being). While the allegedly huge walleye fillets are what drew us in, their absence wasnt the end of the world and I simply shifted my focus to the bluegills surrogate  the $12.50 lake perch. Miah was feeling even more adventurous than I, and chose the catfish special, while Melsa played it cool with the classic cod. Of course, since the Lady Melsa was with us, we also got an appetizer of mini-corndogs which hit the table before the fish and were exactly what you would expect they would be  corny-wienie goodness.  Our aquatic trio was ready in no time flat and set before us (and a lone remaining corndog) in pristine condition. The two lake perch fillets were absolutely HUGE and measured somewhere close to a foot each. The length alone had us all wondering if these were some sort of super-fish, or if maybe, just maybe, DJs was passing off some other perch species as the famous Wisconsin lake perch? While the skin had the classic LP appearance the size alone made it dubious and I assume the fish might actually have been pike perch, which, while in the lake perch family, is not exactly the same thing. Regardless, it had the classic taste and texture you come to expect from perch, and the flaky, tender fish was still very edible.Like the perch the catfish came in two chunks, but contrary to purported perch the pieces were smaller than youd expect. The bottom feeder fillets were not flaky, but you wouldnt necessarily expect them to be. They were slightly-mushy, but featured a velvety texture with good flavor. While it, and perch were passed the test, the cod was terrific and basically stole the show. The ubiquitous breading that adorned all the options worked best with saltwater surprise as the smooth flaky fish gave it the perfect field on which to play. Both breading and meat were delicate and flaky which resulted in a great flavor combination. With the walleye out of the competition the cod easily claimed the top spot on the podium with the catfish and lake perch taking silver and bronze, respectively. Unlike the fish, the potato options werent great. The potato pancakes were basically two pre-formed hash brown patties served alongside a big cup of apple sauce. The factory-fresh spuds were fine, but just were not up to snuff. The waitress-recommended cheesy potato casserole was better, but still nothing to write home about, although it was ultra-cheesy. A large cup of tartar brought its A-game and paired perfectly with the cod and adequately with the other two fish. The thick and creamy mix had the proper proportion of mayo to relish and featured a little something extra some red pepper perhaps?  The crowning jewel in this fish crown was a pre-buttered half-slice of marble rye. It was soft, fresh, and simply excellent. The only drawback was the fact that we werent allotted the full slice which would have pushed it into near-perfect territory. The slaw was also great as the creamy blend featured copious amounts of mayo blended with subtle horseradish undertones. We were certainly disappointed that the walleye was sold out by 6:30, but that is the way it goes sometimes - the early bird gets the worm (or the fish in this case). However, the three additional options more than made up for the deficient fish, and when combined with all the sides make for three easily recommendable Fish Frys. Whats more, it was nice to see a waitress at a bar as diligent as DJs was. She simply dominated the room, doing all manner or task, from cleaning tables to serving food and bringing drinks. 10 tables of varying sizes? No problem-o for JDs waitress extraordinaire. Overall, we recommend the Fish Fry at DJs Shortstop and will be back again soon (probably around 5pm) in an attempt to get our hands on some of that walleye. www.djsshortstop.com11601 N.

Eddiess offers cod and perch on Fridays, although, as I would find out later, the kitchen is too small to batter any of them in house. Bummer.My 3-piece perch was so-so at best. The fish was actually somewhat flaky, but had the thick coating you come to expect from pre-breaded Sysco-style stuff. At least is still kind of tasted like perch, so it was palatable. Presumably, the $7 2-piece cod or $9 for 3-piece werent much better since they were also not made fresh in house.The bartender billed the fried as McDonald-style and as she did a couple diners down the bar were sure to point out there they were superior to the waffle fries in every way.  The thin cuts were definitely tasty, but not exactly what I would call McDonalds-addicting. The freezer-fresh spuds did come in a large quantity however, so much so that they completely obscured a pickle spear which turned out to be a welcome treat once the fries were thinned. Eddies tartar was also presumably Sysco as it had the look of pure mayo, but with a fairly strong relish flavor. It definitely improved the fish, but kind of like a fish stick with Hellmans, it might suffice, but how good can it really get? No bread came with the Fish fry so the only remaining item was the finely chopped slaw which was adequate, but not great. Id give it a solid B.Overall, there is just no recommending the Fish Fry at Eddies Ale House as it stands. The lack of anything being freshly prepared is just unacceptable, and this is clearly a case of them having fish just to say they do. Oh well, its not the end of the world, there are plenty more fish in the sea, as they say. And while we dont recommend the Fish Fry, the bar itself was awesome, boasting an impressive beer selection and what appeared to be some tasty burgers.

The Sauk-centric burger chain truly is a microcosm of what people in Wisconsin stand for: quality ingredients, fast/friendly service, and good value. One of the ways they achieve this level of quality and efficiency is their unique ordering system where you put in your order at the counter, take a number, and then get your food served to you once it is freshly prepared. This delivery model has sparked a loyal following as you are guaranteed a meal made just for you while you wait. While we at MFF enjoy a good Butter Burger every now and again, our focus is on fish, and we always wondered why this delivery mechanism hadnt been applied in the realm of Fish Fry. Apparently we were wrong, and it has.Cranberry Creek on Madisons south side has taken the Culvers methodology and run with it. They serve a full menu of food, including daily specials, all made to order and brought to your table in a timely fashion. Jer and I put in our orders for two of their 3-piece beer battered cod, got one ½-off with a coupon, and took a booth near the window.The food came exactly 10 minutes after we ordered, and was steaming hot when it arrived, save for the fries which must have exited the oil a little sooner than the fish.The cod was hand battered, but only tasted so-so. The batter was kind of bland and could have used some more salt and pepper. While the fish itself was flaky it got very greasy thanks to its semi-thick batter. By the time I reached the last piece the batter on it was sopping wet and sloughed off the fish as if to say Ive done all I can. On the side, in their own little designer fryer basket, came a handful of CCs Truffle Fries. The skin-on spuds appeared to be double-fried and were very good. Try as Jer might, he couldnt discern any truffle oil within the home-cut potatoes, but even so, still enjoyed them. While we wouldnt say they are ready to rival the fries at Graze or Jacs, they definitely arent all that far behind.A presumably homemade tartar sauce also made the trip and while it was almost pure mayo there were some relish-like items which added a little flair to it. The slaw was also pretty good, and also appeared to be made in-house. It was rich and creamy with a unique flavor that almost tasted fruity. Me thinks an ode to their boggy moniker may have played a part.Rounding out the meal was an individual roll which was soft and hearty, and served with a side of CCs delightful cranberry butter (which is supposedly famous, but I really doubt it). This wonder-bun was surprisingly excellent and pulled what would have otherwise been a very marginal Fish Fry closer to recommendable territory.At the end of the day, we learned a couple valuable lessons from Cranberry Creek: 1 - The Culvers delivery model can work for Fish Fry, 2  A bunch of great sides cant always overcome sub-par fish, and 3  Serving fries in decorative fryer baskets is unnecessary and a little cheesy. Overall, we just cant quite recommend this Fish Fry, although we would consider coming back to try something else maybe.www.cranberrycreek-cafe.com1501 Lake Point DriveMadison, WI 53713     (608) 222-4803",3175,0.22122782446311856,0.5750980392156863

Well, not really. More like a classic Wisconsin Fish Fry with a few subtle twists. The twists, you ask? Acceptable.Wed never been to the Bayou (at least I hadnt, Im not so sure about Gabe), but when we showed up it wasnt exactly what I was expecting. It really does look kind of like Bourbon Street (although Ive never been there either, so again, cant be sure), featuring a big balcony overlooking a street-like dining room floor. Strangely, there were only a few tables on the street level, with what appeared to be a handful more on the *CLOSED* balcony. Oddly, only one other table was occupied at 7pm on a Friday, so we essentially had our pick of the litter, and took one of the high-tops near the fruit machines. The lone bartender came over soon after and grabbed us a beer, of which they only have the New Orleans brewed Abita beer (needless to say, this is not the bar for the beer aficionado among us).Prior to the fish Gabe and I treated ourselves to an order of Bayou curds which were quite tasty and highlighted by a spicy Cajun-style batter. Id heard they were impressive (possibly the best in Madison, even), and while Id agree they were appetizing, Im not sure Id call them the best.The fish was ready about 15 minutes after our orders went in and was hot, but not scalding upon its arrival. The four pieces of cod featured a similar breading to the curds which was above average, a little spicy and not too thick. The extra hint of spice was nice since the fish appeared to not be the highest quality. Regardless, the overall taste combination was borderline excellent and not a crumb remained when we were through. The You also has Tilapia available on Friday, but Ill be damned if Im wasting my time on that - Ive had fried Tilapia before, and it felt like I was eating someones goldfish. Ill pass.While the individual pieces of cod were not huge, it added up to a fair amount of fish. Unfortunately, I cant say the same for the fries, as I could count their numbers just as easily. I kid you not, there were maybe 10 of the house-cut taters total. It was a miniscule portion, and whats more, they were under-fried and limp. It was too bad really since the few I did get were very enjoyable, and had they come in a larger quantity and been fried longer, could have flirted with excellence.Also letting us down was the Bayous take on tartar sauce. The presumably homemade blend tasted suspiciously Kraft-y, but boasted more dill that the commercial king. It overpowered the fish, which is really saying something since the fish had quite a presence on its own.You might expect a Cajun place to take a stab at a unique coleslaw (I mean, if there is any lee-way to experiment with Fish Fry it is the slaw, right?), but surprisingly the slaw on Butler didnt have any sort of zip. It was inoffensive, but I guess, I was just expecting something different. In addition, there was an odd salad-like thing on the side of the plate. What made it odd? Well, it was too big to be a garnish, but too small to be a salad, and there was no dressing to boot. Odd.As you might expect, the Bayous bread of choice was a slice off a French loaf which while tiny, was nicely toasted and tasted very good. Things tend to be a little wacky down in Cajun country and Id have to say the trend has made its way north. While this Fish Fry was a bit of a departure from the norm, the tweaks they made were acceptable. We always enjoy a little spice in our batter, and to this end, the Bayou obliges. While they didnt take opportunity to Cajun-up everything , what they did do was unique and tasty. Overall, we barely recommend this Fish Fry and will probably come back if were downtown and dont feel like waiting for a table forever at somewhere like The Coopers Tavern or The Old Fashioned. www.thebayoumadison.com117 S.

Enter John AxfordAfter Axford blew the save I was disgusted, to say the least, and couldnt bear to even watch the rest of the game. We got in the car and headed east, hoping a Fish Fry would wash the taste out of our mouths. We tuned in The Uek as we careened down East Wash, and he talked us down from our ledge as Axford came back and sailed through the 10th. We arrived at My Buddies just after CarGo hit his one out double, and before we could even get waited on Nyjer Morgan stepped to the plate, slapped one back up the middle, and sent the massive sports bar into a frenzy. It was an amazing way for The Crew to end it and a glorious way for us to see it all go down (My Buddies has their share of TVs, you see). No sooner had Gomez crossed home than our skater waiter came over and crouched down next to our table (he was a croucher, you see). He ran off to grab us some drinks, and once the pandemonium settled down, returned with them and took our food orders. My Buddies  offers four different fish on Friday (Cod, (Ocean) Perch, Tilapia, and Haddock), with an AYCE mix-n-match option. I wasnt feeling up for AYCE (although in retrospect for $2 more it should have been a no-brainer) so I just went for the fried cod with the potato recommended by our server. We were riding an emotional high after the big win so I dont really recall exactly how long it took for the food to arrive but it seemed like 10 minutes or so. I could tell immediately this was going to be an interesting Fish Fry. For starters, the portion was pretty conservative, especially for a sports bar. The fish was basically four small chunks with a dark brown breading. At first bite it was obvious; the fish was over-fried, which resulted in it being dry. While it wasnt burned, it was fried to a firm crispiness that was basically devoid of moisture. That said, it was still flaky (somehow) and somewhat like Wilsons, but with a much less flavorful breading.Our waiter recommended the seasoned steak fries over the regular fries and it turned out he was right on. Relative to the fish, there were more of wondrous wedges, and they tasted far better. They had a very distinctive flavor that almost reminded me of my grandmas Swedish Meatballs. Her hallowed recipe holds a special place in our familys heart as the meaty mastery was served at every family Christmas. Like the fries, they too had a distinctive flavor. The flavor you ask? Lipton onion soup mix Over-fried fish alone can be impossible to deal with. In these difficult situations a tough tartar is essential, and My Buddies brought the heat. The Buddy Sauce was thick and zesty, but came in a tiny cup that was scraped totally clean with only three of the four small pieces of fish. The cod begged for more, but the well was dry. I presume with the AYCE you could get another cup (or ten). Following suit came a reasonable portion of what appeared to be homemade coleslaw. This slaw was a real charmer with a great zest and very creamy consistency. It was simply delicious. A nice little roll rounded out the meal and according to the wife was cute. I just found it to be tasty, and slightly better than your average dinner roll.  If youre a fan of sports bars My Buddies is the place for you. If youre just a fan of Fish Frys it might not be the place for you, but you could do worse. If nothing else they have laid a solid foundation with first-rate fries, tantalizing tartar, creamy coleslaw, and resplendent rolls. They really do need to figure out how to not over-fry the fish, but once they have that mastered, the sky is the limit. Overall, in its current state this Fish Fry is not recommendable, but we have hope for My Buddies and will come back some time to see if theyve figured out the frying game.www.mybuddiesbar.com/index.html4325 Lien RoadMadison, WI 53704     (608) 819-8850",3926,0.048630952380952386,0.43752491502491514

As we passed The Argus we happened upon the all new Rigby Pub & Grill and something drew us inside. Immediately we were back in the U.S.S.R., entrenched in The Rigbys classic rock theme, centered on what may be the greatest group of them all, The Beatles. Since it was pretty busy we felt fortunate to get a couple stools at the bar, or so we thought. The bartenders minds were somewhere across the universe, and they seemed to look right through us. We wound up sitting there for a good five minutes with no reply from either of them. Eventually we just got up and left, and drove our car down to more hospitable surroundings. It made for a strange day in our lives and we left perturbed at the lack of help, but all was not lost since I knew wed be back for the $8 Fish Fry special (advertised on the board out front) soon enough.  p>My girl and I had a ticket to fry this Friday and arrived at The Rigby around 7pm. We headed upstairs since that is where I figured the main dining area was based on our previous visit (and their sign indicating such). While the main floor is mostly filled by the large bar, the upstairs is more wide open and has a pool table, a dart board and about 6-8 dining tables. It looked fairly neat and tidy, but since it was so far removed from the main bar it became a strange free-for-all, as groups of people started moving tables nearer the TV to watch the impending Brewers game, creating disarray in the absence of an omnipresent wait staff. It was kind of weird, but eventually the lone waitress made her way upstairs, assumed some control, found our table (placed where it was when we got there), and took our orders. As soon as she left, mob rule once again took hold, and the volume on the TV went up and up - the sound of cracked bats and Tim McCarver filling the room. The 2-piece cod came about 20 minutes after she put in our orders and seemed to be of good quality, but clearly sat for a bit before being delivered. Sitting is never good for fried food and I could almost hear my Fish Fry gently weeping. While the fish had a good flavor, the beer batter was soggy on the underside as it took the brunt of the grease during it delay. The actual fish was still somewhat flaky despite the saturation, but since the batter could not be handled I resigned myself to using the dreaded fork. While I worked it out, it was not a warm gun by any means. The fish let me down by not being scalding hot, but the hash browns with cheese and onion were so hot I had to get back. The portion was surprisingly large and the cheesy spuds were delicious so Ill likely return for them when Im 64, if not sooner. The hash browns were great and I have to admit that even though the fish wasnt perfect the meal was getting better. Unfortunately, our waitress forgot the tartar sauce which added to this hard days night. By the time she made it back upstairs with it, one of my two pieces was long, long, long gone so I only got the full fish/tartar experience with the remaining piece. I assume the sauce was homemade as it appeared to have a McCormick mayo base (very rare to see), and some dill. While it was decent and made the greasier parts of the cod edible, this the bird cant sing. As your mother should know a Fish Fry just isnt a Fish Fry without some sort of bread, and The Rigby doesnt pass it by. The stand-alone white roll was sliced in half and accompanied by a pat of room temperature butter. It was nice and soft, and fairly fresh, like a little side of warm honey pie.Last but not least, came the slaw, and I said: Its alright. The homemade brew came in a large cup, and was as creamy as a savoy truffle, but not really zesty. However, it carried that weight adequately, and did what it needed to do. While the food was good, and probably recommendable on its own, the service was a huge let down, and our waitress definitely could have used a little help from her friends. The Rigby is seriously lacking organization, and even though the kitchen seems to be doing a great job, the front of the house is not here, there, and everywhere. In fact, when it came time to pay, our waitress never came to get her money so we just took it down, and dropped it at the bar on our way out the door. In the end the speed of the service was a problem as the freshness of the fish suffered due to the slowness. It seems that all they need to do is hire more wait staff, one for the main floor and one for the upper floor, and things would go much more smoothly. Maybe Im wrong on that one, but Ive got a feeling that is the smoking gun.After Gabe and Is experience I really should have known better, but MFF is a bit of a glutton for punishment, and just cant let it be. The Rigby is a cool place and we really do dig it, but until the whole service thing gets squared away we likely wont be back. It is too bad though, since the Fish Fry has a lot of potential. Overall, we cant recommend this Fish Fry based on this visit as the service and general lack of organization ruined the meal and caused the fish to suffer. It is a bit of a magical mystery, but a hole that Eleanor should be able to fix. And if she cant Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da, life does go ontherigbypub.com119 E.

It wasnt really a lounge and it wasnt really a supper club; it wasnt really tavern and it wasnt a regular restaurant either. Although it had an old school feel it kind of lacked a true identity. It was strange, but evolution seems to have helped Dok find a niche  a modern take on the classic supper club. And I like it.In classic supper club fashion the Klassik Tavern has a Fish Fry on Friday featuring the most classic Fish Fry fish of all  lake perch! There is also cod available, but at $14 I couldnt pass on the freshwater favorite. Our friendly-as-can-be waiter had the fish on the table quickly and while the portion was conservative it looked otherworldly. Properly filleted lake perch will fold open like book and for this reason they are often labelled as butterflies. Three of the Lepidoptera lookalikes graced the Klassik plate which amounts to six full fillets. While these werent the hugest perch on the planet they were definitely the real deal. The mild, tender fish was home to a stupendous breading that had me standing at attention. It had plenty of salt, and plenty of other stuff that gave it plenty of pizzazz. While the perch was clearly high quality on its own the breading shown even more brightly and straight up stole the show. Doks Fry comes with hash browns by default and I loaded mine up with cheddar and onion. These spuds were splendid with the only drawback being the smallish portion. While it cant be argued that the portion fell on the small end of the spectrum I can easily debate that Id rather have a smaller amount of great food than a whole bunch of garbage, so to that end Ill gladly take the conservative allocation of perfectly fried  crispy on the edges and gooey in the center  shreds with real cheddar. Some ridiculously good tartar lives in a big squeeze bottle on the table, and while Im not sure exactly what was in it, the flavor was out of this world. The texture was a bit odd (it almost looked lumpy or like it was congealing) but the peppy, zingy, clingy (and pretty much any other adjective ending in y you can think of) sauce didnt lose anything to it. It really took the already excellent perch into some elite territory. Little football shaped bread loaves came in a napkin-lined basket beforehand and werent warm, but werent necessarily cold either. Some runny yet zesty slaw was clearly a house-recipe and had plenty of pep so you know the kitchen isnt shy about unique flavors. The Klassik tavern have really grown over the last few years and gives Verona another legitimate alternative to the 5th Quarter and the Draft House on Friday nights. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and will make our way back next time were in the mood for some pristine perch.

As you enter you find yourself in what appears to be a real 70s Supper Club. The bar area boasts big padded chairs, lots of mirrors, and the glitz that you associate with an up-scale Wisconsin tavern of that era. Supper Clubs like these have been home to the classic Wisconsin Fish Frys for ages, and I knew we were in for a treat from the moment we crossed the threshold.  This Friday night the bar was plenty busy which added even more to the hustle and bustle feel of a hip 70s club. Gabe, Paul, and I grabbed a pitcher of beer and secured some stools from a couple that had just gotten up to leave.  We waited a good 15 minutes or so, and before we could even exhaust our drinks we were shown to our table in the upstairs nook. A few moments later our waitress came by, dropped some menus and went to get us another round. Since we were all here for fish we wasted no time in ordering when she returned. Gabe and Paul went for the $11 cod, while I branched out and picked the $13 lake perch. Almond Encrusted Walleye, Cod Florentine, and a Shrimp Platter were also available, but those dont say Fish Fry to me .The fish arrived within 15 minutes or so of our orders going in and was nice and hot. Both the cod and the perch came as 4-pieces, although the perch fillets were actually quite a bit larger than their saltwater counterparts. These perch must have been farm raised as they were absolutely massive and extremely meaty. In fact, two of the fillets were so thick, that even though the outsides were well-fried, the middles were not thoroughly cooked which resulted in an almost shrimp-like flavor and texture. By and large they were still flaky and tasty, and enhanced by their light breading which featured enough spice to keep it interesting.The small cuts of cod were much better than the perch, however. The fishnuggets, as Gabe described them, had a similar, if not identical, breading to the perch although it paired better with the flaky cod. The ultra-moist fish sopped up the love from the salty coating, producing a transcendent combination for the palate. Winner  cod.I know Paul got the fries, which he said were good, but I cant for the life of me remember what Gabe got (perhaps the steamed veggies, or some such charade?). Regardless, my hash browns with cheese and onion were fantastic. They were expertly fried and punctuated by a lovely cheese and onion tang. The portion size was also perfect and went bite-4-bite with the fish to the very end.A large bottle of tangy tartar sat full on the table when we arrived, and was almost gone at our departure. While the homemade sauce was good, it was somewhat strange at the same time. Rather than just being mixed it appeared as though it was blended which resulted in it being extremely smooth, but unable to really cling to the fish. It still had a nice zest, but wasnt as thick as we like it to be.Some finely chopped coleslaw continued the perfectly portioned parade. Like the fish and hash browns, the mid-sized Solo cup of creamy, zesty slaw was the perfect size and ran low at just the right time. Putting the finishing touches on this Fish Fry was the bread that almost wasnt meant to be. Somehow our waitress forgot our basket of rolls when delivering the fish and had it not been for a quick shout-out by Gabe we may never have seen it. Thanks to Gabes quick thinking we were able to get our hands on some of the wholegrain wheat buns, which were acceptable plain, but improved tenfold by the Authentic Butter Flavored Topping, according to the man who called out for the bread. All three of us really enjoyed our food and were pleasantly surprised with the The Klassik. It really is a pretty cool place, and classier than you might expect it to be. In fact, it is so engrossing that you might even forget you are dining in the shadow of the water tower in the heart of Verona. Overall, we feel comfortable recommending the perch and highly recommending the cod, and will likely be back before too long.

If you're willing to take a drive that is...You see, Peg & Doc's is all the way out in Dane (yes there is actually a town called Dane in Dane County), so the distance might look daunting to some. Dane is only about 15 minutes from my house on the North Side, but if you live downtown it might seem like too far to drive for for a small town tavern Fish Fry. Believe me when I say it's not. The list of the Friday lunch specials at P&D's is brief, they basically only have fried cod or a southwest baked version, but both versions come in at a scant $7, which is almost unheard of for any made-to-order meal in 2019...more or less a full fledged Fish Fry! The  two pieces of fried cod aren't the largest you will find, but at $7 they don't have to be. The duo is draped in a very light with a delightfully crunchy breading. It's not really thick, but sports a KFC-like extra crispy texture. What's more, it actually has a good amount of seasoning which paints an elaborate flavor mural on the cod canvas. This is just good stuff, and if I'd had my wits about me I'd have tacked on a third piece for another couple beans. While the cod is exemplary, the hash browns with cheese and onion are quite literally some of the best that have ever graced these lips. They are exceptionally crisp on the edges, slick and smooth on the inside, and dusted with some sort of nondescript seasoning. They are expertly done and when pinged as to how such greatness as achieved the answer given by the cook was simply: ""patience."" Good enough for me. Big squeeze bottles of thick tartar are there for the taking which means portioning is a non-issue. I gleefully slathered the sauce on each and every bite of the well-seasoned fish which likely resulted in me eating just as much tartar as actual meat. I'm a fiend when it comes to sauces like this and I have no problem admitting it. Rounding things out was a 4 oz cup of creamy coleslaw that actually had a little life to it. Sure, it may have just been Sysco, but my taste buds tell me otherwise. There was no roll, and for $7 I didn't expect there to be. They're on the salad bar at dinner time so if you've gotta have the starch you might want to wait and swing in after 4pm. Proclamations are meant to be bold and when I claimed this was the “best deal in Fish Fry” I meant it. When a GOOD Fish Fry costs less than a Value Meal at Micky D's you know it's a true deal. Of course, they also have cheap 10 oz beers, and with a couple mugs and a tip I was out the door for $14...now that's what I call real value. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish fry and I all I can say is small town bars are where it’s at! www.facebook.com/pages/Peg-Docs-Sports-Bar-Grill/104962512879752?sk=wall106 Dane StreetDane, WI 53529     (608) 829-6475",2870,0.2166314183501684,0.4731233465608465

Just because Peg & Doc's bills itself as a ""Sports Bar & Grill"" doesn't mean they are trying to be Buffalo Wild Wings. You won't find wall to wall TVs blaring sports coverage 24/7, nor will you find a bunch of noisy frat boys slamming pitchers of light beer. Sure, if it's Sunday the Pack will be on the tube, but this Friday they were showing America's Funniest Home Videos during the lunch hour and muffled conversations about work and someone's asshole boss we're all you could make out around the crowded bar. The dining room, also had a few people in it enjoying there fish, but I never once heard a ""First Down!"" or a ""Yeah, Bro!"" permeate the threshold. Peg & Doc's is more of a classic small town bar to me, but let's not let semantics get in the way; the reason we drive to Dane is their Fish Fry.The lunch special at P&D's is as good of a deal as you will ever find. For a mere seven beans you get a full-fledged Fish Fry, with all the trimmings (except for bread). It's your choice whether you want it fried or baked (regular or southwest style), and while I've been tempted to point my compass south a few times I've always stuck to the fried version - I mean this is Madison Fish FRY after all... Madison Fish Bake would just sound weird. And of course, I always make mine a 3-piece for a buck or so up-charge. It's so worth it. This cod is simply irresistible (eat your heart out Robert Palmer) and eat I did. For $7 you might think they'd skimp on size, but these are nice big loins of cod, and what's more, they apparently don't compromise on quality either as the meat is pure white and flaky as all get-out. They coat each in a light breading that has a fantastic flavor and a light crumbly texture. It's simply superb stuff and executed to perfection each and every time we're there. There are a few sides to choose from, but when I belly up to the bar I like to watch the hash browns get fried on the flat-top right before my eyes. I load mine with onion and American cheese, the slice of which is applied after the flip and exposes the warm crispy skin allowing the cheese to ooze into the voids. It's poetry in motion to watch and ambrosia on taste bud when eaten. A big bottle of bold and tangy tartar accompanies the plate and had me coming back for more time and again. It's a thick mix and while each squirt was prolly a couple tablespoons each, I likely averaged a squirt per piece. It's just too good not to use. A tart and slightly soupy slaw kept things interesting, but as I say, there wasn't any bread to be found. While it's not the end of the world in this case (I think there are some rolls on the salad bar at dinner time), the lack of bread can be the straw that breaks the camels back. Luckily, this dromedary is dutiful despite the absent starch and kept humping right along. If Peg & Doc's turned into a BW3's style sports bar I wouldn't mind as long a they kept the Fish Fry just as it is, but I know that wouldn't be the case. If they went for the glitz and glamor they would certainly have to compromise on quality to cover on overhead and the fish would undoubtedly suffer. I like Peg & Doc's just the way it is; a small town bar with a big time Fish Fry.

Usually I'm met with the the ""oh really"" or the ""you've got to be kidding me"" face when I tell them how good it is. People can't seem to fathom that such a tiny little bar in a tiny little town can have such a big time Fish Fry. Well, non-believers, I'm here to tell you one more time that it's true. Peg & Doc's has a great Fish Fry and it all starts with the fish.One of the best part about P&D's being (all the way) out in Dane is that most city folk aren't willing to go that far for lunch. Luckily for us, it's just a about a 15 minute jaunt up County V so we avoid most of the riff raff. Plus, since it's so cheap, any money wasted on gas is more than made up for by the superb cod and cheap beer. The quality of any fried cod mostly falls on the batter (or breading in this case) and the this crispy coating takes the cake. There is plenty of seasoning in this stuff, and while it might get a little slick around the edges it stays far from saturated. The flavor is just dead on and while they could skimp with crappy cod, as near as I can tell they get nice fat loins. Sure, the lunch serving is only two pieces, but when you can pack on more for a buck a pop anything goes...it also works great if you have hungry kiddos along who might (or might not) be willing to eat a full piece any given Friday. The doctor serves up some Villa Tap style fries, which are about as basic as you will find in this day and age. Still, they are marginally better than crinkles, but believe me when I tell you to skip them. The star of the show here are the hash browns with cheese and onion and by god these stars do shine. They are basically perfect in every way, from the crispy (not burned) edges, to the supple interiors, to the meltalicious cheese and slightly sauteed onion. If I had one word of advice regarding these superb spuds it wouldn't be for house, no no, it would be for everyone else: DO THEM LIKE THIS! YOU WILL WIN! This crew also knows a thing or two about tartar and trot out a bold and creamy blend that serves as the perfect Ginger to the fish's Fred. It waltzes effortlessly with the cod, dipping and twirling its across the palate in a harmonious ballet that leaves you breathless and wanting more. It is so bold, and so glorious and then there is no bread...and I die a little inside. The last man standing is a surprisingly diverse creamy slaw that strikes a pleasant balance most places can only hope to aspire to. Part of what make this such a great Fish Fry (beyond the infinitely tasty fish) is the scant $7 price tag. I mean, a value meal at Micky D's costs that much and here in Dane you aren't getting some crap from a box that has sat under a heat lamp for god knows how long. You're getting a hand-prepped meal made just for you, in a real world tavern, from real world folks. What could be better than that? No seriously, that's not a rhetorical question, I really want to know 'cause for the life of me I can't think of anything. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and everything it stands for. If you want some great fish, get out to Dane.  www.facebook.com/pages/Peg-Docs-Sports-Bar-Grill/104962512879752?sk=wall106 Dane StreetDane, WI 53529     (608) 829-6475",3259,0.28478855721393037,0.5611898839137645

I think Peg & Docs is awesome. And thats a fact.Great fish - $7. Yeah, seven dollars for a delicious, full-fledged 2-piece Fish Fry. And guess what, you can add additional pieces for a couple bucks a pop if twos not enoughand you know what? Its not. This stuff is great. Get more! The fish is just phenomenal. It starts with buttery, flaky cod that gets paired with a crispy, fried-chickenesque breading. This crunchy coating has just the right amount of seasoning to offset the pristine fish. Great hash browns - Yeah, P&Ds had French fries, but youd be remiss to skip these shreds. Get them with cheese and onion and your taste buds will be whisked away on a euphoric journey to a slippery, supple state of grace. The slight sheen of grease will let you know where youve been upon your return. Its a flavor meld of the highest order and pairs oh so elegantly with the sumptuous cod. Great tartar - Tons of the thick and creamy goo comes with the fish and is as ideal as they come. Its pungent, it has the perfect mayo:relish ratio, and it comes in an infinite amount (for all intents and purposes). Yeah, no bread is a letdown, but if youre one to pay up for the salad bar you can find some there. Thankfully, the slaw is great - thick and creamy, and not Sysco as near as I can tell. If you want frills, and you want to be pampered, Peg & Docs probably isnt for you. If, on the other hand, you just want a good, old fashioned, fairly-priced Fish Fry, take the trip to Dane. You wont be disappointed. They welcome all comers - dads, toddlers, and everyone in between.

Peg & Docs out in Dane is the epitome of the small town tavern, featuring plenty of cheap beer and a Fish Fry that is among the best values in all of Dane County. The Friday lunch special and P&Ds includes a $7.00 2-piece cod as well as a Cajun (baked) option. Unlike most taverns Peg & Docs has a legitimate dining room and even more surprisingly, a salad bar. The fish fries quickly in Dane and is far better than youd expect. The cod is undoubtedly supplied by Sysco and predictably of average quality. It presumably comes as a big fillet thats been frozen for an unknown amount of time, which is then thawed, cut, breaded, and fried. While that might not seem like anything special (and its not) the breading applied turns the run-of-the-mill fish into much, much more. Its crispy, well-seasoned, and simply delicious. There are a couple potato options and like a fool I chose the crinkle cut fries instead of the hash browns. The fries are fine, but thats about it. The tartar comes in a big squeeze bottle, and thus is essentially AYCE. The thick and zesty brew makes the fish (and the fries) disappear even more quickly than it would have otherwise. When coleslaw is the topic of the conversation slightly better than average is acceptable. The creamy concoction had some pop but took a backseat (like way back) to the cod. Value is an important aspect when youre talking about lunch and this is one hell of a deal for seven skins. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry, and will come back any time we are after small town prices with big time taste. www.facebook.com/pages/Peg-Docs-Sports-Bar-Grill/104962512879752?sk=wall106 Dane StreetDane, WI 53529     (608) 829-6475",1782,0.265079365079365,0.4505411255411255

Peg & Docs sure isnt fancy, but boy, their fish sure is great.P&Ds is a little hole in the wall up in Dane but what it lacks in size it makes up for in value. During the lunchhour the tiny tavern has a 2-piece fried cod for seven bucks, and unlike a lot of places that reserve it for dinner, also offer a baked version. I hit the lunch rush this Friday, but of course in Dane you tend to take the term rush with a grain of salt. There were about 10 patrons including myself in the bar, which you might think would put them behind the eight ball, but my food still came out in flash. It was hot as can be and looked scrumptious. The cod was flaky, but didnt appear to be top quality once I ripped into it. Still, it was coupled with a light, crunchy breading that masked any imperfections with a salty satisfaction. Sometimes a good breading can make all the difference in the world and this one definitely does. The big squeeze bottle of thick tartar that lived on the bar has the consistency you desire and the zip you crave. It really worked well with the savory breading making the so-so meat but a distant memory. The hash browns with cheese and onion also put any concerns with quality in the rearview with a gooey deliciousness, and nice balance. Fries or baked potato were also available for those wanting to change things up a bit, but these hash browns are not to be missed. Theres just something about a flat-top grill and shredded spuds. Finishing of the Fry was some finely-chopped slaw with an excellent zest. I say finishing off because there was no bread to tackle that task. Tsk-tsk.This is flat-out a hard Fish Fry to argue with. Its far from fancy, but the food is downright tasty, and for $7 there really isnt anything to complain about (even an absent starch). Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and will come back any time we dont want feel like dicking (or Doc-ing) around. www.facebook.com/pages/Peg-Docs-Sports-Bar-Grill/104962512879752?sk=wall106 Dane StreetDane, WI 53529     (608) 829-6475",2081,0.20961805555555557,0.5493518518518518

But who am I kidding? I am trying  repeat  trying (and usually failing). Of course, it doesnt help that I have fish obsessed friends who call up at the last minute and suggest lunchtime corruption and afternoons of drinking, but these things happen.Jer had the day off and since I am easily persuaded I decided to take him to one of my lesser-known Fish Fry enclaves. By 12:40 the hustle and bustle of the city was in our rearview and the quaint village of Dane the windshield. We parked on the diagonal in front of Peg & Docs, and were inside the small town bar in the blink of an eye. At lunch time the Dane dive features a 2-piece cod Fish Fry for $6.50, as well as a couple other options that we have yet to (and likely never will) try. We ordered a round of the fish, some Rhinelander Shorties and a couple shots of homemade Apple Pie Liquor. The pie quickly warmed our bellies and the steaming hot fish arrived about 15 minutes later. As I have come to expect the cod was great. The fish was moist and flaky and paired with a light and delicious breading. While a small amount of grease developed it really only served to keep the fish moist and didnt ruin the breading one bit. The fish had the essence of our beloved Wilsons but since it was moister the flavors were enhanced. Simply superb stuff. Equally stunning were the hash browns with cheese and onion. The homemade shreds were perfectly fried and sported the mandatory slice of good ol American on top. Likewise, the tartar was to spec featuring a thick creamy base and the relish zest we know and love. We didnt expect any bread with the fish so we werent surprised when none showed up. Turns out, had we been bold enough to ask they would have given us a dinner roll, which was apparently phased out due to unpopularity. On the other hand, the coleslaw was in effect, and clearly a favorite with the crowd in Dane. It was nice and creamy, basically just what it is supposed to be. Eventually we would make our way back to Madison, but not before a couple more shorties in Dane, a pint at Mojos, and a couple Landjägers from the butcher shop in Waunakee. To think, it all started with a tasty little lunch at Peg & Docs. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry, and thank our lack of will power for another fantastic Friday. www.facebook.com/pages/Peg-Docs-Sports-Bar-Grill/104962512879752?sk=wall106 Dane StreetDane, WI 53529     (608) 829-6475",2608,0.21407608695652178,0.5784057971014493

The Carhartt clad workers come through the sunlit doors no later than five-after, and in order to beat them to the punch wise patrons set their sights on 11:30. At 11:30 the bar is relatively empty, The Cosby Show is on the TV, and fish is served in the blink of an eye. Most places don't offer baked cod at lunch (it's a lot more work than fried), but in addition to the wonderful fried cod, Peg and Doc's gives the oven option. For $6.50 the 2-piece fried is a steal. A young fry cook has figured it all out, creating cod which is light and flaky, with a delicious, flaky breading to match. It is almost unthinkable how fast one can eat two pieces of fish when they are this delicate, and taste this good. Grease simply doesn't stand a chance, as the fish is gone too fast for it to even try to take hold. While the frying is done behind closed doors (in truth there is no door, but the kitchen is around a corner sort ofﾅ) the burgers and hash browns are done on the flattop grill in the bar. Those who sit at the bar are treated to a grilling display, and privy to a little insider info. The fries come from 'round back and look like basic bagged crinkles, but are thick and possibly homemade. Peg & Doc's doesn't skimp either, and the potato portions easily outlast a 2-piece fish (it would likely even beat a 3). Fry fans will like these, but more adventurous spudsters will find the hash browns with cheese & onion a bit more rewarding. Homemade tartar is the icing of the proverbial cake, and Peg & Doc's is the master baker. Their sauce is a saccharine nectar featuring a thick and creamy mayo base, with just enough relish to take the focus off the tangy mayo. It pairs perfectly with the savory cod adding a fine finishing touch.Good slaw can be hard to come by. Some is too watery, other are too limp. The balance of zest to creaminess is a fickle mistress, and most places go too far one way or the other. Peg & Doc's finds the juicy middle with their incredibly creamy, homemade offering which is set-off with pungent flavors far beyond that of mere cabbage. The Fish Fry at Peg & Doc'sis highly recommendable, and easily one of the best deals around. It's no wonder that nearly every stool is full on Friday. The good folks of Dane demand value, and Peg & Doc's delivers.www.facebook.com/pages/Peg-Docs-Sports-Bar-Grill/104962512879752?sk=wall106 Dane StreetDane, WI 53529     (608) 829-6475",2452,0.19028333333333333,0.5956095238095238

Whether its the comedy you secretly watch on the BBC that none of your friends know about, or that little BBQ place on the east side that serves the best ribs in the world but is never busy, these secret treasures make us feel special and in the know. MFF has been to just about every Fish Fry joint in the area and thought wed turned every stone there was to turn. Apparently we missed at least one, and somehow Peg & Docs in the tiny village of Dane slipped through the cracks. An aptly named Dane Street was surprisingly busy, but I lucked into an open parking spot, and made my way over to Peg & Docs without delay. As I expected, much of the congestion outside could be attributed to the bevy of patrons inside the small town tavern. The bar was totally full, save for the lone spot I was able to secure on the far side. The small dining room was also open for lunch, but since I was rolling solo I just grabbed the stool, and wedged my way in.The bartender was plenty busy, but swung right by and grabbed me a 10 oz. Cow. Those 10 ouncers go down pretty quick, so when she came back about five minutes later for my food order I was sure to snag another one. For lunch Peg & Docs features a $6.50 2-piece cod, and mine arrived about five minutes after my order for it went in. There were quite a few orders of fish around the bar so I had an inkling as to what it was going to look like, but when I finally got a close-up its beauty really came into focus. From outward appearances the cod was lightly breaded and had some spice to it. While looks can be deceiving, this fish was true to form it somehow tasted even better than it looked. It was incredibly light and flaky, and went down so smoothly it was almost like it wasnt even there. The breading was exceptionally flavorful and paired elegantly with feathery fish. It was simply amazing and literally some of the best cod Ive had  no joke.Partnering perfectly with the cod was a homemade tartar which was thick, creamy and zesty  everything a tartar should be.  While the fish had so much flavor of its own that it barely needed the sublime sauce, although it did enhance those bites it touched. Following suit were the hash browns with cheese and onion which were almost as amazing as the fish, but not quite. The house-shredded spuds were heavy on the onion, fried to perfection. After their crisping they were covered with a slice of American cheese which was lovingly folded in once adequately melted. They were expertly done, and balanced the wispiness of the fish with a little greasy fortitude.Finishing off the lunch plate was a thick and creamy coleslaw, which was also assumed to be homemade. While the slaw was perfectly acceptable it did have a bit of an odd twinge that wasnt enough to make it unappealing, but enough to make me think twice about finishing all of it.The one detractor to the meal (if there was one) was the absence of bread, but since it is lunch that is to be expected. When we come back it will be for P & Ds full-blown Friday Fish dinner which gets a bump in price to $11, but also includes soup, salad bar, and rolls.Some hunters seek deer, others seek treasure. At MFF we seek great fish, and this week we got ourselves that 12-pointer; a trophy buck that we feel like could easily become a mainstay in a local Fish Fry rotation. The fish was simply superb and supported by expert sides - no wonder the place was packed. Overall, we highly recommend the Fish Fry at Peg & Docs based on this experience, and simply cannot wait to come back for the full meal deal. www.facebook.com/pages/Peg-Docs-Sports-Bar-Grill/104962512879752?sk=wall106 Dane StreetDane, WI 53529     (608) 829-6475",3727,0.17138994708994712,0.48550158730158727

While I understand what they were going for (pairing the smooth fish with a zesty batter), it was a bit much for the senses, and when you take into account the tartar had its own share of dill, it really was a bit over the top. All that said, the overall flavor was still acceptable and we had no problem taking down a full five pieces. Brice was feeling a little giddy, or so it seemed, and beyond bellying up to the curds, he also branched out with the lake perch plate. The perch featured a similar batter to the haddock, which was good, but needed a kick. It was a little too thick for the perch to handle, and while the fish was flaky and delicate it didnt quite hold up. It was also overwhelmed somewhat by the over-dilled tartar, which to its credit was thick and creamy, and didnt have much visible dill, but believe me it was there...

While I'm not a ""foodie,"" dude is a real chef and I told him I'd come by the downtown Gritty sometime to see what he was going to do with their Fish Fry (which historically was not good). Turns our Ryno is a beast in the kitchen and has turned a once awful Fish Fry on its head. Here's what I think about it...While his fish is not a cheapy ($14.75) I'd say it's worth what you get. Four fat chunks of cod come in the wax paper lined basket and are head and shoulder above the beer battered nightmare of yesterday. These prime chunks are home to a heavily-seasoned dark brown breading that is brined in beer beforehand to the point that a dark ring was evident - much like a smoke ring you'd find on a good brisket. The fish itself was flaky and pure and formed a very nice dichotomy with the crunchy coating. Sides abound at the Nitty and the spicy waffle fries wound up being a smart choice. These babies are straight out of the Dexter's mold and as satisfying as the come. The tartar on the other hand didn't really do it for me as it was kinda thin and didn't pack the punch to take the fish to the next level. It's tough to tell if the Kirb slaw was made in-house, but didn't look like Sysco to me. Either way, it was good and more than satisfying. There was also no bread, which for a Fish Fry made by a dude from the north woods left me scratching my head. Oh well, it was lunch so maybe there's a slab of rye come dinner time? It should be noted that Mr. Kirby did recognize me sitting at the bar, but it wasn't until after I'd ordered and had the food in front of me. I am the everyman, and the last thing I want is any sort of special treatment (extra pieces, bonus fries, etc). Had I announced that I was there I almost certainly would have received something so I'm glad it worked out that way it did which gave his fish center stage. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and will definitely come back again. Who knows maybe next time I'll order it ""Buffalo Style"" as he recommends...I just need some other people to order it that way before I do so he won't know it's me doing it...*hint hint* www.nittygrittybirthdayplace.com223 N.

While that is definitely a great thing, it doesnt tell you much about to their food, and after overhearing a conversation among their employees who were recommending Fitzgeralds, apparently even they know it isnt exactly the Fish Fry Bar of Madison.I showed up at the Nitty for an early lunch and grabbed a stool at the bar because I was rollin solo, as my fishy friends happened to be otherwise occupied. I quickly grabbed a Cow and put in my order for the $10 Gritty Fish Fry at the same time. I got about half way through the beer in about 7 minutes and just as I did my super long Fish Fry basket appeared from the kitchen. It was fresh fried and ready to go - so was I. At first bite it was immediately apparent that the fish was good, but not top notch. While it was fairly flaky it was rather bland, and had accumulated a tiny bit of that white fish-gel stuff between the flakes due to some grease that was present. The grease fully saturated the second piece, and by the time I reached the end the batter had gotten a little mushy and fairly unappetizing. Speaking of the batter, it looked really good when the fish first appeared but was lacking any real flavor. There was clearly some spice, as black pepper was clearly evident, but unfortunately the taste did not come through. At the least, it was nice and hot up until the end, which is something not much, but something.Partnered with the two average sized cod fillets was a veritable pant-load of Nitty fries. This drove of skin-on Julienne cut potatoes followed suit with the fish in that they were well fried, but nothing special. The tartar sauce was also nothing special and I would say it was well below average. It stood on a thick mayo foundation, but deviated from the ideal mayo/relish ratio with a hefty dousing of the latter. Whats more, it was a sweet relish, which really gave it an odd twinge and didnt improve the pedestrian cod one bit. The slaw was also in abundance, but like pretty much everything else, the finely chopped mixture was uninspired, and just not tasty in any way. Most of mine sat uneaten until the point the bartender removed it from my sight.Based on their performance up until this point this was not going to be a recommendable Fish Fry anyway, but when we realized that there was no bread of any sort included the camels back was officially broken. It was definitely the final straw and a lackluster end to a mediocre meal.Overall, at $10 this just doesnt add up to a recommendable Fish Fry. Everything was just so-so and even spectacular service from the friendly bartender wasnt enough to save the day. The only thing that shined was the service and the speed with which the food was served, but I gotta chalk some of that up to the fact they just opened and I was literally one of the very first people in for lunch. The Nitty is still definitely the place to go on your birthday, just make sure that if it falls on a Friday, you get your fish fix somewhere else before you head over for the bottomless beer. www.nittygrittybirthdayplace.com223 N.

Yes, you can get a drink, but youd better be prepared to hang around the Vets at the VFW, or on the bar side of your local supper club to get it. Bars simply do not exist, not even clean, well-kept ones like Montes Pub and Grill in Verona. Damned city ordinancesWe can only imagine how a place like Montes would do back home, but presume it would be an unrivaled success. Our crew of four showed up just a bit after the noon hour and, a plucked the first 4-person high-top table we saw. On Friday the lunch special at Montes consists of a 2-piece fish complete with all the standard trimmings. Once the sole waitress came by and grabbed our order, it took 15 minutes longer for the eight dollar platters show up. At first site, the cod looked very good. At first bite these suspicions were confirmed. The fish was light, and surprisingly flaky, but did get pretty greasy the longer it sat. The grease wasnt overpowering, and didnt ruin the fish, but did leave a sheen on the plate that glistened in the Verona afternoon sunlight that poured through the mini-mall windows. The amount of grease that accumulated was somewhat surprising since the breading on fish was light and flaky, which usually means less of the undesirable ooze. Thankfully the breading also had a little extra spice which counteracted the overactive oil, and made for a pleasurable experience. A run-of-the-mill small-town sports bar should have fries to match, and Montes spuds fit that mold to a T. Likewise, the thick and creamy tartar was par for the course, and helped overcome the grease the cod kicked up. A raw tasting side of slaw boasted a ton of horseradish which perked it up, but by and large fell on deaf ears. While a little plain dinner roll played through, and came away no worse for the wear. Fries, tartar, slaw, and rolls: all acceptable, none outstanding. It turns out that Montes is a nice small-town sports bar, which it also turns out, is just what MFFs hometown needs. This is a simple no-nonsense Fish Fry which covers all its bases, but leaves room for improvement. Overall, were willing to recommend it at this time, and would come back again.montesverona.com608A West Verona AvenueVerona, WI 53593     (608) 845-9669",2308,0.17165915281299898,0.45332394101624873

They were home to a light breading that was the perfect thickness and had just the right amount of spice in it. It was simply superb, and I would definitely not hesitate to get it again. I also got to try a bit of the cod and it was tasty, but not as tasty as the bluegill. The ocean dweller was rich, creamy, flaky, and consistent  everything youd like cod to be. As mentioned earlier, the French fries were abundant and expertly fried. They shared the shape, size, and texture of McDonalds fries, and could well have been a bag stolen right out of their freezer for all I know. They were that good.

Small town bars like these are off the beaten path, mostly patronized by a few loyal regulars, and have a propensity to offer the best in world of fried foods. When folks like MFF come strutting through the door of a place like the Rack we usually get a few cross looks, but when we belly up to the bar and order up a Fish Fry the gazes subside and the locals realize were here for cheap beer and fried fish, just like they are.The lunch special in Morrisonville runs six bucks and starts with two 4 oz. cod chunks which are further flanked by fries, a small Solo of tartar, and topped off by a multigrain roll. Strangely, there is no slaw in this show which is a bit odd when it comes to tavern Fish Frys, but we rolled with that punch.Our lunch specials arrived about 15 minutes after our orders went in and the fish was freshly fried and screaming hot. The cod was covered in a dark beer batter that had an appetizing, but not quite textbook taste. The unique coating was almost smoky and led me to believe that the frying medium may have needed a switch. Regardless, it was still tasty and distinctive as the cod was likely imparted with the taste of many-a fried entrée past. While there fish almost certainly wasnt what youd call fresh, it was flaky and devoid of grease which is a win in our book.The standard freezer-to-fryer fries did their part but little more. The portion was fair, and the spuds were there, so who are we to complain? Unlike the unadorned tubers, the tartar was transcendent as the goo was heavy on the mayo, with just enough relish to keep it interesting - Just how Is likes it.Last, but not least, was a nice multigrain roll, which if nothing else, was a step up from the standard tear-off dinner roll. At least some thought went into taking it beyond the norm, and hey, a little room temp butter can do amazing thingsAll in all, little more than 30 minutes passed before we were out the door with a belly full of fish. We quite enjoyed our soirée at Tamarack II and would not hesitate to return again. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry, and have to say it is a deal and a half at only six bucks.4684 County Rd DMMorrisonville, WI 53571     (608) 846-5005",2351,0.10885568513119534,0.4580174927113702

It's easily some of the best freshwater fish in the city and comes complete with all the trimmings - rye bread AND a legit relish tray among them. When they branched out and added lake perch to the lineup a couple years ago we were intrigued, but also a little surprised since the specialty walleye seemed like more that enough. It turns out the beer battered perch was indeed interesting, but didn't hit the same notes the walleye struck. It was recently phased out in favor of beer battered haddock which was definitely the right move on their part.The leathery beer batter works infinitely better on the haddock than it did on the perch, since there is so much more meat to offset substantial seasoning - the perch was basically lost underneath it. This stuff has a pungent pepper flavor that rules the roost with and holds the flaky fish together extremely well. Like the walleye and the perch before it, the portion is generous and well worth the $14 cost of admission. Two potato pancakes form a starchy substrate for the fish and are as king sized as they come. They featured an idyllic dark brown crust and lightly charred flavor. They are some of the only latkes in the town and pair perfectly with either the accompanying apple sauce or sour cream spreaders. If there is any detractor to this Fish Fry it would be that the homemade tartar is on the thin side, but that is pretty petty. This stuff gets the job done, and takes the fish up a tiny notch. The homemade slaw also plays its role without much acclaim, and just does what is supposed to do. While we always felt the walleye was more than adequate as their Friday special, we're pretty pleased with Stalzy's haddock as well. It is actually different enough that it provides a totally unique offering for those who may not like the taste of freshwater fish, unlike the perch. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and think it was a wise change for the deli to make. stalzysdeli.com/2701 Atwood AveMadison, WI 53704     (608) 249-7806",2069,0.228667328042328,0.5733002645502645

After all, this wasn't just some fish-n-chips affair; Stalzy's Fry was the full meal deal - complete with a relish tray! And it's still just $16!Everything at Stalzy's is made in-house and it starts with said relish tray. Some pickled veg, a couple carrots, a few sticks of celery, and a trio of radishes make it up and sit alongside a bevy of freshly baked breads. It's a impressive starter and more than a lot of supper clubs even offer in this day and age. Some of the best slaw out there comes along too with a cool and creamy balance that most slaws can't strike. Before you can get all the way through the the relish the fish is bound to show up and it's an impressive sight to behold. A big old heap of freshwater fillets usually sit criss-crossed on each other after being split into pan-friendly portions. These monsters are home to an ultra-crispy breading that has enough seasoning to be noticed, but relies mostly upon its texture. The bulk of the flavor comes from the fish and these numbers are as flaky and flavorful as all get out. Stalzy's is one of the only places in town with potato pancakes so even though they are also one of the only places in town with German potato salad the 'cakes always take precedence. Two huge suckers were splayed across the bottom of the plate and served as a makeshift mattress for the weary walleye. They had a sort of odd sweetness about them which was nothing off-putting but not the onion-y blast we prefer in our pancakes. Luckily, the sour cream and homemade apple sauce on the side did the trick. Way too little tartar came for such a massive portion of fish, but more arrived immediately upon request. This house blend is on the thin side, but really diverse and gives the fish a slight bump in the savory department. It's puzzling to me how this Fish Fry is still seemingly under the radar. Perhaps it's because they don't have the standard cod - walleye and lake perch only, or the fact that none of it is deep fried? Regardless, this is one to be reckoned with and one we'll keep coming back to time and again.

The moment I laid lips on that walleye I knew it was something special and something Id come back for time and again. Stalzys walleye Fish Fry is a ½ pound affair, runs a cool 16 bones, and comes fully loaded. It starts off with a full-fledged relish tray and bread plate. Its as classic as most supper clubs offer and probably higher quality than theirs. The white and rye breads are baked in-house, and as fresh as they come. A few raw carrots, celery, and radishes share the plate, along with a scaled-back cup of slaw. This revamped slaw is a new and improved vinegar-based blend that is fresh tasting and delicious. Two hulking walleye fillets follow the apps and look like something out of a storybook. The fat buggers are home to Stalzys own dark and crispy breading that some might think looks burned, but believe me its not. While the breading doesnt have a lot of seasoning the crunch of the coating offsets the flaky fish perfectly. Its a flavor combo that rivals the best out there. Stalzys has improved their potato pancakes over the years and the current cakes are large and in charge. They play mattress to the fishs comforter and are cooked until the edges are bubbling off the griddle while the centers remain supple. While they dont have much of the onion flavor traditional PPs are known for, the sour cream and homemade apple sauce on the side make up for it. Last on the list is some homemade tartar and if youre like me youll need a second cup of the saucy sauce...of course, it didnt help that my first ramekin was only about ¼ full. The diminutive portion was their only failing, if there was a failing Stalzys is a deli and as such most people wouldnt expect much in the way of a Fish Fry, but what people need to realize is that while Stalzys may be a deli its a deli in Wisconsin. Their Fish Fry is as good as you will find in any tavern or supper club and although it may seem expensive it easily justifies the price with craft and quantity.

Stalzys walleye is a force to be reckoned with and since its always been the only fish on their menu theres hasnt been much else to think about come Friday. But lo and behold, the times they are a changin. They have recently addedwait for itlake perch! And not just that, lake perch with Hamms beer batter! Needless to say, I knew what needed to be done.Like the walleye, the perch comes in on the high end at $16, but includes ALL the trimmings which helps to justify the price. We were in early and the food began rolling our way almost instantly starting with the relish tray, breads, and coleslaw. A few carrots, some celery, and radishes got things going and really set the scene nicely. They cozied up to the rye, and made friends with a fresh white roll. They shared the love with an abundant bowl of slaw that is as creamy as any you will ever see. It was a beautiful friendship as everything present was fresh and carefully prepped. The perch lurched our way not long after and was every bit as impressive looking as the apps (if you want to call them that). This fish is a strange dichotomy if there ever was one. On one hand, the Hamms-based batter was delicious and had a flavor that was truly unique - Im not sure Ive ever tasted any better quite like it. However, putting a thick beer batter on a delicate fish like lake perch is a no-no as it totally masks its mild flavors. The perch seemed to be high quality and flaky, but it was impossible to tell since the batter simply overrode it. Put this batter on some cod or haddock and it would be one for the ages, but on the perch its just a bit much. So, while the perch missed the mark a little the potato pancakes were flawless. These cakes are the real deal, and the two diminutive discs used to be delicious but slightly unsatisfying. Thankfully, they have shifted into top gear and the two sprawling pancakes of today practically covered the entire plate. They are thin and crispy and looked to have been bubbling off the griddle. The apple sauce and sour cream on the side really put them over the top and I have no qualms about saying these could well be the best potato option in Madison. No joke. The small side of tartar couldnt stand up to the fish and got gobbled up by the brawny batter. It was hard to tell if it was actually good or not since the batter took control, but based on our previous experiences I know it was. Stalzys continues to fly under the radar to some extent as this is easily so of the best fish in town but they are never really that busy on Friday nights. Thats all well and good for me though since I want it, and the less people that show up the better my chances are of getting it. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and will no doubt be back to prance with the perch or waltz with the walleye again very soon. stalzysdeli.com/2701 Atwood AveMadison, WI 53704     (608) 249-7806",3001,0.19919398907103825,0.5113283892792091

Stalzys Deli represents Fish Fry a lot better than places that have been doing it a lot longer than they have, and that puts a smile on my face. They only have walleye, and it costs $16, but it comes with all, and I mean ALL, the trimmings.After your $16 order is dropped at the counter a relish tray, a bowl of slaw, and bread will find their way to your booth or table. The relish tray will feature carrots, celery, and radishes; the slaw will be cool and creamy; and the bread will overflow the plate with three different home baked styles -- rye, white, and sourdough (although Im not really sure on that one).The fish will come quickly after that (depending on how busy they are), and look impressive. Two chunky walleye fillets with a light and crispy panko-style breading fill the plate, are flaky as can be, and really quite beautiful. The breading is crumbly and inviting with a noticeable amount of black pepper (noticeable in a good way). German potato salad or potato pancakes are the side choices and I always go for the cakes. They are smooth and creamy in the middle and thin and crispy on the edges. While they dont have a ton of flavor on their own the ramekins of apple sauce and sour cream give them the kick they need. Another ramekin comes filled with house-made tartar which does all it needs to do but doesnt amaze. Then again, it doesnt need to as the walleye does that all on its own. While $16 may sound like a lot for some fried fish, it is actually quite reasonable considering all you get. A ½ lb. of fish is generous, the sides are done right, and you get all the supper club style add-ons to boot.

I dont think Im alone when I say that taking kids (especially ones that are two months old) out for fish is not the easiest of tasks. Most of the good places have long waits on Friday nights and for some reason kids just dont seem to like hanging out and having a couple drinks at the bar (strange, I know). This is why weve gone to Stalzys Deli a couple of times recently. Not only does Stalzys have a great Fish Fry, but they usually arent very busy on Friday nights. UsuallyWe touted the accessibility of Stalzys in our last review, and perhaps word got out? Im not sure if we have that much clout, but this trip to the Atwood Avenue eatery was a significantly different story. It was about as busy as Stalzys can possibly be and basically ever seat was taken. I was shocked. Luckily for us, a family in a similar situation noticed our arrival and quickly finished their dinner to avail us of their table. It was very generous of them and clearly one of those unspoken rules of parenting. We ordered at the deli counter, dropped a tip in the jar, and had a seat without so much as a peep from junior. Things were going (surprisingly) well. On our previous visit I got a whole bread plate/relish tray just for me. This time around we had two fish eaters but still only got the one plate. While the carrots, celery, radishes, and bread were still more than enough, the single cup of slaw went quickly. Regardless, it was still a lot more than most places include with their fish so you really cant complain. The rye was righteous and the slaw was made in-house and had a near-perfect consistency. Since it was busy, the fish took a while to fry which was a total one eighty from our previous visit. When it did show its fins the pieces were large, but not as big as weve come to expect. The fish was pristine, and flaky, but fried longer so everything was a little firmer. The resulting breading was crispier, making the fish a little less desirable than flawless walleye weve become accustomed to. Next up were the potato pancakes which were disappointing to say the least. They still had their trademark taste but were clearly fried well before the fish and served cold. The lukewarm cakes made the accompanying applesauce and sour cream 100% necessary. The last variable in the equation was Stalzys tartar which was the same thin, but tasty blend. It coated the crispy walleye adequately, but as weve said in the past, was far from ideal. Places that have great fish and no wait on Friday are few and far between. These are the unicorns of the Fish Fry world and some of the few spots where you can actually take an infant and hope to get in and out without a total meltdown. Stalzys has historically been one of these mythical beasts, but I fear the cat may be out of the bag. This time around wasnt as easy as we hoped itd be, but it was still manageable (even if the food did regress somewhat). Overall, we still highly recommend the walleye Fish Fry at Stalzys Deli, and will likely be back to try our luck again soon. stalzysdeli.com/2701 Atwood AveMadison, WI 53704     (608) 249-7806",3249,0.09119047619047618,0.4772781131231836

They really should be.While a New York style delicatessen may not be the first place that jumps to mind when people think about Friday Fish Stalzys at least deserves some consideration. On Friday they offer up a whale of a Fish Fry and while it is on the high side price-wise (at $16) I would argue that it is actually well worth every bit of that cheddar. Allow me to explain. First things first, Stalzys Fish Fry is one of the most traditional you will find, even though its not served at the most traditional of establishments. Before the fish comes they provide four slices of bread, and big old bowl of coleslaw, and a miniature relish tray All for just one person! The relish tray is a simple one, composed of a few carrots, celery, and some radishes, but when you consider that most places dont even have the relish tray on their radar any more it is quite the little (unexpected) perk. The bread plate also exceeds expectations with two slices of pumpernickel rye partnering up with a couple slabs of soft white. Whats more, all the breads are made in-house which really lets you know how serious Stalzys is about quality. Finally, the slaw is a well-balanced rendition which, like everything else, is made with care in-house. Long strands of cabbage mingle with mayo and a few shreds of carrot producing a middling textured slaw that could use some jump but is well balanced and extremely appetizing. If you can somehow make it through the plethora on this initial plate what appears before you next might be a tad overwhelming. Stalzys walleye is the main attraction, and it is a behemoth if there ever was one. The stated portion of ½ lb. actually seems to be on the light side as the two huge walleye fillets dwarf the plate and really grab your attention. The pieces are incredibly fat throughout and at least a good inch-and-a-half thick in the center. In addition, these fillets arent just big, but the fish is incredibly moist and flaky with little to no grease to speak of. Each of these monsters is coated in a light, crumbly breading that adds a subtle crispy texture and a great peppery flavor to the fish. It also clings incredibly well leaving no bite un-breaded (which is a feat in and of itself when the fish is this hearty). Somewhere under the two walleye giants you will find a couple of Stalzys homemade potato pancakes (which seem to be growing over time). They are still thin (which you like to see) but are apparently spreading out, perhaps to keep in proportion with their fishy friends? Each of the cakes has crispy edges and soft centers, and taste okay on their own, but really shine when slathered with the supplied apple sauce and/or sour cream. Last on Stalzys list is their homemade tartar sauce which tastes fine, but is really thin. Despite its consistency it actually pairs well with the fish since walleye is so substantial. Also, since the fish is so flavorful it really doesnt need any help so it isnt a problem that the sauce isnt perfect. Madison, Im not sure what your aversion to Stalzys is, but take our word for it that this is a Fish Fry you have got to try. Everything is done with care and attention to detail which makes for an experience well worthy of 1600 measly cents. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and it currently tops our list of places that have great fish but without the great wait you expect on Friday night in Wisconsin. stalzysdeli.com/2701 Atwood AveMadison, WI 53704     (608) 249-7806",3601,0.15533831465338319,0.4770931427780743

Everything is clean and compartmentalized such that nothing on plate touches this, or soaks into that. Its a hallmark of Stalzys style, and something that really sets them (and their Fish Fry) apart from everything else. $16.00 isnt exactly cheap for a Fish Fry, but when youre talking fresh, and youre talking hand-made like you are at the Atwood Avenue destination, it is justifiable. Just like everything else at Stalzys, the Friday night special is an order-at-the-counter affair which involves bussing your own dishes when youre done. As mentioned above, everything is made to order, so it takes a good 15 minutes for your food to be ready (if you get there at a good time and there isnt a line in front of you, that is). Your sixteen skins pays for two platefuls of food. The first is a large dinner plate with two generous walleye fillets (which are probably at least the quoted ½ pound), a couple potato pancakes, a massive cup of coleslaw, and ramekins of: tartar, apple sauce, and sour cream. The second plate is smaller, but overflows with fresh rye and French bread slices. The dual plate methodology allows for everything to stay separate, which keeps mixing to a minimum. It winds up being a lot of food for one person, and can be shared, but quickly becomes a small portion when done (as our friends Bri and Tyler found out). If you are in the sharing mood, Id suggest ordering an additional side of potato pancakes since they go quick, and even the two that come with the full meal arent quite enough. The walleye will be juicy and flaky, but not at all greasy. The fillets used at Stalzys are incredibly meaty, but light and elegant at the same time. The fish is coated in a crumbly, well-seasoned breading that punctuates the smooth fish with a welcomed spark. It is a great flavor combo that easily stands on its own. Being that the fish is so flavorful it doesnt need much in the way of tartar, and that is exactly what Stalzys delivers. The house-made sauce is a little runny, but since the walleye doesnt need it, the mild taste it provides doesnt hinder anything. It really serves as more of a change of pace if, and when, you want it. Like the high-grade fish, the potato pancakes are superb. They are light and fluffy, with crispy edges that add a satisfying crunch. Theyre paired with Stalzys house-made applesauce and some sour cream, which really put the smooth starchy goodness over the top. If only there were a couple more of them. If onlyThe last item on the big plate is a sizeable cup of fresh coleslaw. The homebrew is a good one, but probably the least appealing of everything on the plate (which speaks more to the quality of everything else and not a lackluster slaw). It houses a little horseradish, and a thick cream, but simply pales in comparison to its contemporaries. The bread plate is more impressive, featuring three big slices of house-baked rye, and a couple of French. Oui oui. As someone who is obsessive with their Fish Frys, I can honestly say I have slightly compulsive cravings for this one. Its a little strange, but I find the lack of disorder very appealing, and appreciate the organization Stalzys brings to the table. Overall, I highly recommend this Fish Fry, and think its actually a fair value (which is really saying something at $16). Its Crisp. Its Delicious. Its Stalzys. stalzysdeli.com/2701 Atwood AveMadison, WI 53704     (608) 249-7806",3490,0.25085213032581444,0.5008395989974935

Conventional wisdom would also have you believe that $16 is an exorbitant amount for any meal not including a big old hunk of steak or some sort of fancy crustacean. When it comes to Stalzys Deli you can take all that conventional crap and throw it out the window. They are currently making one mean Fish Fry and while it will cost ya, it will be worth every stinking penny.Now, you wont find MFF endorsing too many high priced plates of fish, and at $16 youd probably think we wouldnt want anything to do with this one, but youd be wrong. While the price might be higher than average, the portion is gigundo, and every single element is done with care. It is a rare animal indeed, and perhaps the most traditional Fish Fry in town (if you find walleye traditional, that is). While it wont arrive in the blink of an eye (ours took about 15 minutes), it will come freshly fried and look simply amazing. One large plate wasnt even enough to hold the massive amount of food that appeared in front of me with the bread necessitating a side dish. The bread plate came with two full slices  one rye and one French so as not to discriminate against the rye-haters. Both styles were very nice, but the rye in particular paired excellently with homemade coleslaw. The slaw was of the creamy variety and while it was crisp and fresh it could have used a bit more pop (this is a very petty complaint on our part though, it was still very good). The main plate featured two massive chunks of walleye, two thin, but wide potato pancakes, and ramekins of tartar, apple sauce, and sour cream (the sour cream unfortunately went to waste since the apple sauce more than sufficed for my two cakes). The fish was nothing less than superb. The fillets were fat, and chunky with an ultra-flaky texture. They were incredibly moist and succulent without the slightest hint of grease. They were home to a very flavorful and crumby breading that begged to be eaten. The well-seasoned coating mingled with the fish, playing its subtle saltiness off the fishs gentle texture. It was sheer eating enjoyment and while the ½ pound of walleye might be too much for many, I made my way through it with ease it was simply too good not to. Likewise the potato pancakes were stellar. They were wafer-thin but still featured crispy edges and supple interiors. They paired amazingly well with the apple sauce which had wishing more would have come even though the plate was already overflowing with food. So good. Keeping with the homemade theme was the tartar sauce which was a thin, but creamy rendition. The super sauce provided a peppy punch that totally worked the fish over and somehow stuck it out until the end. The fact that it lasted to the end is a real testament to how delicious the fish was since the tartar portion was small while the fish was ultra-plentiful. Since Stalzys is a deli you pay upfront which means there is no waitress to tip later on. Thus, you basically have your tip is included in the $16 price tag which makes the cost not loom so largely (although its still cool to throw a buck or two in the tip jar on the counter). Whats more, since the portion is so large it is probably a sharable size for a lot of couples out there (not me of course, but some couples maybe). Overall, I highly recommend this Fish Fry and believe it is one of the best Madison has to offer right now. stalzysdeli.com/2701 Atwood AveMadison, WI 53704     (608) 249-7806",3593,0.17570261989093156,0.5144978073874178

Once you get into the upper end of that price range you are talking about premium fish options and are often looking at an All You Can Eat scenario. I mean, were talking fish, not filet mignon here. Well, there is a new Fish Fry on the block, with a new delivery model, and price tag which might shock those not prepared for it.The Walleye for Two at Stalzys is this latest entry into Madisons Friday Fish scene, and I must say even we were taken aback when we first saw the price - $32! Now, as you may know, you can pretty much consider Stalzys to be a gourmet deli which of course comes complete with gourmet prices. They hang their hat on quality and seem to use it to justify charging about 15% more than people expect across the board - the Fish Fry being no exception. Ill at least try to look at it objectively Since it is for two it all boils down to one large walleye fillet, two potato pancakes, a heap of slaw, four small slices of bread, and tons of tartar per person ($16). Now, 16 skins is still on the high-end for a Fish Fry, but I can honestly say the cost is somewhat justified. Somewhat being the operative word here. For starters, the service was fine, and we got our fish (which almost everyone in the place seemed to be splurging on) about 20 minutes after we ordered. It was nice and hot all around and served in a pleasing family style manner that made it easy to take what you wanted. The walleye is billed as pan-fried which usually means a thin, almost translucent breading with noticeable char around the edges. Stalzys fish bucked this trend, and in lieu of the wafer thin coatings were accustomed to, their walleye had a Panko-style breading that was evenly coated throughout, much more Shake-n-Bake-y than expected. However, just because it wasnt what was expected doesnt mean in wasnt delicious, as the crispy coating blended very well with the incredibly thick and meaty Canadian Walleye. Potato pancakes are a rarity in Madison, but in their quest to offer a truly authentic Fish Fry Stalzys has put theirs on display. Unfortunately, for $32 they only provide four of the homemade cakes, and ours were gone in the blink of an eye (even without an absent side of apple sauce). In all honesty, Stalzys cakes were more like crepes than the gritty compressed shreds we have come to expect, but dont let the consistency fool you, the flavors were exquisite. They pan-fried delights were light and airy, and their faint oniony taste was simply delicious. While we wouldnt call them traditional they were yummy, with their only downfall being their scant numbers. For $32 Id expect this portion to at least be doubled. Four EACH, please...A family style bowl of tartar tagged along and was obviously homemade. The large bowl was filled with the semi-thick sauce which we hardly remember eating but was clearly adequate and moved the fish forward. The cup of sauce shared a plate a pile of slaw and two kinds of bread: one rye, and one rosemary. Both breads were fresh and chewy and played nicely with the peppy slaw. Like most things at the Atwood Ave. deli, the slaw was homemade and packed a wallop. It was thick, creamy, and had a noted zest. It paired well with the rye as their vigor played the Hyde to the smooth fishs Jekyll.All in all, this was a delicious Fish Fry, but I have to believe most (if not all) Fish Fry fans are going to balk at that price. In fact, when we conceptualized the system behind MFF.com we built it to handle your standard $10 Fish Fry, and never envisioned a Fish Fry of this magnitude - our system simply cant reconcile it. While we would probably recommend this Fish Fry at $16 a person we wouldnt necessarily highly recommend it (as our scores indicate) at that price. There is no doubt the food was great and we would feel okay recommending this Fish Fry as an occasional splurge, but at $32 it could never be an every Friday kind of thing. stalzysdeli.com/2701 Atwood AveMadison, WI 53704     (608) 249-7806",4088,0.18769698114936212,0.6103798758560663

While not well known, the legend of Melly is growing as her southern-fried specialties are quickly becoming the subject of local lore. From the deep-fried catfish and chicken wings to the homemade mac-n-cheese, Melly seems to do just about everything well and Madisons food lovers are starting to take notice.Provided you can find Melly in her basement confines you are in for a real treat. On Friday there are a few different fish on special, starting with the southern staple of catfish, which comes as a fillet or in nugget form. While the Catnuggets sounded interesting I wasnt brave enough to try them this go-round, nor did I opt for the ocean perch (which I tried last time) or the cod (which is apparently not popular at Mellys). We had a large party for a Friday and lunch it took a little longer than average for our food to trickle out of the kitchen. The first round arrived about 15 minutes after we ordered with subsequent plates coming every couple of minutes after that. Since I was first on the list, my deep fried catfish came right away, and while I wanted to wait for everyone to get their food it would have been crazy to do so. The catfish was steaming hot, and I almost burned my finger as I tore into it to release some of the heat and get a manageable bite. As youd expect, the meat was a little mushy (thats what you get from those bottom-feeders), but it was still tender and tasty. It had a lovely white color and a smoother flavor than the over-powering stank you get from the darker colored cuts of catfish. The batter was fried to a beautiful golden color and was subtly seasoned. Pairing elegantly with the fish was Mellys homemade tartar sauce. The thick mix was a force to be reckoned with, and boasted a boat-load of relish and a creamy mayo base. It really took the fish up a notch, but the small cup had me scraping bottom on the last couple bites. Melly lets you choose any two sides you want with your Fish Fry and I went for the standard fries and the not-so-standard mac-n-cheese. The thick-cut crinkle fries were plentiful and fried just right. They had a crisp snap to em and could well have been cut in-house, but then again, could well have not been. Regardless, its not like it even matters because they were delicious as was the homemade mac-n-cheese which was a great substitution for the basic coleslaw.  Rounding out the meal was a piece of white bread that sat under the fish, and sorta served as a grease trap. Luckily, Mellys fish isnt very greasy so there wasnt much that needed trapping. This left the bread dry for the most part, but a little limp from its time spent steaming under the catfish. Mellys is in an odd spot, and is solely a destination since there is no way youre going to just stumble upon their subterranean home. For those willing to take the underground plunge youll be rewarded with some really great food for a really good price. For those unwilling wimps, the myth of Mellys will just continue to grow larger and larger. Overall, I highly recommend this Fish Fry, and would say it is some of the best catfish youll find in these parts. www.facebook.com/pages/Melly-Mels-Deli-and-Catering/182956735083524313 W Beltline HwyMadison, WI 53713     (608) 270-9512",3407,0.12583858543417367,0.45041316526610653

I think you would be too if you were placed in the same situation - that being a dinner recommendation from a reputable source at a less than reputable establishment. The establishment in this case goes by the name Melly Mells and is located in unfortunate confines - a basement room in a block building on a Beltline frontage road in a need-to-know-it-to-find-it kind of place. After a little recognizance and reassurance I decided to give it a go, and figured Id see if Jer was up for it since he is nothing if not open minded.We found ourselves through the rabbit hole (or the sketchy looking door in this case), just before noon on a majestic Friday. We were a little hesitant to take the final steps down the stairs into Mellys subterranean home, but bravely forged ahead, thoughts of freshly fried fish in our minds. We made our way through the dark hall, eventually emerging at the surprisingly well-lit but windowless dining space. The dining space in this case was a small room, roughly 20x30 Id say, with a couple high-top tables, and a couple funky dining-style tables. Since no one else was around we had our pick of the litter. We chose a high-top, gazed at the menu for an instant, and then made our way to the counter to put in our orders with Mellys son who was very friendly and quite informative (not just about the food, but also the Maury Povich show which happened to be on not one, but two TVs in the tiny space).

At one point Melly also had cod on the menu, but it was apparently phased out due to lack of popularity which kinda threw me for a loop. Cod not popular? What is the world coming to? I resigned myself to the perch while Jer went catfish since this was a southern fried cookin kinda place. The food came about 15 minutes after we ordered and was clearly hand done just for us. The six perch fillets were coated in a light cornmeal breading which was probably the best weve had. It had a nice kick of spice, but was perfectly in balance with the fish. While the corny coating was bordering on being overly-thick for the perch it was nice and crispy which crushed any fishy taste. The same breading adorned the catfish and was the perfect thickness for the clean, surprisingly white fillet. Of the two, the catfish clearly stood out, and wed go that route if we were to return. Mama Mell knows how to fry that Cat!The list of sides was vast  everything from collard greens to spaghetti was represented and I was tempted by several of them. However, since I figured the fish would be unique enough, and I wanted our trip to Mellys to be as traditional as possible, I stuck to my guns, and went for the fries and coleslaw. The fries were thick-cut crinkles and came in a deceptively large portion. While they were well fried, they were fairly standard. Likewise, the slaw was fine, but had a unique taste that I couldnt quite put my finger on. While the consistency was good, and I ate every bit of it, I didnt really like it - weird, I know. Truthfully, I wish I would have just sucked it up and went for the Mac-n-Cheese (which Jer said was phenomenal), and the spaghetti (which is always awesome, I mean, cmon spaghetti?) I chose poorly.Rounding out the meal was some homemade tartar and a single square of white bread. The tartar was thick and yellowish, and almost had me thinking it was potato salad for a minute. It actually tasted pretty good and had quite a bit of relish, but didnt stand a chance next to the spicy breading on the fish. The bread square was also fine and appeared to be mildly toasted with a little butter and/or grease on top. Unbeknownst to us when we ordered, the catfish gets a bonus cornbread which looked good, but garnered no feedback from Jer.You know, if Melly Mells was in a cute little building on Lake or Francis they would make an absolute killing with their classic home cooking. As it stands, their basement confines are a huge detractor and even the promise of good food isnt enough to get some people in the door. Location aside, Melly Mells is a fine place with tasty homemade food - its that simple. Overall, we recommend both the perch and the catfish, but would be more apt to tell our friends and family to go there if it wasnt in such a dumpy spot. www.facebook.com/pages/Melly-Mels-Deli-and-Catering/182956735083524313 W Beltline HwyMadison, WI 53713     (608) 270-9512",4777,0.2078590785907858,0.5642010259388308

However, since I figured the fish would be unique enough, and I wanted our trip to Mellys to be as traditional as possible, I stuck to my guns, and went for the fries and coleslaw. The fries were thick-cut crinkles and came in a deceptively large portion. While they were well fried, they were fairly standard. Likewise, the slaw was fine, but had a unique taste that I couldnt quite put my finger on. While the consistency was good, and I ate every bit of it, I didnt really like it - weird, I know. Truthfully, I wish I would have just sucked it up and went for the Mac-n-Cheese (which Jer said was phenomenal), and the spaghetti (which is always awesome, I mean, cmon spaghetti?) I chose poorly.Rounding out the meal was some homemade tartar and a single square of white bread. The tartar was thick and yellowish, and almost had me thinking it was potato salad for a minute. It actually tasted pretty good and had quite a bit of relish, but didnt stand a chance next to the spicy breading on the fish. The bread square was also fine and appeared to be mildly toasted with a little butter and/or grease on top. Unbeknownst to us when we ordered, the catfish gets a bonus cornbread which looked good, but garnered no feedback from Jer.You know, if Melly Mells was in a cute little building on Lake or Francis they would make an absolute killing with their classic home cooking. As it stands, their basement confines are a huge detractor and even the promise of good food isnt enough to get some people in the door. Location aside, Melly Mells is a fine place with tasty homemade food - its that simple. Overall, we recommend both the perch and the catfish, but would be more apt to tell our friends and family to go there if it wasnt in such a dumpy spot. www.facebook.com/pages/Melly-Mels-Deli-and-Catering/182956735083524313 W Beltline HwyMadison, WI 53713     (608) 270-9512",4777,0.2078590785907858,0.5642010259388308

Regardless, they never seem to get it right. They always have fish-n-chips on the menu, and this Friday their special was Tilapia which tells you something right there. Since Tilapia isnt a traditional Fish Fry fish, and it doesnt fry very well in my opinion, I just stuck with the $13 haddock fish-n-chips. Previous experience with the daily haddock didnt give me the highest hopes and that trepidation was quickly realized. Two small pieces of fish make up the portion and are home to a beer batter that is actually really tasty. The batter did soften a little on the underside which made the cornmeal-based coating a less crispy, but the seasoning made it work - save for the moment when the fish slid right out of its home. This coating is definitely not a clinger. Lots of house-cut fries come with the fish, and while I love house-cut fries this batch was practically all nubs and slightly over-fried. If youre going to cut your fries in-house you have to use long potatoes and these clearly were not; sure, they tasted fine, but I needed to have the pinchers out the whole time to get at them. The tartar was good but not really memorable and no bread comes with the fish-n-chips (as you might expect). The slaw didnt look fresh nor did it taste crisp, but at least the flavor was there. While I basically knew what I was getting into by going to the Craftsman on a Friday it was no less disappointing when the food didnt deliver. Overall, we dont recommend this Fish Fry and will make sure the next Food Fight gift card gets used at Montys or maybe DLUX. www.craftsmantableandtap.com/6712 Frank Lloyd Wright AvenueMiddleton, WI 53562     (608) 836-3988",2213,0.09237155388471179,0.4376670843776107

The Fish Fry at the Craftsman Table & Tap is something we thought would evolve over time, but apparently they like what theyve got and theyre sticking with it. Fair enough.While what the CT&T has is good, there is room for improvement  at least in the Fish Fry department (or fish-n-chips department as it were). The Middleton Heights hotspot is always busy, and this Friday was no exception. Luckily, we were able to get a couple stools at the crowded bar, and figured wed just eat there since the wait for a table was lengthy. Our food came relatively quickly after we got our order in, and looked simply delicious when it arrived. The Fish (-n-chips) Fry consisted of two long pieces of haddock draped over a bevy of house-cut fries, and surrounded by some caper-crazy tartar and a bowl of slaw. Of course, there was no bread to be seen (damn you fish-n-chips!).We started in with the fish and it was initially pleased with it. It had a flaky texture, and was capped with a very light beer batter that had an adequate amount of seasoning. The first piece was almost flawless, but unfortunately part of the second piece got saturated with grease. Despite the soggy last couple bites the haddock was tasty in general, although the portion size left a little something to be desired. While the pieces were long, they were also thin, and didnt fill me up. It was what we would call a good start, but a third piece would certainly make for a much more satisfying finish. If there is one thing MFF loves, it is house-cut French fries. The Craftsman does the in-house duties, but while my plateful of sinewy spuds tasted fine, they werent scalding hot which detracted from their overall greatness. They were clearly well-fried at one point, but must have sat and waited for the fish which resulted in the thin strips being a limp and lifeless. Of course, every one of them got eaten anyway. The tartar was also a bit of a misstep, and was very flavorful, but not necessarily in a good way. It was loaded up with a ton of capers, and a noticeable amount of dill. While the overall taste sensation wasnt awful, Id honestly take a food service industry sauce over it any day. It kind of seemed like an unnecessary attempt to reinvent the wheel, and you know what they say about a good classic tartar  if it aint broke,why the hell are you trying to fix it? Probably the weirdest part about this Fish Fry was the coleslaw. It started off well with some fresh, finely-shredded cabbage, but from there took a turn for the worse. It was loaded up with an overpowering amount of white wine vinegar, and while we tend to like vinegar based slaws, they usually arent the white wine variety. At best it was unexciting, and really just tasted off altogether.  The lack of bread was a letdown, and one area where we really hoped the CT&T would have made a change. They didnt. This was what Id call a typical Food Fight Fish Fry. While we have come to expect good things from the food conglomerate they rarely transcend our expectations, and while we always leave satisfied we are rarely blown away. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry, but just kind of wish it was something more. www.craftsmantableandtap.com/6712 Frank Lloyd Wright AvenueMiddleton, WI 53562     (608) 836-3988",3363,0.18464676034348163,0.5126736924277908

When the new Food Fight incarnation took over its Middleton Hills home from the loathsome Byrds we were thrilled. Byrds was more or less just going through the motions and never fully committed to offering a unique, quality product, and we knew that kinda stuff wouldnt fly with the Food Fight crew. Needless to say, I had high hopes for their Friday Fish. When we arrived the venue was as we expected it would be  packed. The young, seemingly overwhelmed, hostess greeted us and with no hesitation quoted us a wait time of are you ready for this 80 minutes! 80! I know, right? Nuts. Im not sure if the grandiose estimate was a means to scare us off, or just the hostesses way of hedging her bets, but this aint MFFs first rodeo, and we could tell from the size of the place and the amount of people that that estimate was a little high. We got on the list, and immediately headed to the bar to grab some drinks - come what may. Our 80 minutes turned into a quick 30 and we had a table with a view in no time (the view was of Frank Lloyd Wright Avenue, but hey, beggars cant be choosers). When our waitress came by soon after we were ready for her since part of our time at the bar was spent studying the menu. It took 20 minutes or so for our fish to fry and the 2-piece haddocks came hot, but not scalding. We were immediately struck by the breading on the fish which appeared to be cornmeal-based, but a unique take on the southern-style. My first bite almost ended tragically as my slippery fish squirted out of its fried sheath. Luckily, I was able to grab it up quickly and salvage the ship. Thereafter I made sure to keep a firm grip on the slick fish and had little trouble for the duration. While the coating wasnt thin and flaky, its gritty texture housed a really nice flavor, and paired well with the smooth fish. The haddock itself was flaky, and bred a tiny bit of grease, which almost acted as a lubrication to enhance the meat. I thought it was very good, but Gabe simply loved it (although I think it was partially due to the fact that Gabe hasnt been taking in as many Fish Fry recently so his frame of reference is a little off). In any case, it was very good.Some homemade tavern fries came along in a large portion and were superb as well. The skin-on, thin-cut spuds harkened back to the Hubs Fries of our youth, although were not as legendary as the County Fair fries. Again, Gabe simply loved them while I thought they were very good, but lost some luster due to a few lukewarm individuals scattered throughout my pile.As is often the case, most newcomers to the Fish Fry game think they can put their own stamp on the tradition with a new take on tartar sauce- these attempts usually fail. Craft Table and Tap took this oft travelled path, and while their speckled sauce didnt veer as far from the trail as some, it did appear to have some non-traditional elements. The thin blend was also a bit heavier on the dill flavor than we care for. Some slack was picked up by a delectable Dijon-infused homemade slaw, but was quickly let out again by the absence of bread. No matter how tasty the creamy coleslaw, or how hearty the haddock, they just cant span the rye void, which I have to say, I was surprised to see at a place clearly trying to mark their mark in the Fish Fry universe. No bread? Not too crafty, fellas.Growing pains are to be expected, but we can easily say we already like the CT&T way more than its predocessor. I have to imagine, given another month or two, the place will be running like a well-oiled machine and their fish and fries will find some friends worthy of their stature. As it stands, even with the atypical tartar, bet-hedging hostesses, and absence of bread we still thought it was a fair deal. Overall, we feel comfortable recommending the fish we ate this time around, and sense that the best is yet to come as the Table & Tap continues to hone their craft. www.craftsmantableandtap.com/6712 Frank Lloyd Wright AvenueMiddleton, WI 53562     (608) 836-3988",4128,0.21244676494676495,0.5656462306462305

Eatin fish with friends is even better. Eatin fish with friends and supporting a noble cause like a community center is about as good as it gets. We got it good.The Ironworks Cafe in the Goodman Center has a reputation for serving scrumptious breakfasts, and when they recently put out word that they were wading into the Friday Fish Fry pool I took note. While their initial offering isnt cheap ($16), the fact that the food is high quality and the proceeds support the Center make the price you pay easier to swallow. As suggested by the flyer we decided to make a reservation, although as it turned out, it wasnt really necessary.Our party of 7 was to arrive for the second seating of the evening and when JJ and I showed up a little early we were surprised that we were the first to do so. The friendly hostess led us out of the Café and down the hall to a banquet room that was set up to handle larger parties. A high school aged server came by a minute or two later with some bread, and gleefully ran off to grab us a couple beers. We tore into the rolls with reckless abandon. The buns were hearty and tasty, and paired well with the Hopalicious our server returned with. Gabe and Bethany were the next to roll in, followed closely by Jer and Zach. More beers were brought and by 7:35 the whole crew was in attendance. Most everyone ordered the walleye special, although a couple of expensive veggie burgers joined the fun as well. Before the fish our waiter(s) brought the pickle tray which is The Ironworks take on the traditional relish tray offered at many-a supper club. While the dish featured a variety of tasty pickled items including: cherry tomatoes, green beans, carrots and jalapenos, it didnt feature any of the traditional elements like raw celery and radishes. Dont get me wrong, any type of tray is a welcome addition to a Fish Fry, but was atypical to say the least, and the portions were TINY  about one of each item per person. The fish came in due time - the walleye split into two large chunks. It featured a relatively thick beer batter, but since the fillet was so beefy it held its ground. This creamy coating had nice flavor, and could easily be eaten with or without the fish (from which it so readily fell off). The Canadian Walleye itself was high quality and it showed. It was smooth and flaky, and despite the thick casing had a great taste and minimal grease. Everyone agreed it was good, and a couple connoisseurs even commented that it was some of the best theyd ever had. High praise coming from those individuals Paddling out behind the walleye was a nice portion of home-cut French fries. The skin-on spuds were a little limp and not scalding hot, but were still well above average and desirable. While they could have been a hint crispier they were well salted which was enough for me.Clearly some love went into this Fish Fry as evidenced by the hand-battered fish and homespun fries. However, they really outdid themselves when it came time to talk tartar. While the standard Sysco will do for most places, the homemade aioli style tartar whipped up at by Ironworks put it to shame. The thick sauce was simply superb, with a rich taste and just a hint of dill. It easily stood its ground against the brute force of the beer batter, adding a zesty pop to each fishy bite.If we have to nitpick (and we do) there was one thing about this Fish Fry that just didnt click  the coleslaw. While it was clearly homemade, it had an odd flavor and was oddly chopped such that it was difficult to eat. Oh well, a bad slaw does not a Fish Fry ruin. While we expected good things from Goodman I wouldnt say we anticipated an offering as impressive as this. The fish, fries, and tartar were simply superb, and The Ironworks unique additions worked well. It is clear that some thought went into this Fish and Burger Nights concept and they are doing whatever they can to keep it authentic, but not dull. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry, and hope this wasnt a one-time thing.

Maybe you loved the youthful humor of Happy Gilmour as a teenager, but find that it misses your funny bone as an adult. Or perhaps you thought a certain young lady or gentleman looked pretty darn good in the dimly lit bar last night only to be surprised in the bright light of the morning. In any case, sometimes our opinion on things differs when we see them in a different setting, and sometimes the Fish Fry that is so great at lunch just doesnt have the same luster at dinner time. Weve reviewed the Koffee Kup on numerous occasions, but every time has been lunch-related. Weve raved about the quality and affordability, but probably had our blinders on somewhat and gave them a little more credit than they were due simply because we were glad they actually have fish for lunch since not all places do. This time we put them to the dinnertime test, and while it was still a nice little Fish Fry it didnt shine quite so bright. The Kup has cod, lake perch, and walleye on Friday and this time we tried the $8.50 lake perch. Contrary to our previous forays into the freshwater variety this version featured three inordinately large fillets which caused doubt as to whether or not this was the true Yellow Perch we expected. The flavor of the fish added to this uncertainty as it was very bland and not aided by a light breading which lacked seasoning. Ultimately it begged for the tartar which, thankfully, delivered. The tartar comes in a big squeeze bottle so there is no danger of running out which allows generous slathering of the thick, creamy concoction. The zip it provided was necessary with the mellow fish making it more than palatable. As a place that specializes in breakfast youd expect hash brown mastery here, and the KK definitely delivers. Their version of the staple is well-fried, appropriately sized, and features the ideal proportion of onion and American cheese. They are melty, gooey spud mastery. A dense, spherical roll rolls along with the fish as begs for butter. Some homemade slaw also keeps pace and puts out a slightly better-than-average taste - not totally bland, but not a ton of pop either. While all these things add up to a super little lunch, they dont really seem all that great for supper, even if its still only $8.50. Its every bit of inoffensive just not extraordinary.

Whether its an undrafted rookie making an NFL roster and becoming a Pro Bowler or a fabulous milkshake at the local truck stop, big things can turn up in the most unexpected of places... and of course, Friday Fish Fry is no stranger to this phenomenon. Fish Fry is wonderful for this exact reason. While the best are usually found in our states supper clubs, even the local diner has the ability to stand out as long as they put in a little effort. The effort in this case comes in the form of hand-batter fish, house-cut fries, homemade tartar sauce and coleslaw, and some sort of bread (preferably rye). The Koffee Kup in downtown Stoughton in one place that unexpectedly gives it its all. The Kup has a few different options on Friday, a couple of which you might not anticipate. While you might assume there would be cod (and youd be right), you might not plan on there being more (better) options. Beyond the $8.50 cod, there is an identically priced lake perch as well as a $10 WALL-I (which is what I availed myself of this time around). The fish came fast and was the full meal deal. It consisted of a single, long walleye fillet with a breading that looked like it belonged to some fried chicken. The fish itself was meaty and had a really pleasant flavor that overshadowed the breading (which could have used some more salt). It sure was a lot of meat for ten measly bucks. Since the KK is a family restaurant/diner kind of place you expect the potato options to be top notch, and Stoughton spot certainly delivers. There are plenty of options to choose from, but for me the hash browns with cheese and onion sounded too good to pass up. While the C&O were $0.90 extra, they were worth every cent as they made the shredded spuds extra enticing. They sported crispy edges, supple centers, plenty of onion, and two slices of American cheese. Whats more, they barely carried any grease with them which lets you know the cooks really have their act together. When theres a big piece of fish on the plate a big helping of tartar is your best friend, and the Koffee Kup doesnt disappoint. They simply provide a whole squeeze bottle of thick and creamy sauce and let you have at it. Its just what the doctor ordered and gives the fish a swift kick in tail. A little warm roll rode on top of the hash browns and was more than just your regular yeasty dinner roll.  The homemade slaw was also above average and had a plenty of zip, although it was a little watery at the end. A little effort and knowhow goes a long way when youre taking Friday Fish Fry and sometimes those things show up in the most astonishing places. While the Koffee Kup isnt the prototypical pike place, theyll definitely surprise you with what they can do. Overall, we highly recommend the WALL-I at the Koffee Kup, and are really coming to expect great things in Stoughton. 355 E.

I pay attention. I ask around. I know about all the places there are to know about. How could one of the best Fish Fry deals in Dane County eluded me? It just wasnt possible (or so I thought). Then I got a tip  I investigated  I stumbled upon a juicy little secret  clearly something the folks in Stoughton are trying to keep under wraps. Something they want to keep all to themselvesThe Koffee Kup is Stoughtons Anne Frank, quietly tucked away in the shadow of City Hall, buried in a narrow slit of a building that the locals know well, but out-of-towners whiz right by. Within these walls you will find neighborly camaraderie, bottomless cups of coffee, and what we came for  the Friday Fish Du Jour. I arrived right at noon, took one of the few open stools at the counter, and had my order in within five minutes.The KK gives a choice between cod, lake perch, and walleye, of which I settled on the $8 lake perch with a side of hash browns (cheese & onion - $0.80 extra). I had the fish in front of me no more than five minutes later, which, of course, meant it had no time to sit and get greasy. Five average-sized perch made the pilgrimage and were flaky and moist - very perchy. The small fillets housed a light, golden-yellow breading which reminded us of the kind used at Dexters. In fact, had I been blindfolded you could have easily fooled me into thinking they were one in the same. Like Dexters delicious rendition, these guppies could have used a hint more salt to bolster the smooth fish, but, all things considered, were excellent. Now, the KK is basically a hometown diner  the kind of place that takes breakfast very seriously. As such, youd expect that they would know what they are doing around a side of hash browns (and youd be right). My spud selection was a sage one, featuring a large pile of shreds covered with two slabs of American Cheese and a lavish amount of onion. They were fried to absolute perfection, with the flavors that resulted being more than the sum of some of the parts which went in. Truly superb. Though the fish needed nary a drop, an entire bottle of tartar was provided with it. The tartar was tasty, composed solely of mayo and a proper amount of relish.  The mix was semi-sweet and didnt have a ton of zip, but worked in concert with perch to produce a lovely harmony. A pillow-soft dinner roll proved to us that the Koffee Kup takes their lunchhour Fish Fry seriously, with this point being further emphasized by their homemade coleslaw. A base of fresh cabbage was punctuated with ample carrot, and blended with a unique sauce to produce a slaw that was not off-putting, but not quite as zesty as we like. At this point, I think its safe to say that our suspicions are confirmed. Yes, you heard it here, folks: The Koffee Kup in Stoughton has a great Fish Fry, and you owe it to yourself to check it out. Locals, you can consider your little secret exposed - your cover busted  your Fish Fry outted.

And we figure, since were eating the fish anyway we might as well do a proper review  you know, just to see how things stack up across the state We happened to be in the La Crosse area and since weve had Houghtons Fine Food-Cocktails on our list for what seems like forever we figured we should finally check them off. To be fair, we arrived at Houghtons kinda late (8:30 to be exact). Whats more, we were a little rundown from a rousing game of hockey over in La Crescent, but still in the mood for fish (too bad no one else seemed to be). The place was practically empty save for a smattering a stragglers in the bar and dining room. Needless to say, we had no trouble acquiring a table and ordering up the Friday special. The $10 2-piece cod comes fully loaded, and we got after it immediately. Houghtons salad bar was a little depleted by this point in the evening, but was still fairly fresh. It featured the supper club standard iceberg lettuce, basic dressings, a few bound salads, dinner rolls, a couple soups, and (luckily) some pickled herring. While we didnt try the soup, we perused the rest of the selection, with the coleslaw being creamy, but runny, the potato salad being what youd expect, and the dinner roll hovering around the mean. Reinhart? Sysco? I wouldnt be surprised at allOur freshly fried fish showed up about 15 minutes after it was ordered and was nice and hot. While there were only two pieces present, what they lacked in quantity they more than made up for in girth. These were not your average cuts of cod. Each of the pristine white and flaky fillets had to be pushing 6oz., very little of which was batter. The coating, in his case, was a light beer batter with a pleasant flavor that complemented the fish rather than overwhelming it. While a little grease was in the neighborhood it didnt soak the batter, or ruin the high quality fish.With limited potato options (baked, twice-baked or French fries) we settled on the fries which were very blah. Sure, there were plenty of them, but the Julienne-cut Janes were nothing to write home about. We also got a glimpse of the twice-baked which was more like some sort of whipped/mashed dealie than the traditional twice-baked potato youd expect. No one at the table was impressed. If anything about the meal was memorable it was Houghtons take on the tartar, but while the sauce stuck in our minds, it also stuck in our craw. This stuff was unique, to say the least. Simply put, it had lots of weird little speckles and an unknown flavor or two that were interesting but not traditional by any stretch. It tasted fine, and had an acceptable consistency so well let the oddities slide, but were still a bit put off by the whole thing. The more Fish Frys we eat outside the Madison area the more we realize how good we actually have it around these parts. While Houghtons wasnt bad, it was a bit of a letdown considering wed heard it was one of the best in the La Crosse area. Overall, we still feel fine about recommending this Fish Fry, the cod was great, and it was a complete meal, but it didnt quite live up to the expectations wed placed on it. Maybe thats our fault? Or maybe, just maybe, were actually spoiled Madison? Wed tend to lean towards the latter.1002 Jackson StLa Crosse, WI 54601     (608) 784-9770",3483,0.14205215804096402,0.5297932954276237

Sometimes second guessing myself pays off...most of the time it doesn't...Prairie Lanes has a few different levels of fish including a 6-piece ""nuggets"" (which sounded like Mrs Paul's pre-battered junk), so I went for the full-on AYCE since I didn't have much to eat earlier in the day. Before the fish, diners are treated to a full-fledged salad bar which was loaded with the finest Sysco has to offer. In all honesty, this Sysco-bar was probably the highlight of the meal. It featured some clam-less chowder (that had the right thickness but the wrong amount of clam), and salad ingredients that were as standard as they come, but at least there for the taking. The fish came about 10 minutes after we'd had out fill of iceberg lettuce and cream of ""_____"" and looked uninspired to say the least. The first round came with a duo of cod and a smattering of fries. The first inspection had me worried since it looked like the cod would be greasy, but by some miracle of science it actually wasn't. The problem here was not the grease, but the taste. It basically just tasted of the oil it was fried in which, as you can probably guess, wasn't great. Sure, there was lots of fish to eat (I did get two more pieces on the second round), but when it's basically tasteless how much do you want to eat? The four I did have were mostly just to fill up - which any good Wisconsonite in my position would do...DON'T JUDGE ME!!! Unlike the fish, the fries aren't AYCE and the round we got were lukewarm at best. Our kid's portion were scalding hot so you can try to figure that out what happened there. Our handful was also woefully small which had us distracting Junior and picking away at his when he looked the other way. The tartar comes in a big squeeze bottle and welcomes you to the table with a - ""Hey, I'm lukewarm, but probably okay to eat"" attitude. It was surprisingly palatable and since the cod begged for it plenty got used. It was thick and creamy and very very necessary. A split-top football roll was filled things out and was decent, but little else. In all honesty no bread could salvage this one, but this stinker did all it could. Sometimes things change and my reviews get outdated, but in this case what I had down on paper was spot on. This was not a great Fish Fry, but the strangest part wasn't even the Sysco salad or the puny portion of fries. The strangest part was that we had to wait a good 15-20 minutes for a table despite there being like 5 open. Unfortunately, those 5 were set for parties of 6 or more (of which there were none) so anyone with 3 or less was stuck waiting. It was an odd arrangement to say the least and just left us scratching our heads. Overall, we wouldn't have recommended this Fish Fry regardless and will have to trust our own review next time. prairielanes.com430 Clarmar DriveSun Prairie, WI 53590     (608) 837-2586",3014,0.060927128427128455,0.4847907647907649

It was packed. Surely, I thought, THIS was Sun Prairies original Fish Fry hot spot. Finally, after all the trials and tribulations we had found it. We scurried inside with our hopes high since busy Fish Frys usually equate to good Fish Frys. Well, our assumption wasnt 100% wrong, but it turned out many (if not most) of those present were actually here to bowl rather than to eat fish. Drat. To be fair, there were still a lot of Fish Fryers, but their numbers were clearly dwarfed by the amount of bowlers. Even with the 10-15 minute wait sign outside the door, we had no problem getting a table, although from that point on things slowed down waaaaaay down. It took about 10 minutes for our waitress to finally come by and when she did a whole lot of the $11 AYCE cod was ordered.The All You Can Eat comes with a trip to the salad bar, and we wasted no time getting to it. The spread was surprisingly good  full of fresh veggies and three soups. The veggies were average, as was the clam chowder. An ultra-gooey coleslaw came along for the ride as did some delicious cottage cheese. We wolfed down the soups and salads, but couldnt help but feel put off by the lack of drinks, which came only after the greens were gone. Not cool. The first round of fish came about 20 minutes after we ordered and wasnt totally hot. Uh oh Whats more, it was slightly over-fried to the point where the batter was bubbling off and tough in sections. While the thicker parts of the fish avoided this over-fried fate they werent helped by the rugged batter which didnt have much flavor and was too firm. While the first round was so-so we figured it was AYCE and better results could be expected on round two. However, it was not meant to be as the sequel was even crispier, even drier (which was hard to believe), and basically inedible. We didnt dare try a third round at this point, deciding to cut our losses with the funky fish. Certain places claim to offer potato pancakes because they think it makes their Fish Fry more authentic. For those not in the know, PPs are not the easiest thing to make and basically require a dedicated hand in the kitchen. Knowing the level of labor involved you could say I was suspicious when I saw PLs claiming to offer the traditional treat with their AYCE. I asked. She (our waitress) claimed they were real, and quite good. I was still suspicious, but pulled the trigger anyway. In PLs case the PPs were the little hash brown patties (as I suspected), but as she claimed, were actually decent tasting. So, while they werent the real deal per se, they at least tasted fine. The tartar was good, by all accounts, and the big squeeze bottle was nearing its end by the time we finished up. The blend was standard and at least took over where the fish left off. A nice small dinner bun, with a crusty outside and soft inside rounded out the meal. It was likely on the salad bar, although at this point I honestly dont remember if it was there or came with the fish  our notes said it was good which is really all that matters.A packed parking lot does not a Fish Fry make, and you could say that we got fooled by this one. I have to admit it was a strange since we went in with low expectations, had them raised by how busy the place was, and then had them crushed by so-so fish. Overall, we cant recommend this Fish Fry based on this experience and probably wont be going back any time soon.prairielanes.com430 Clarmar DriveSun Prairie, WI 53590     (608) 837-2586",3575,0.1154164021164021,0.45900423280423286

Reputations can only take you so far however.Fast forward to 2013, and a new era for Crandalls. The Middleton Drive-Thru location is no more. The owners have closed up shop and moved the business back downtown where their Fish Fry once thrived.

We showed up around 6:30pm, and decided to sit on the patio since Crandalls new State Street location allows for that. There are a couple different options on the Friday menu and it starts with the cod. The cod is served every day (as you might expect), but only costs $12 on Friday, as opposed to $13.50 the rest of the week. On Friday they also add an ocean perch option to the mix, and we had a plate of each in front of us in no time flat. One of the first things we noticed was how pretty our plates were. They had a wavy, almost flag-like, appearance which nicely framed the fish, and was certainly much more appealing than the Styrofoam takeout containers of yesteryear. The cod was perfectly fried to a rich golden-brown color and placed lovingly on the far left of the streamer. While the cod looked the part, the three non-descript pieces were just okay, and far from exceptional. The fish was home to a light, flaky breading that didnt have much flavor of its own. Thus, that duty fell to the fish, and while it was pure, it was still just cod which is more of a canvass for a flavorful batter than masterpiece on its own. The ocean perch was similar for the most part, and while completely inoffensive, didnt have much to hang its hat on besides its inherent OP essence. The far right side of the plate was occupied by a by a small pile of house-cut fries, which, unlike the fish, were a little under-fried. The al dente spuds still slid down, and were a cut above freezer fries, but left a little something to be desired. Another couple seconds in the fryer would certainly have done them justice. When fish is just kind of basic (like this fish was) it necessitates a tartar sauce with some real punch, and thankfully Crandalls delivered. Their homemade sauce was thick, rich, and creamy, and pert near perfect. While it was mostly mayo, there was enough relish present to let you know it was actually tartar. The finely-chopped slaw was also great, and had just the right amount of zip. Usually youd like to see it paired up with a piece of rye, or even a dinner roll, but apparently Crandalls doesnt carry bread outside of the Ciabatta used on their sandwiches so none came with the fish. For shame. While this wasnt the return to greatness wed hoped for from Crandalls it was still a very solid Fish Fry and a welcome addition to the ever-expanding downtown Fish Fry scene. Whats more, the Peruvian cuisine was reportedly outstanding, giving us yet another solid option on our vegetarian-friendly Fridays.

Actually, maybe remiss isnt the right term perhaps, total losers, a bunch of chumps, or hardcore slackers, would more adequately capture how bad it would indeed be if we did miss out on the Lenten tradition. I mean, how could we call ourselves Fish Fry fans? We really couldntAs far as we know St. Maria Goletti is the new kid on the block when it comes to Fish Frys, and with growing comes pains. Thats not to say that this Fish Fry was a pain, to the contrary it was quite enjoyable, but there were some kinks that made the journey less than smooth.Luckily for us I had the foresight to arrive early, and early we were. At 5pm the line was short and we were able to quickly grab a drink at the makeshift bar, and scurry right to the front of it. We had a table after a brief wait and joined a group of six strangers whose meals were already in progress *kink*We slipped in quietly, and eventually one of the waitresses (Pat) came over and took our orders. It was kind of a kludge ordering system *kink* but we basically had choice of baked or fried cod, and baked or fried potato. She wrote them down on a huge notecard and ambled towards the kitchen to deliver them. Luckily for the folks at SMG we were here for fried fish because they were already behind on baked and really couldnt handle any more orders for it. *kink* That fact alone basically sealed their fate for the evening behind on AYCE baked fish at 5 = unable to ever catch up. No sooner had our orders went in than our dining companions diners showed up. While we dined on dinner rolls (hamburger buns) *kink* and poorly congealed clam chowder *kink* they dug in to the main course. At least we had something to gnash on, and the beer was fairly cheap, so all was not lost. As I rose to go grab us another round of the celestial suds I couldnt help but notice the line that we so readily moved to the front of now appeared stagnant and lead far out through the double doors into the church hallway. These people would not be eating for some time especially if they wanted baked fish. Arriving early is next to godliness.Around the time our fellow diners were a piece or two in our own platters showed up. The first three pieces of cod were fried to a crisp, and hot, but not scalding. *kink* While the fish was slightly over-fried in areas, it was still flaky and moist for the most part. It had a dark batter which was actually quite flavorful and somewhat surprisingly so as I half expected that burned in the fryer flavor. Before we finished we managed to hail down Pat for round two  receiving two more pieces about 5 minutes later. This round was similar, but a little crispier and a little less moist even. *kink*As you might expect, the French fries were the standard Julienne-cut freezer to fryer ones they serve with the kids school lunches. The baked potatoes were also standard, and were reported by some of our fellow diners to be undercooked.*kink*The good Lord loves his mayo so you know his followers are going to do everything they can to please him with their tartar and coleslaw offerings. The SMG sauce was thick and relishy, without being overbearing. It shed its light on all it touched handling the singed fish with grace. The creamy coleslaw boasted some red cabbage and other colorful items, but while it pleased the eye the palate was indifferent.When all was said and done with the fish we helped ourselves to some homemade desserts since we were close to the serving table and the kids pushing the carts around seemed unreliable. The apple pie I chose was great, although it looked like you couldnt go wrong with any of the cookies or cakes (some store bought, some homemade).There really was a lot to like about this Fish Fry: the volunteer wait staff was great, the dining room was beautiful, the company was friendly, and the meal was thorough. Unfortunately, there were a few too many kinks for us to fall in love with it. Overall, we still feel okay about recommending this Fish Fry based on this visit, but  St. Petes well-oiled machine it was not. stmariagoretti.org/SMG/Parish/FishFrySignup.aspx5313 Flad AvenueMadison, WI 53711     (608) 271-7421",4251,0.10010929877001304,0.46626490242561663

It has fish - About five tiny pieces of lightly breaded cod scattered throughout each piece. It has fries - Some crinkle-cut fries, only a few, but they added substance and taste of actual French fries when eaten separately. It has tartar sauce  Although its not all that noticeable reallyIt has bread  Probably the best part of this Fish Fry is Ians pizza crust which is great, but we think a rye rendition might make more sense.It has coleslaw  Probably the most noticeable ingredient. Slathered across the top adding a little bit of zest. While it may not sound the best, the overall flavor combination is good - certainly not gross as some have hypothesized. The true taste of a Fish Fry only came through on the bites with fish, but even the cheese dominated bites were not without their charm. In much the same way Ians mac-n-cheese pizza tastes like mac-n-cheese, but youd still probably rather have a real bowl of mac-n-cheese; the Fish Fry pizza is good, but youd still much rather have the real thing. Regardless, it is a nice surrogate on a non-Friday, and was a fun experiment.

We showed up, had some drinks, ate some fish (it was good), and that was that. End of story.For $9 the Lazy Oaf Fish Fry features two large pieces of cod, nice potato options, some homemade slaw, and a side of tartar. The cod was the star of the show, featuring a flaky texture and delicate batter. The pieces were larger than average, but the surprisingly thin Lake Louie beer batter had no problem standing up to their might. While, as with most beer batters, a little bit of grease developed, it wasnt near enough to ruin the fish or even slightly degrade it. French fries, cheesy potato casserole, and potato pancakes made for a tough decision, but as we normally do, settled on the PPs since they were available. The lone soldier that showed was really tasty, but it was just him, no platoon, no backup. Never have I seen only one cake considered a portion, so that was a letdown, but it was larger than normal, and had a great consistency, so Ill still chalk it up as a win. While it could have used a hint more onion it was still really good, as was the cheesy casserole which I also got a forkful of.A thick and creamy tartar offset the beefy cod just right. It was mostly mayo, but had enough relish to make it interesting. The slaw was also fascinating although not in a good way. The coarsely cut cabbage concoction was light on the mayo and heavy on the stank. It didnt sit well with anyone at the table, but at least didnt totally queer the deal. There was no bread served, and our waitresses seemed to be in La La Land (thoughts of baby on the brain, no doubt), but even that wasnt enough to ruin the meal. The fish, potatoes, and tartar were all very good, which in the long run is really all that matters.

Slapdash. Piecemeal. These are the things that come to mind when we think about the Fish Fry at The Fountain. We even showed up early, but to our dismay it didnt matter much  The Fountain was already falling behind. Several things on the menu werent available, and we lucked into the second to last order of cheese curds. Seriously, the second to last order of curds at 6:00 on a Friday night (you can bet there were some POd patrons after us). It took a while for the curds to get to our table (the waitress was frazzled from the get-go) but when they did come they were rich and delicious although accompanied by a bevy of batter crumbles. Surprisingly, or maybe not, the fish took a while to swim our way. The $11 2-piece took about 20 minutes to fry and was adequately hot when it showed its fins. The fish was super flaky, but the batter was so light that it couldnt contain it, and it flaked apart in the tartar. It was also greasy and a bunch of errant oil literally oozed from the second piece until I got it flipped over. While the batter had some seasoning it was slight and didnt give the fish much of a lift at all. Also, there were only two pieces which isnt much for eleven bucks.Accompanying the cod was a side of what The Fountain calls hash browns. This rendition on the shredded spuds was more of a cheesy casserole than real hash browns and was incredibly goopy. By default it doesnt come with onion in it, but they somehow worked them in for me. On the plus side, the potatoes were clearly shredded in house, and loaded with real cheddar, but they were just kinda odd, even with the requested onion. A tremendous amount of tartar came along for the ride, but the quantity was the only thing tremendous about it. While it was zesty, and didnt hurt the fish, it didnt make it better either. It was kind of creamy, but had more dill than relish, and didnt improve the fish one iota. Some serviceable slaw was clearly fresh, but didnt have a lot to hang its hat on. It was semi-creamy, but super boring, and left me wishing there was some bread to pair with it, which, of course, there wasnt. Boo. Scattered. Slapdash. Piecemeal. While this dinner at The Fountain wasnt awful, the whole thing just kind of seemed thrown together. Overall, we dont recommend this Fish Fry since there was no cohesion, and although there is potential here, the execution was lacking. www.thefountainofmadison.com122 State StreetMadison, WI 53703     (608) 250-1998",2489,0.14399224806201547,0.5217054263565891

The last time I checked the nearest body of salt water was a good days walk from Madison (if not further) which makes the fish that dwell in those waters anything but local. Even the once local lake perch, bluegill, and walleye are no longer harvest in these parts, with most coming from fisheries much further north. Thus if Fish Fry is your thing, but you only eat local, you are going to have a problem. Enter a paradox at The Fountain.The Fountain is into the whole hyper-fresh, hyper-local thing that plays so well in Madison, which is cool and all, but as we mentioned, does not jive eating Fish Fry  especially if you like cod or haddock. So how is a place like The Fountain to keep up with the Wisconsin tradition of Friday Fish Fry when the main ingredient in the meal doesnt jive with their philosophy? They do what any other place would do; they compromise to appease the Friday Fish crowd. Wise move. It turns out, not all the fisheries in the world are overfished and one of those in fine shape is the Pacific Cod. While were not sure if the The Fountains cod comes from these waters or not, wed suspect it does based on this fact (the Atlantic Cod is on the Do Not Eat list). So, while it may not be a local fish, it is at least a more environmentally friendly option. The presumed-Pacific cod is available in a 2 or 3 piece for $10 or $12, respectively; and when we showed up to try it we were delighted to be seated immediately. For being 7:30 on a Friday The Fountain wasnt nearly as busy as we thought it would be especially since downtown was jumpin. The waitress came over right away to take our orders and no more than 5 minutes later our fish was ready  a good start. As you might have guessed, the cod was screaming hot since the five minute wait didnt give it a chance to sit. The three hearty pieces were very good, featuring thick and flaky hunks of pristine meat. The smooth fish was complimented by a semi-thick beer batter which had a lot of flavor including something spicy that I couldnt quite put my finger on Cayenne? White pepper? No doubt, one of the two played a roll, but we may never know exactly which oneRegardless, the fish was good and all got eaten.There are no options for sides with The Fountain Fish Fry, but thats alright since none are needed. The cheezy hash browns that are offered are a good choice and while wed say they were more cheezy than hashbrowny, they were still tasty. According to Jer their delicate flavor was the product of Cream of Mushroom and/or onion soup mix, but that is neither here nor there in my book, Ill just call them yummy and leave him to nitpick the nuances.Rounding out the trio of tastiness was The Fountains homemade tartar which was smooth, zippy, and held up to the creamy cod despite its thinner than average consistency. Of all things, I was sure that there was no way theyd skimp on bread since they were doing everything in their power to keep their Fish Fry traditional. Well, I was wrong, and none came with the meal which left the coleslaw to fend for itself. Luckily, the slaw was supreme. It was creamy, and zesty - simply delicious. Gabe, Jer, and I all liked it which is really saying something cause Gabe normally dont do no slaw. This has to be some of the best slaw weve ever had, and I would gladly eat it with every Fish Fry. Nicely done, gents!There is a lot to like about the Fish Fry at The Fountain - lack of bread aside. The food was really good, and the service was quick and friendly. If there is any downside to meal (other than no bread) it would have to be the dreadful location The Fountain occupies. It is basically the old Tiki Shack space which is saddled with a dated design and split in half by a long hallway that connects State Street to Dayton Street. It is a kludge setup and makes patrons on their maiden voyage wonder what the hell is going on, and where exactly they should go (the correct answer is: an immediate left if you enter from Dayton, or all the way down and on the right  if you come from State. All geographic qualms aside, we recommend the Fish Fry at The Fountain as the quality of the food and the attention to detail in its preparation was evident. www.thefountainofmadison.com122 State StreetMadison, WI 53703     (608) 250-1998",4415,0.1976648781578359,0.4946210596914823

I mean, dont get me wrong, a Fish Fry buffet is better than no Fish Fry at all, but for our money, the finest in Fryland comes fresh from the kitchen and made to order  thats just the way it is. In fact, at times, weve been known to pass on all you can eat buffets in favor of a finite amount of freshly fried pieces  that should tell you just how strongly we feel about our fresh fried philosophy.The Fish Fry at St. Michael Catholic Parish in the Village of Dane is a seasonal affair, and before a few weeks ago we hadnt even heard of it. As you might have guessed from the intro, it is a buffet-style Fish Fry which costs 11 bucks but comes with all the fixins. Our 10 minute wait breezed by thanks to $2 Miller Lites (the beer selection was not great), and the delightful ambiance of the school hallway  kids artwork, motivational slogans galore - the whole nine yards.Well, we must have looked like a group of ruffians since the seating coordinator decided we needed to be WAAAAY down at the end of the cafeteria-style tables, well away from the next closet group of diners. We didnt really care and the second she turned away to seat the next group we headed to the buffet. The line started with a bang on some bonus baked beans (BBs arent a Fish Fry staple so you gotta be thankful when they come your way). The additional legumes were followed by a warming tray full of fritters, a tray of baked potatoes, the fries, and finally the fish. The coleslaw and regular rolls were already on the table, so as soon as the fish was on the plate we were on our way.Since the plates were smallish everything kinda ran together, but thats not really a problem for us here at MFF (although we know that for some people that would be a major issue)  plan accordingly. We sampled our fare in the same order it was on the buffet starting at the beans and going from there. You might assume that since its the school cafeteria theyd just serve you the same beans they serve the kids on a day-to-day basis, and youd be right. They were a nice addition, but certainly not something St. Mikes went out of their way on. Likewise, the fritters were also a bit on the south side of average. Regardless of how warm the tray seemed to be, the fried dough was lukewarm at best, and clearly not fresh. Whats more, there was nothing sweet (like honey) to perk up the crusty nuggets of dough which sat in my gut more like a rock than a pillow-y lump of sweetness. The hamburger buns that filled in as dinner rolls didnt do much to pick up the slack either, leaving us with a couple of bread options, but not one good one. Like the crusty fritters, the crinkle-cut fries were lukewarm at best, and simply not good. When it comes to French fries, warming trays be damned; if it isnt fresh from the fryer it is not going to be good (you might be catching on to why we arent big fans of buffets at this point- when youre talking fried, if youre not talking fresh, youre talking failure). Unlike the potatoes, which many All You Can Eaters pass right on by, the fish was hot on our first trip, and even hotter on round two. St. Michaels cod has a light cornmeal (catfish-style) breading which well could have been Shorelunch or some other non-descript mix. The key with the buffet system is to grab the good fat pieces, rather than the few thin ones that get mixed in. The fatties were flaky and moderately light with literally no grease at all while the thin pieces had a tendency to get firm and chewy. The second round fish (which was the hotter of the two) was far superior, again showing the freshness counts! Make sure to find the thick pieces that are steaming if you can. The tartar at the table came in a big family-style dish and looked to be homemade, but was thin and runny - more like ranch than mayo. It really wasnt very good, and didnt help the fish one iota. The coleslaw, which also awaited our arrival, was also possibly homemade, and also not so great. The thin vinegar blend tasted like they had mixed it the minute prior, leaving the marinade no time to soak into the raw tasting cabbage. The welcome reprieve at these sorts of events is supposed to be the homemade dessert table, but unfortunately for yours truly, some devilish doer spiked my plain looking cupcake with a dose of cinnamon not fit for Lucifer himself. Even a coffee cup full of milk wasnt enough to sooth the sting of the cinnamon, and after so many letdowns all we wanted to do was get out the basketball hoop in the corner and throw down some 8 dunks to vent our frustrations alas, it was no meant to be. What can we say about our visit to the church in Dane? Well, St. Petes it was not  I think weve established that. Maybe we have too lofty a standard based on the angelic offering in Aston? Probably, and I hate to knock a Church, but I can honestly say I wouldnt drive back out to Dane for this Fish Fry and wouldnt recommend anyone else do it either. Its really too bad, but it just wasnt good enough and if youre in Dane anyway you might as well just go to Peg & Docs  they make fish every week and know what they are doing.

Locals usually have the inside scoop - especially when it comes to their hometown Fish Frys. A few weeks back we stopped for a brew or two at Mojos in Waunakee, and while sitting there had a nice talk with local boy about the Fish Fry scene in Waunakee. While we all agreed that for a town of its size The Kee had disproportionately few Fish Frys, he claimed there were a couple we had not yet visited that were worth the trip. When you hear it from a local you know (at least you think you do).The American Legion in Waunakee hosts their Fish Fry on the second Friday of every month, and we just so happened to catch it during a fundraiser to support the hometown talent baseball team. The Legion is located right on the main drag, although its kind of hidden amongst the foliage so make sure you know where you are going ahead of time. If youre like us, youll want to start downstairs in the bar where the $1 eight ounce tappers quench your thirst while the fiercely pro-America décor fills your soul. Get a couple beers in ya, then head for the stairs where youll find a couple gents collecting for fish, a purple heart on display, and short wait to get into the dining room.Entrance into the upstairs banquet hall costs ten bucks and allows you one trip through the buffet line (if you want more you have to ask someone in the cleanup crew to get it for you unless there is no line  an awkward system for sure). We paid our dues, and briefly stood in the short line as it chugged along towards the food. As we exited the buffet, our plates overflowing with fish, we looked about the cafeteria to find an area large enough to accommodate our party of eight  we eventually lucked out and found a cluster of seats amidst the masses. Since we all know how finicky Fish Fry can be I wasted no time digging in as the fish wasnt getting any fresher (and didnt start that way to begin with  can you say steam tray?). The typical rectangular chunks were okay, but certainly not scalding hot which caused them to get a little firm. They featured a light, cornmeal-style breading that had little-to-no flavor to speak of. A couple of the meatier pieces were hotter and flakier, but overall, the fish was a disappointment. The thick-cut crinkle fries were also not freshly fried and merely okay. Of course, one positive is that with it being AYCE I could take as many as I wanted, and since I knew from the start itd be hard to get more I took my share and then some. Awaiting our arrival at the table was a suspiciously-full looking bowl of tartar sauce. It appeared the sauce hadnt been touched and when I took a dollop I could see why. Not only did it look unappetizing, but it had a bit too much dill and a funky texture. Perhaps Im overthinking it and the bowl was just freshly replenished, but it seemed to me that people were avoiding it like the plague not a good sign.Of all things, the coleslaw and the rolls were actually really good. The slaw was fresh and some vinegar added a subtle sweetness to the finely chopped mix that made it very appealing. Likewise, the buns were fresh, and gave a much needed distraction. As you might expect, the atmosphere at this Fish Fry was great, and the folks working were all friendly and helpful. It was a big family-style affair, with people laughing and joking with neighbor and stranger alike over cheap beer and ample fish  its just too bad the fish wasnt a little better and the system a little smoother. Overall, we just cant quite recommend this Fish Fry even if we would really like to. Sorry Vets, we appreciate your service, but not your fish.www.facebook.com/pages/American-Legion-Post-360/118241684859758417 East Main StreetWaunakee, WI 53597     (608) 849-4321",3774,0.07756318436465495,0.445168332484509

The Z-mans Fish Fry was a poor representation at best, and was actually bad enough to make us fear the fish at their replacement restaurant. It was a sticky situation for sure, but we knew one day we would end up at Moes simply because of our need to know. Today turned out to be that day.It was nice out and since Moes has a patio we decided to go that route. The waitress came right over and ran right off to get us a couple mugs of Duff (yes, we tried the Duff - not bad really). The lunchtime Fish Fry at Moes is the same one youll find at dinner and shares the full $12 price tag. Before the fish we were treated to a surprisingly fresh salad mix, which was elegantly complimented by a pleasant balsamic vinaigrette dressing. It was a very nice, albeit untraditional, start to the meal. Well played, Moe. The fish came in a wax paper lined dish about 10 minutes after we exhausted the salads, and was scalding hot. The slightly larger than average duo was joined by a heap of fries, some remoulade (which sat in for the tartar), and a soup-cup full of coleslaw. Immediately I noticed some grease oozing out of one of the pieces so without missing a beat I flipped em both to avoid the dreaded Soggy Batter Syndrome. SBS has taken many-a good Fish Fry in our time, but if we all work together we CAN prevent it.  It just requires diligence and a conscious effort to Turn as you taste. Say it with me people Turn as you taste, Turn as you taste. Together, we will beat this thing...Eventually the oozing subsided and I got the fish in hand. The cod was flaky and hand battered  which alone is a huge step up from Zanders. While the batter looked like it was going to be peppery and spicy, it didnt really deliver. While the flaky fish looked like it was coated with Kentucky Fried Chickens breading, it lacked any of the Colonels signature pep. By and large, it was acceptable but looked like it should have been much, much better.  The French fries also kept up appearances, but unlike the fish, delivered on their promise. The spuds gave the impression they were cut in house, but as Jer said, they didnt eat like it. They just had a frozen taste, which wasnt bad at all, but just didnt taste like they were fresh. They still tasted yummy and were good enough for me, unlike the treasonous tartar.Never have I heard of substituting a Remoulade for tartar, but Moes has apparently gone there. The surrogate sauce was spicy and simply dominated the fish when used. It had some serious heat, which really shouldnt be necessary and is actually undesirable when I want to taste the flavor of my fish. Lets agree to skip the gimmicks and get back to the thick and creamy standard, shall we? The last link in the chain was Moes so-so slaw. While the mix was fresh and looked great, it didnt have the zip you like in a good slaw. Whats more, the chain had a missing link as Moes doesnt serve bread with their fish, preventing the loop from fully closing.After sampling the Fish Fry at Moes I think its safe to say that it would be right at home on The Simpsons dinner table. While it looked like it had potential, the tastes were bland, and it certainly didnt justify the $12. Overall, we cant recommend the Fish Fry at Moes Tavern & Grill, and will probably just head to The Fryin Dutchman next time.www.moestavernandgrill.com118 State StreetMadison, WI 53703     (608) 280-9999",3488,0.14122679580306702,0.499327414581652

Its always a bit of a crap-shoot, and you never know what youre gonna get, especially when your waitress is a little long in the tooth. When we showed up at Seven Seas we werent sure what we were gonna get, but based on the recommendation of some friends, expected the absolute best. What we got was good, but thanks to our waitress (whose name escapes me, but I know rhymed with a part of the female anatomy), was not as superb as it could have been.To begin, there is a lot to like about Seven Seas. The place is really swanky, the staff seems very friendly, and they have top-notch views. We had no trouble getting a table, but then again the place wasnt necessarily packed (which was somewhat surprising based on their reputation). Eventually our waitress (Mulva?) arrived, took our orders, set us up with a fresh round of drinks, and began to slowly bring wave after wave of food. It started with a basket of salted rye slices, followed by family-style bowls of sweet vinegar coleslaw, and delicious homemade potato salad. We feasted on these treats, but were conscious not to fill up too much since the $15 cod is all you can eat. Abstaining proved to be a difficult task as we were left with the enticing entities for an extended period of time, due to our waitresss general lethargy. Something like 20-30 minutes passed before she (Celeste?) brought the first family-style plate which was relatively small, consisting of a mere two potato pancakes for the four people that ordered them. It was a little bizarre, but the cakes were supplemented by a decent amount of fries and about 8 fat chunks of fish, so we rolled with it. The portions were kind of odd, but we tore into what we got with reckless abandon trying to make sure everyone got a taste of what they wanted. Unfortunately, we were not greeted by steam and it was apparent that the cod sat for a bit before we got it. Regardless, the fish was high quality, and flaked apart perfectly. It hosted a light, crumbly breading which was really well done. When she (Gipple?) came back, we ordered another round of fish, and six more potato pancakes per her suggestion (seriously, on the first round we get two, and she suggests six on the re-up again, we were lost on the whole portion methodology). The fish and cakes were much hotter on round two and made up somewhat for the lackluster first effort... always leave em smiling, I guess.Like the fish, the potato pancakes were not hot enough on the first go-round, and could have used a little crisping-up. Even so, they tasted excellent, as did the well-seasoned fries which were expertly fried. Between the cakes, the potato salad, and the fries, there are some seriously super spuds at Seven Seas and were glad we got to sample them all. The tartar came in a big soup cup and when we drained the first she (Bovary?) gladly brought us a refill, even though the turn-around took a bit which caused us to take a few un-sauced bites. The sauce was thick and creamy, and mercifully took some of the focus off the lukewarm first-round fish, but really enhanced the hotter second round.It took a while for us to finally make the drive to Seven Seas, but in the end it was definitely worth it. Perhaps the slower than average service was just a little poetic justice for our own tardiness? Overall, we still highly recommend this Fish Fry despite the fact the food suffered somewhat from its slow delivery. Its too bad, because despite her speed our waitress was really nice and very helpful if only we could remember her name oh wait Dolores! www.sevenseaswi.com1807 Nagawicka RoadHartland, WI 53029     (262) 367-3903",3744,0.1438392857142857,0.5227116402116401

When you pick your fish you choose perch since it is freshly caught, and fresh fish gets harder to come by the further south you go. All that remains to be seen is exactly how well the establishment can fry their pristine catch. In the case of the Cornerstone Pub, they can do it pretty damn well. On Friday nights the CSP pulls out all the stops and has a pan-fried perch special, but since we were there before 4:00 we were limited to the deep-fried variety (which is our preference anyway). The standard order runs $12.00 for three butterflies, with the option to tack on as many as you like for three bucks a pop. I put in an order for a Spotted Cow and four butterflies and had the steaming hot fish in front of me in almost no time.As far as deep fried perch goes, this stuff was excellent. It tasted very fresh and had a velvety texture that melted in your mouth. I slurped down the first two butterflies in effortless gulps between sips of the ice cold Cow.  Its true, the breading could have used a bit more spice to balance the sweet fish, but by and large it was superb. The coating was light and fried to the idyllic golden-brown color that DC Perch is known for. After trying the deep fried, we simply must get back up and try the pan fried, and who knows, the walleye, haddock, and whitefish are fair game. Where the fish selection at the Cornerstone goes above and beyond, the potato selection falls flat (at least during lunch). The only option was crinkle-cut French fries, which were on the level, but about as mediocre as you can get. The tartar also fell within one standard deviation of the mean, with a slightly above average texture, but a slightly below average amount of relish. While we at MFF like a thick, mayo-based sauce, we do appreciate a little dill as it helps to finish off the sweetness of the fresh perch with a little zip. Door County is still apparently on-board with the whole rye bread thing - something you are seeing less and less in the city. Not one, but two full pieces of dark rye came with the lunch perch at the Cornerstone and were a great addition helping to cleanse the palate in between bites of fish.Last, and probably least, was the pubs slaw which was creamy and inoffensive, but lacked a punch. While Im sure there are a lot of folks out there that really like the inoffensive blend, we prefer some thump whether it be a vinegar twang or a zesty mayo blast. Im not sure there is a better way to kick off a DC weekend that with a Fish Fry at the Cornerstone. The food was great, the establishment is clean and well cared for, and the staff seemed to be top-notch. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and have a feeling it is going to become a mainstay in our Door County vacations for years to come. www.baileysharborcornerstonepub.com/8123 ST HWY 57Bailey's Harbor, WI 54202     (920) 839-9001",2912,0.12159288194444443,0.4782942708333333

We were younger, wilder, pre-child, and showed up late thinking the crowd would be thin and the fish would be hot. Well, 8:00 is pretty late, but apparently not late enough to thin this crowd. We still waited a good 30 minutes for a table and when we finally got a spot our waitress was clearly ready to be done. She was curt and fully expected to throw in couple more orders of fish and call it a night. When my then-vegetarian wife pinged her with various questions about substitutions and the like she was met with a very ""it is what it is"" attitude. It soured the whole meal, and when my fish came lukewarm it was easy for me to write the whole thing off. Best of Door County my eye...Time heals all wounds as they say, and for our 2019 trip to DoCo I vowed to try the Bowl again and see if that one bad experience was the exception or the rule. It turns out 2012 was an EXTREME exception... 7 years, one child, about 500 Fish Frys, and many lessons learned later we got to experience the SBB in all its glory. This time we showed up to an overflowing parking lot at 4:45 and got our names on the waiting list pronto. We killed an hour or so milling around the lanes, playing bar games, sipping stiff Old Fashioneds, and enjoying the company of our friends from Manitowoc. When we got our spot in the dining room overlooking the Sister Bay hill our party of six was met by a kind and patient waitress. All the cards were falling into place this time. The Fish Fry of record at the Bowl is lake perch (as it should be) and they aren't exactly giving it away (as they shouldn't be). The plate is composed of four fat butterflies (that's 8 fillets for any novices in the room) and these babies are silky smooth with the absolute lightest breading imaginable. This is what lake perch is supposed to taste like - just enough breading to add some depth, but light enough that the perch is what you taste first and last. It's so smooth and so balanced one could easily cram 'em in without tartar, but the sauce definitely makes them something more. The tartar in this case was thick as molasses and about ten times as tasty. It gives the perch just what it wants - a little kick without overshadowing its inherent delicate sweetness. A bevy of fat crinkle-cut fries support the star as well, and while they aren't going to win any awards they don't need to. They're here to do a job and to that end their mission is achieved. Some house slaw also does it's job without trying to co-star, and the creamy concoction rounds things out admirably.  All fish, fries, slaw, and sauce aside (and that's a big aside) the Sister Bay Bowl goes straight-up supper club with a real loaf of slice-it-yourself bread on a mini-cutting board. What's more, this loaf isn't just straight up white or rye - it's a half and half! Never before have I seen such a feat and I almost didn't know how to handle myself once I saw it. I swear gazing upon its majesty I saw the eyes of God and he smiled back saying this is the gift I give for you. Praise be. Bad service can sour even the heartiest Fish Fry fan and I have no problem admitting that it happened to me. It took me a while to come around, but I'm glad I finally gave the legendary Bowl a second chance. I have no problem saying that it lived up to the hype and then some. It really is everything a Fish Fry should be and it's no wonder people consider it the Best of Door County. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry. The ambiance and the waitress were fantastic and the perch is easily worthy of Top 25 status.

We usually give people the benefit of the doubt, and always try to see the bright side, especially when we are talking about Fish Frys. That probably stems from the fact that we love our fish, and more often than not feel like most places do it right (way to go Wisco!). However, there are a lot of places that get very busy on Friday nights due to their reputation as Fish Fry hot-spots, and sometimes these crowds have an adverse effect on the wait staff. Unfortunately, thats the scenario that played out for us at The Sister Bay Bowl.We arrived pretty late (8:30) and figured wed be in-n-out in no time. Since weve been to the Bowl for beverages a few times before we kinda knew what we needed to do, and had a table within our 15 minute quoted wait time. At this point in the evening it was still busy, but not exactly what youd call crazy-busy. We had a chance to sit and look over the menu, and eventually figured out which waitress was ours when she walked by and looked down her nose at us crossly - not a good start. Eventually, she painted on a fake smile and came by to take our orders. While the menu was fairly straight forward, we (mostly my vegetarian wife) had a couple questions which were answered curtly and not to our satisfaction. Fearing further reprisal, she quickly threw an order together as best she could on partial information, while I opted for the standard Door County perch that comes with French fries (do not even try to inquire about hash browns, or risk further scowling). Medusa then left to put the order in leaving us feeling like wed just been brow-beaten. In no more than three minutes our food appeared  I kid you not, it was that fast. It was almost alarming to have a full plate in front of me that quickly and I immediately wondered how it was even possible at first taste I knew this fish wasnt fried just for me. The SBB is clearly running an assembly line Fish Fry where they just fry a bunch and fill plates as orders for it appear  never good for fried foods. My four butterflies were lukewarm, but still maintained a delicate texture (a sign of fresh fish). Even at the tepid temps they tasted good, and featured the typical golden Door County breading, but unlike other breading weve had in Door, you could taste a little extra hint of spice. Surely, had we gotten a freshly fried batch, this perch would have been superb. Apparently another DoCo norm is crinkle-cut fries, which, while acceptable if they come in an AYCE, are less than desirable when plated with my perch. These were as basic as it gets, but were at least hot. The tartar was also a bit too basic as it looked to be about 99% mayo and 1% relish. While it was thick, it had an unhealthy gloss that made it look a bit unappetizing and little flavor since it was almost straight mayo. A fresh cabbage and vinegar coleslaw was also basic, but not in a bad way. The sweet vinegar had a nice zip which really would have gone well with the half rye/half white loaf of bread (had we received it). Truth be told, we did receive it, but only because we went out of our way to ask for it. In her haste to get us out the door she totally spaced it (or more than likely intentionally didnt bring it). By the time we did get it I was too full to even try the rye (and I live to cut up those little loaves). Sad face. Off-putting service aside, we still have some issues with this Fish Fry, namely the assembly-line manner in which the food is prepared, and the lack of options for customers willing to pay for an upgrade  the take it or leave it philosophy is rarely acceptable when youre talking Fish Fry (some people just want more than fries or a baked potato). Overall, we still barely recommend this Fish Fry and have to imagine that if we had a more pleasurable experience they might even reach highly recommended territory  the fish seemed worthy. www.sisterbaybowl.com/10640 North Bay Shore DriveSister Bay, WI 54234     (920) 854-2841",4006,0.08262441592798735,0.5120256991685563

Obviously, being Copps, take-out is going to be your only option. Whether you choose to sit in your car in the parking lot or try to race home, time is not your friend when Styrofoam containers are involved with Fish Fry. Needless to say the fish isnt going to be freshly fried to begin with (unless you get extremely lucky), but the added time in transit only hinders it further. By the time I got mine home lukewarm would have been a luxury.Sure, I could have heated it up some, but I was hungry and decided to bite the bullet. Though it was less than fresh the $6.00 2-piece cod actually tasted good, at least as good as cold-ish fish can. While flakiness was and afterthought at this point a light breading still lent the cod a notable flavor. It was also virtually grease-free which was impressive considering the circumstances. The floppy fish was hard to hold, and a little tricky to dip, but was really about as good as you can expect all things considered. Since its basically just a meal from Copps deli case the side options with the Fish Fry were plentiful. Being a stickler for tradition I bucked the onion rings, and played off the macaroni salad, opting instead for the classic wedge fries and a side of coleslaw. The wedges travelled better than the cod and were presumably fried after its friend. The plump spuds were zesty and satisfying, and we wouldnt hesitate to get them again. The coleslaw was also good with a Wilsons-like creaminess, but a much tastier finish. Commercial tartar might be fine for the masses, and who knows, maybe fish sticks with Heinz tartar are the bees knees? I couldnt tell ya, but it still isnt what I want with my Fish Fry, and while the two packets of sauce sufficed, it certainly didnt help the fish, which really could have used the boost that homemade tartar usually provides.A slice of marble rye did all it could, but suffice it to say a dry little piece of bread simply couldnt make up the ground lost by the unoriginal tartar and the tepid fish.  So, this is a tough one. On one hand, this Fish Fry is a great deal, and tastes pretty good. But on the other hand, it isnt made to order which means it isnt going to be scalding hot the way we like it. It is a bit of a double-edge sword and while wed really love to give Copps the benefit of the doubt, when the fish isnt hot the Fish Fry aint cool. Overall, we dont recommend this Fish Fry right based on this experience, but thats not to say we wont ever be back in hopes of finding hotter fish. Well just have to make sure we pre-heat the oven next time. www.copps.com2502 Shopko DriveMadison, WI 53704     (608) 243-1000",2706,0.18205555555555558,0.5113968253968254

People change. Heck, even restaurant ownership changes. There is no doubt our world is a dynamic one and when youre in Wisconsin and youre talking Fish Fry change is a big part of the landscape. Sure, the best of the best are, and will always be, just what they are, but there are fledgling Frys out there that are just trying to make a go of it in this crazy Fish Fry Universe. A recent change in ownership brought The Roost Pub & Grill onto our radar and along with it rumors of a Fish Fry far exceeding that of its predecessor The Klubhouse. We took notice, and paid them a visit as soon as we got a chance.Sometimes MFF flys solo, and other times we have a big group - this time around it was the latter. We showed up at The Roost Pub & Grill eight deep, which worked out really well since they werent very busy. Our party basically took over the main dining room and seemingly had a waitress all to ourselves (which turned out to be necessary since she was mildly overwhelmed with our numbers). There are a couple fish options at The Roost on Friday nights and I chose the $13 cod over the $15 walleye (although both sounded excellent). The fish came in due time and was nice and hot when we got it  a good start. The cod featured a seasoned beer batter that was good, but didnt have quite punch I anticipated. The batter was also slightly thicker than it was billed to be, which led to it holding the tiniest bit of grease. From time to time a splash of wayward oil dribbled down my fingers but it was nothing I (and a couple napkins) couldnt handle. All told it added up to three hefty chunks of fish that were satisfying, but not quite as flavorful as we expected. The French fries followed suit and while the portion was gratifying, the Julienne-cut potatoes were nothing special. Maybe we were simply expecting too much, but if you want to run with the big dogs in these parts youd to step your game up. Average just isnt gonna cut it. Good not great seems to be the name of the game on the 19th hole, and The Roost tartar also rode the B-train. While it was creamy and thick, it was a little heavy on the relish. Although to the credit of The Roost, the spunky sauce stood its ground against the amply batter cod while a lesser sauce would likely have fallen flat. Clearly some thought went into the flavor combination, so well give them some love. Garnering a few bonus points was some marble rye that came along for the round. Unfortunately, where the portions were huge everywhere else, they skimped on the rye, offering a mere half of a tiny slice. The coleslaw returned to form and the bounty was creamy and inoffensive.  We have to give some credit to The Roost Pub & Grill. They said theyve upped the ante when it comes to Fish Fry and to some degree they delivered. While it still wasnt quite as good as we hoped, the cod has improved dramatically over its predecessor, and everything else played its roll admirably. We appreciated the generous portions, the clean spacious atmosphere, and the attentive service, but overall, we really don't recommend this Fish Fry, and have to say we were expecting a bit more based on the buzz.88 Hawks Landing CircleVerona, WI 53593     (608) 848-5751",3234,0.11920701058201057,0.4693835978835979

We had our sights set on bigger and better fish, but unfortunately the fish of our affection unexpectedly rode off into the sunset. Adios Farm Table, Adios great fish. Adios yet another Middleton establishment. It was a good, albeit brief, run. We showed up at the Free House on a whim hoping for somethingsomething moresomething bettersomething wed be happy to eat. Heres to hopingThe Free House still has cod every Friday, but as weve been underwhelmed by it in the past we went walleye this week. The $15 freshwater fillet is average in most every way  size, flavor, and consistency. The focus of the fish is a dark cornmeal breading that has very little, if any, flavor. A little grease also seeped from its flaky loins which was surprising, but not entirely unexpected. Enough fries to cover the plate in a single layer followed the fish, but as you might have guessed were nowhere near numerous. Theyre not cut in-house, theyre not perfectly fried, theyre not amazing in any way. Theyre just okay, which can be passable if you have great fish. If you have great fish No one wants a runny tartar sauce and this thin mix didnt mesh well with the fish. Being that it is a sauce it lacks extremities, which didnt leave it a leg to stand on. Feel free to kick that aroundA puny portion of slaw was next on the gnashing block, and while miniscule, was very tasty. Sure, I would have liked more, especially since the fish was far from a filler upper, but as they say, you get what you get and you dont throw a fit. Fittingly, no bread came with this Fish Fry which left no taste in my mouth, much less a bad taste. While we didnt expect greatness from the Free House we were hoping to be pleasantly surprised; unfortunately it simply wasnt meant to be. Overall, we dont recommend this Fish Fry and surely wont be dropping fifteen more bucks here any time soon. Too bad too, since the place itself is quite nice.

What can I say? I love Fish Frys. When I hear of a new Fish Fry I simply must try it and waste no time doing it. Thats just the way it is. When a new place opened in Middleton to favorable reviews, AND was sporting a Fish Fry I knew what had to be done. I got right over there Friday permitting of course. As youd expect of any new place in downtown Middleton on a Friday night, the recently opened Free House Pub & Grill was bustling. It was a lovely evening and their outdoor patio was practically overflowing into the street. We confidently strode through the masses on our way to the front door although we had no idea of its actual location, only a feeling - it was as if some sort of Fish Fry force was luring us forward. We found the door and flung it wide, quickly finding the hostess, and asking about the wait. 45 minutes? she said. Aghast, though we were, we rolled with the punch and told her no problem. It turned out we were right. The service at the bar wasnt exactly what youd call white lightning, but we eventually managed to get some drinks and within 15 minutes of putting our name on the list had a table  well chalk the poor estimate up to inexperience for now. We followed the hostess, squishing through the packed bar until we emerged in the rear dining room, and there we saw it  an unused grotto-like space, complete with a fireplace, TVs, and couches. The posh space instantly gave us remorse as we spent our 15 crammed in at the bar when we could have been kicking back in the lap of luxury. It was a bit of a bummer, but again, we rolled with it. Our waiter was basically fantastic and it started the second we sat down. He came right over, and ran to get us a refresher while giving us a chance to glance at the menu. I of course had no interest in the literature, and when he returned I wasted no time ordering the $10.00 cod with a side of fries. While the fish arrived relatively quickly it was not scalding hot. The 3-piece featured an extremely light and crumbly batter which had a hard time hanging onto the cod. It basically fell right off but saved face with some spice and decent flavor. Perhaps it clung so poorly due to the surprisingly greasy fish? Im not sure where the grease originated since the cod was flaky and clean, but it was definitely there resulting in fish that looked better than it actually tasted. Some shoestring-style fries also looked the part, but in this case actually delivered. They were crispy, yet supple, bordering on perfection. Unfortunately, they came in a fairly small portion which was less than satisfying. The tartar was also surprisingly satisfactory even though my initial reaction was not good. At first bite I could have sworn I tasted a Kraft-like concoction, but the more I sampled the more it grew on me. By the end I actually thought it was pretty decent, although certainly nowhere near the top tartars around town.All things considered the highlight of this Fish Fry might have been the coleslaw. The house-made mix was fresh and had a wonderfully crisp finish. If you are a fan of the finely-chopped style slaw this is one you will love. One thing you wont (or at least shouldnt) love is the fact that no bread comes with the Free House Fish Fry. This isnt meant to be a damning review or anything even remotely resembling that. We actually liked the Free House very much. The place is new and nice, the drinks are stiff, and the atmosphere is cool. But when you look at the Fish Fry it didnt quite measure up and I cant recommend it as is. However, I think we can chalk most of the idiosyncrasies up to the fact that they are getting their feet wet and learning as they go. I have faith they will figure out the subtle nuances of the Fish Fry soon enough at which point well come back and give them another shot. www.freehousepub.com1902 Parmenter StreetMiddleton, WI 53562     (608) 831-5000",3914,0.14093277093277096,0.48902634402634404

I have never been to the popular weekend retreat before and really didnt have any idea what to expect. It turns out LG pretty much like any other touristy destination in Wisconsin, complete with higher-than-average prices and wider-than-average selections. Hey, people are there to spend money and have a good time which makes for a good business climate and  a lot of competition  especially when it comes to Friday Fish Fry.As per usual, there are four or five places in the area that claim to have The Best Fish Fry in Lake Geneva, which always makes selecting one a bit of a crapshoot. I did as much research as I could and eventually settled on Popeyes since A) Most of their reviews were at least marginally positive, B) It was right near our hotel, and C) They supposedly make a whale of a Bloody Mary. We met a few friends there for lunch, grabbed some bloodies, and got some food. A couple of us went for the AYCE Fish Fry while most branched out and tried their luck with the everyday menu. While Popeyes may have a bit of the Applebees/TGIFridays feel to it, I think it is more genuine than those kinds of places. It actually seems like the stuff that has accumulated over the years, not just been slapped together by some kitschy designer. While Id still prefer the personality youll find in a small town tavern or supper club, Popeyes wasnt overly commercial. The AYCE runs a reasonable $12 (an $18 lake perch is also on the everyday menu) and ours came relatively quickly. Since we had a couple cod crunchers our fish, fries, and potato pancakes all came out on a family-style platter. Hull and I dove in, divvying out the delights onto our personal plates. The cod was cut in long finger-like pieces which were fairly substantial (probably a good 4 oz. each). The fish was light, but not super flaky. It was bolstered somewhat by a light breading that was a little lax on the spice, but also had parsley or some such nonsense in it for decoration. The pale coating clung to the cod well, but really could have used some more pep.  Lake Geneva is in the SW portion of the state so they feature something you dont see in the Madison area very often - potato pancakes. Like the fish, the PPs are AYCE, and good, not great. They are clearly made in-house as evidenced by their crispy brown perimeters and supple centers. Unfortunately, like the fish, they lacked any sort of zest, especially the subtle onion undertone that good pancakes feature. The battered French fries also come with the AYCE and actually outshone the pancakes in my opinion. They were crispy and delicious, and really make the potato options at Popeyes much more appealing. AYCE fish requires a lot of tartar and Popeyes has no problem playing along. Their personal brew comes in gigantic cups, is zippy and semi-creamy, but a bit heavy on the dill for my taste. Still, it was mild enough, and made the fish more palatable so Ill give them credit.Strangely, with so much fried food flying around there was no bread served with the fish. Maybe it was just a lunch time thing, or maybe they just forgot, but for whatever reason it wasnt there and not there is not acceptable. The coleslaw was also not acceptable as it had white beans in it (weird) and no pop whatsoever. Blech. Just blech.In the end, the All You Can Eat Fish Fry at Popeyes was a lot like Lake Geneva itself  while it is interesting, and I would recommend trying it once, Im not sure if Id go back of my own volition. The fish was clean and abundant (much like the town itself), the fries and potato pancakes gave you options to choose from (much like the town itself), the tartar was feisty, but a little off (very much like the town itself), and the slaw was ugly at times (exactly like the town itself). Overall, we feel fine recommending this Fish Fry if you happen to find yourself in Lake Geneva on a Friday and in need of a good, solid meal, but as far as the best in town, Im not so sure. popeyeslkg.com811 Wrigley DriveLake Geneva, WI 53174     (262) 248-4381",4080,0.1652167109998435,0.5014933326379111

You never really wanted to go to Pops but sometimes you just had to. It always seemed that no matter what you ate you always left feeling the same way - like there was a rock in your stomach. This led me to develop a theory about the food at Pops which I dubbed the grey powder theory. It was adapted from a book I once read and went something like this: everything at Pops was made from the same basic powder substance, but molded and flavored to look like varying foods. So, the burger you had for lunch and the spaghetti you had for dinner were all made from the same base substance and just shaped, colored, flavored, whatever, to look like what they wanted it to look like. When the food reached your stomach it turned back into the grey powder and thus left you with the same crappy feeling every time. While I was never able to prove my theory I recently had an experience that left me believing it was still a possibility. A grey powder Fish FryHy-vee is a grocery store (and what seems to be a nice one at that).

In fact, of our 720+ Fish Frys weve only been to one other grocery store Fish Fry. Apparently Hy-vee has a fairly substantial kitchen with a seating area and has special buffets throughout the week. Of course, in Wisconsin this means there is going to be a Friday Fish Fry.While there is an AYCE option for a few dollars more I felt my decision to go for the $8.00 single trip was sage. One time through still allows you up to six pieces and while they are on the smallish side they do add up. There are a lot of options including a bunch of baked fish (haddock among them) as well as three fried varieties (cod, lake perch and catfish). The sides were also abundant and would turn out to be the highlight (midlight?) of the meal.In classic buffet fashion the fish had been sitting for a while and was lukewarm and rubbery (this is the biggest problem with buffets and why I usually avoid them altogether). Both the cod and the lakeperch were very bland and not flaky in the slightest  fish that sits around rarely is. In addition, the batter was too thick and didnt offer much flavor. While it did appear to be hand-battered, the length of time that passed between frying and eating was clearly more than this fish could bear. Perhaps the freshly fried batch that appeared moments after we sat down was better? I dont know, but I do know that what we ate didnt do my gut any favors. Easing the pain somewhat was the plethora of side options, some of which were actually appealing. The mac-n-cheese turned out to be delicious, as were the party potatoes. The largest potato wedges I have ever seen were also available, and while they tasted delicious, they certainly contributed heavily to the boulder-belly that ensued. A super pungent, and very mass-produced tasting, tartar was off-putting to say the least. It was repugnant and didnt help the already weak fish one iota. Likewise, the coleslaw was tasteless, adding little if anything to the meal, some gut-rot aside. The fish was lumpy, and the sides were heavy in their own right, but the real anchor that drug us into the depths was the roll. While it was lush, and chewy, with a subtle sweetness, it was incredibly dense. It almost felt like easting a memory-foam mattress or something similarily unappetizing. It was a meal in and of itself and really snuck up on me to deliver the final belly blow. While I wasnt expecting the world from the Hy-vee Fish Fry I still probably had my expectations too high. The sides and such were all perfectly acceptable, but the fish was just not up to snuff, and thats really what its about after all. Part of it is the buffet style, and part of it is just the quality of the product, but when all was said and done I had that same old feeling I had after eating at Pops back in college  a belly full of grey powder.

It's basically the traditional stadium fare - pre-battered fish fillets, freezer fries, and a side of commercial tartar sauce that is anything but fancy. So, when I heard that the Mallards were throwing a special Fish Fry to commemorate the opening of their new Duck Blind Box Seats, I wasn't expecting whole lot. When I heard the tickets were $22 I as even less intrigued, but after reading the description of the event my ears perked up a bit...$22 seems like a lot but when you consider it included two drink tickets it becomes a little more palatable (especially since they weren't just rail drinks either - think Bulleit Bourbon and Wollersheim Gin). The fish was either bluegill or cod - both of which shared the same beer batter. We got one of each and since the bluegill was mine, we'll start there. The first thing I noticed was the size of the fillets - they were huge and there were only three to an order. There is really no way they could be bluegill, but they were definitively some sort of sunfish...maybe crappie, maybe something else? I don't know for sure, but I've never seen a bluegill of this magnitude, and since it also didn't have that inherent bluegill flavor I'm going to stick to my guns on this one. The cod on the other hand was definitively cod, and clearly high quality. It was pure white, flaky as can be, and worked perfectly with the superb beer batter. This was anything but a pre-battered fillet, and the light and flaky coating had a unique flavor that I just loved. The batter worked better with the cod than the bluegill (which beer batter typically does) but didn't diminish the flavor of either. There were two sides to chose from and since we got two orders of fish we got to try one of each. The French fries were crispy battered and very good, but the potato pancakes were next level. These cakes were the real deal; they were clearly made in-house and had a subtle onion flavor and served with apple sauce on the side. They were very nicely done and yet another pleasant surprise on Northport Drive. Keeping pace with the fish and the spuds was a surprisingly good tartar. It was plenty thick and perfectly pungent, a real people pleaser to be sure. The slaw also did it's job, and a slice of real rye bread brought things home. Once in a while life throws you a curve ball and I have to say the made-to-order Fish Fry in the Duck Blind took me by surprise. The Mallards definitely didn't phone this one in and if they make this an option on Friday nights I might just go out of my way to attend an extra game or two in the sweet new suites. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and really hope it wasn't just an off-season thing. If they can keep this going during the summer it will undoubtedly put butts in the seats.  www.mallardsbaseball.com/2920 N.

So, when I heard that the Mallards were throwing a special Fish Fry to commemorate the opening of their new Duck Blind Box Seats, I wasn't expecting whole lot. When I heard the tickets were $22 I as even less intrigued, but after reading the description of the event my ears perked up a bit...$22 seems like a lot but when you consider it included two drink tickets it becomes a little more palatable (especially since they weren't just rail drinks either - think Bulleit Bourbon and Wollersheim Gin). The fish was either bluegill or cod - both of which shared the same beer batter. We got one of each and since the bluegill was mine, we'll start there. The first thing I noticed was the size of the fillets - they were huge and there were only three to an order. There is really no way they could be bluegill, but they were definitively some sort of sunfish...maybe crappie, maybe something else? I don't know for sure, but I've never seen a bluegill of this magnitude, and since it also didn't have that inherent bluegill flavor I'm going to stick to my guns on this one. The cod on the other hand was definitively cod, and clearly high quality. It was pure white, flaky as can be, and worked perfectly with the superb beer batter. This was anything but a pre-battered fillet, and the light and flaky coating had a unique flavor that I just loved. The batter worked better with the cod than the bluegill (which beer batter typically does) but didn't diminish the flavor of either. There were two sides to chose from and since we got two orders of fish we got to try one of each. The French fries were crispy battered and very good, but the potato pancakes were next level. These cakes were the real deal; they were clearly made in-house and had a subtle onion flavor and served with apple sauce on the side. They were very nicely done and yet another pleasant surprise on Northport Drive. Keeping pace with the fish and the spuds was a surprisingly good tartar. It was plenty thick and perfectly pungent, a real people pleaser to be sure. The slaw also did it's job, and a slice of real rye bread brought things home. Once in a while life throws you a curve ball and I have to say the made-to-order Fish Fry in the Duck Blind took me by surprise. The Mallards definitely didn't phone this one in and if they make this an option on Friday nights I might just go out of my way to attend an extra game or two in the sweet new suites. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and really hope it wasn't just an off-season thing. If they can keep this going during the summer it will undoubtedly put butts in the seats.  www.mallardsbaseball.com/2920 N.

Hed gotten them from a friend who was part of the Tircor group and thus had some connections with the team. We arrived at the stadium planning to skip the fish, opting instead to just eat the free brats that came with the tailgate (they didnt have a Fish Fry at the main concession stand this Friday anyway, only a fish sandwich). Sounds like a good plan, right? Well, upon hearing that the Amazing Madison Fish Fry was in attendance (Jers cousin spilled the beans) our host (the Tricor guy) decided that the fish must be tried come hell or high water. We were left with little recourse.Now keep in mind, at this point I wasnt really hungry since Id just wolfed down a couple fully-loaded brats, but our generous host insisted on getting us the fish. Within 10 minutes he delivered, and Jer and I had four pieces of unrequested, steaming hot cod in our hands. We did the only thing we rally could do, and gave it a shot, I mean, Im not one to turn away free fish regardless of the situation its served in. It was clear just from looking at the cod that it was a pre-battered frozen fillet. It was just like the fish served at places like The Glass Nickel, which is about as tasty as a frozen fillet can get, but still not in the same ballpark as a real Fish Fry. Yes it did taste fine, but it was not hand-battered, and believe it or not, that does make a difference. I fully realize serving a crowd the size the Mallards do makes a homemade Fish Fry impossible, but Im just calling balls and strikes here. It is what it is. The tartar sauce was just a couple Heinz packets jammed alongside the fish  which is also just what it is. Were not big fans of Heinz, in case you were wondering.Before we could get through the fish and tartar packets a second paper tray appeared, this one overflowing with French fires. The shoestring style fries were really great, although its hard to know if your average Joe would get the same incredibly fresh and abundant portion. I kind of doubt it, but the ones we got were superb, so take that for what its worth. I had one hand full of fish and another full of fries and for the first time was actually happy there was no coleslaw or bread with it. Usually, Id be upset at the lack of sides, but this was almost merciful in a way. So, that whole experience was new for us, but if that wasnt enough as we sat in the bleachers during the 5th inning our host raced up to us again. Here, you gotta try this! he said. We looked down to see him holding more fish. Ugh. Its catfish! He said gleefully. And again, more food was thrust upon us. Since we had no option, we each took a piece and decided to see what was what. Remarkably, the catfish was way better than the cod (although to be fair wed had a few more beers at this point) and I actually enjoyed it thoroughly. It appeared to have been hand-battered with a zesty coating, and fried perfectly. It was a big step up from its frozen friend, although again, I really could have gone without the additional forced feeding. While this wasnt what Id call a Fish Fry for the ages (or even a Fish Fry period), a Mallards game at the Duck Pond is a great experience for all ages. The atmosphere of the park is lively, and the games are sure to entertain. In all honesty, I think I can say that out of all the food Ive eaten at the Duck Pond, the catfish is probably one of the tastier things. Unfortunately, as far as a full-fledged Fish Fry goes, it just doesnt add up. Overall, I highly recommend the Mallards, but really cant say the same for the Fish Fry. But hey, if youre going to a Mallards game looking for top-notch fish youre already missing the point - go for the brats, go for the fun, go support your hometown team, and dont feel bad if the fish isnt on your list. I wouldnt.www.mallardsbaseball.com/2920 N. Sherman AvenueMadison, WI 53704     (608) 246-4277",4165,0.1939780322017164,0.5111401135414292

There are just so many options in our fair city that the sacred Wisconsin tradition can come across as a cutsie or superfluous.  It is anything but. In Wisconsins small-town taverns the Friday Fish Fry is taken much more seriously, not only as an important meal, but as a chance to get out and see your neighbors, and shoot this sh*t. It is integral in community life, and in no community is that more evident than in tiny Hill Point, WI.Hill Point is home to the Villa Inn which serves as the town meeting place come Friday night. When we arrived at 6:30 pm we encountered what must have been half of the local population and an hour long wait at the bar (complete with Don, the owner, and the oldest barkeep this side of the Mississip). Since the place was packed we were lucky to even get our order in (you have to hunt down the lone waitress and give it to her on the fly) more or less get seated as fast as we did. It was mayhem in the tiny bar, but it was fun at the same time, and when tap beer is only two bucks you really cant go wrong (unless you want something other than Miller Lite or High Life, in that case youre screwed as far as beer goes). The menu at the Villa is limited, but intriguing at the same time. In addition to the fish and pike (which you might expect) there is also poormans, chicken, fresh shrimp, frog legs, scallops and clam, all which ranged in price from six to eleven dollars. Even though I was mildly interest in the oddball items I just went for the fish which I correctly presumed to be cod. While it took a bit to get our table for two, once we did things went like lightning. Awaiting our arrival was a big dish of coleslaw, and a basket with buns and cellophane breadsticks. The rolls were wrapped in a towel but werent warm which was kind of strange, but whatever lm not gonna nit-pick the logic there. The four packages of cellophane sticks were a nice addition and those we didnt eat on-site easily fit into the coat pocket for later consumption. Conversely, the coleslaw was well thought out and the finely chopped, blend was nice and zesty. Between the two of us we almost exhausted the whole bowlful, partially because it was so tasty, and partially because my vegetarian wife was SOL when it came to the Friday menu. Sorry, babe.  The fish arrived shortly after and was picture perfect. The four golden, flaky filets of cod were flanked by a handful of crinkle-cut fries, and a pull-apart paper cup of tartar sauce. I wasted little time, even though the fish was alarmingly hot. As far as fish goes the Villas cod is right up there. It boasts a beer batter that is about the standard thickness, but has a very nice flavor. It has a smooth and creamy taste, but isnt overbearing like some BBs. The fish itself was flaky, but did generate a moderate amount of grease, though it wasnt bad since it didnt saturate the batter. The standard French fries were nothing special at all, but were well-fried at least. I could have used a bit more of them, but at $8.50 I dont really expect a ton so take that for what its worth. The cup of tartar was also tiny, but since it was so thick and creamy it almost lasted to the end. It was a very unique sauce and finished with a distinctive sweet flavor that was very enjoyable. We presumed some rice vinegar may have played a part, but whatever it was it was good. Hill Point isnt exactly close to Madison, but if you happen to find yourself in the Richland Center area on a Friday night (as we did) you are in for a treat. The Villa Inn is quite the little place and clearly popular for a reason  theyve got the local Fish Fry on lockdown. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry, and could easily see ourselves taking the detour to Hill Point again someday. Don done good.

Thankfully, we seem to be doing a lot more winning than losing these days (at least when it comes to Fish Frys). Weve hit on a string of great ones lately, and decided to push our luck this Friday. We gambled, threw caution to the wind, and risked it all on a rumor  hell, not even a rumor, more of a hunch. We doubled down, and hit again! Ive driven past Dolphins Bar & Grill in Lodi on any number of occasions, but for some reason never thought of them as a Fish Fry place. Im not sure why I didnt, but I just didnt - I guess I should have. The Main Street stop boasts a nice Friday menu, featuring haddock, lake perch, and a surprisingly large salad bar. While we had to wait about 10 minutes for a table, we were probably one of the few groups of the night that endured that fate since the turnover was fast and people seemed to come and go like clockwork. When we did get our spot at the window table everything went very quickly. The waitress took our order immediately, and the food came soon after. A $14 8-piece lake perch plate is available but isnt exactly cheap, so I opted for the 5-piece which was a more manageable $11. The perch fillets were very large, and home to a translucent breading that allowed the pattern on the fish on it to show through. The fish was flaky and literally fell apart at times. It was definitely the genuine article, complete with a bone or two and a slightly fishy flavor. One of the quintet had a distinct shrimpy flavor (which was unpleasant), but the other four were exceptional. The flaky fish was complemented by a light breading that had an adequate amount of seasoning. As is becoming the norm, I chose hash browns with cheese and onion as my side and was very pleased with the results. The shredded spuds were in short supply, but really tasty and generously smothered with real cheddar and red onion.  While the portion wasnt huge what was there was outstanding. Conversely, the tartar was ample and easily outlasted the perch portion. It was clearly homemade and had a nice mayo finish to go along with some black pepper and a spot-on amount of relish. It really perked up the perch, and masked the shrimpy undertone of the one ugly duckling. An average slaw came along for the ride and was acceptable, but kind of blah. It was creamy, but not creamy enough, and the small bits of cabbage were too crunchy for my tastes. The roll that accompanied was also very average, but you wont hear me complain about that (Im just glad it was there).Gambling is fun, especially when you win, and win we did. Our shot in the dark hit the bullseye in a big way, and we now have another unheralded Fish Fry in our arsenal. Overall, we highly recommend the lake perch at Dolphins Bar & Grill and will be making the trip to lovely Lodi to sample it again soon. www.facebook.com/pages/Dolphins-Bar-Grill/114149811949948111 South Main StreetLodi, WI 53555     (608) 592-1515",2953,0.20008465608465612,0.5323359788359786
http://madisonfishfry.com/reviews.php?restaurant=339,http://madisonfishfry.com/reviews.php?restaurant=339&event=757,2012-11-16,Paoli Pub & Grill,"Overall, I would recommend this Fish Fry.",Good,Good,Good,Good,Excellent,"When youre from small-town Wisconsin, the shift to living in Madison can come as a bit of a shock. The city can seem overwhelming at first, but the longer you stay the more you realize its more like a bunch of small towns smooshed together than some sort of intimidating metropolis. It really is an ideally sized city and features plenty of locally owned restaurants and taverns that tie it back to the fabric of rural Wisconsin. Still, every once in a while, a country boy (and I use that term loosely) yearns to return to places like those he grew up with; places like Norwegian Hollow in Purdy, or the aptly named Romance Tavern in Romance. The Paoli Pub is a place like this. Ive been known to say that small town bars often have great Fish Frys, and the Paoli Pub proves that point. While I really had no idea what to expect from the Belleville-area bar, I was pleasantly surprised with how nice it actually was. Unlike some small town dives, it was well-lit, well-kept, and very inviting. It was also plenty busy, but there were a couple open high-top tables and a few miscellaneous barstools so I just grabbed a beer and got to business. There was plenty of fish visible around the bar and most of it was cod (as youd expect). Its usually wise to follow suit when you see all of one style going out, but I was brazen and chose the lake perch instead because Im stubborn like that (and maybe these people just didnt know what theyre missing out on)...  I probably should have just stuck with the status quo. The lake perch runs $12 and is a fair value at that price. My plate came with five fillets, a smattering of hash browns (cheese and onion 50 cents extra), a half cup of coleslaw, a quarter cup of tartar, and a glistening dinner roll. It looked ideal, but didnt quite deliver perfection. Light and spicy breading is the way to go when it comes to lake perch, and the PP got half of that equation right. The breading, while incredibly light and crumbly, lacked any discernible seasoning, which left the fish to fend for itself. Thankfully, the delicate fillets were soft, flaky, and not overly fishy. Since the breading was basically non-existent the full flavor of the perch really came through, and while I love that taste, a little compliment from some spice would be nice. The hash browns followed a similar path, and while they looked prototypical, were missing a little something. Dont get me wrong, they were tasty, but the portion was on the small side and they spuds just werent what Id call excellent. The tartar sauce also didnt blow me away, although like everything else it was perfectly acceptable. It was chockfull of mayo, but the relish had a distinct Kraft-like twinge that turned me off a little. Adding some shine to the apple was a standard dinner roll and some finely-chopped coleslaw. The roll was incredibly soft and fresh while the slaw added the zesty pop that the fish was lacking. They really bathed everything in a more pleasant light, which made for a much more enjoyable experience when all was said and done. Next time I make my way to Paoli Ill probably go for the cod so as to get the full picture on all this Fish Fry has to offer. Thats not to say Id never get the perch again, but Im curious to see if the cod takes it all to the next level  I kinda think it does. Overall, as it stands I have no problem recommending the perch and highly recommend the Paoli Pub itself. If and when Im down that way again you know Ill be stoppin whether it's for a full-blown Fish Fry or just a couple of beers.  www.facebook.com/pages/Paoli-Pub-Grill/2106093089578416893 Paoli RdBelleville, WI 53508     (608) 845-8100",3675,0.1956628355541399,0.45749517792996053

We tried putting a square peg in a round hole - taming an untamable beast - turning a get-in-get-out kinda place into a sit-down-take-your-time kinda place. In all fairness, we weren't sure what we were getting into, but with a name like the Roast Public House we expected something a little different from what we got. You could call it false advertising, or misplaced expectations, but whatever it was, we missed the mark on this one. It was a planned-out, coordinated effort on our part (for once). We had friends who wanted to go get fish, and since everyone always wants to go downtown, Roast seemed almost too good to be true  new, downtown, vegetarian options, fish special  Boom! Lets go. The wife and I arrived early and figured we'd just sit at the bar and have a few drinks since, after all, its a public house and that's what you do at the pub, right? Wrong. Well, not totally. Roast's definition of a public house is a little loose, and the place actually feels more like a well-lit cafeteria than any sort of pub that Ive been in. That said, they have a nice bar and a pretty decent drink selection so maybe theyve just taken a more modern stance on the idea of the pub? The modus operandi at Roast involves ordering at a special counter, getting a number, and waiting for the someone to bring your food from the kitchen (kinda like Culvers in a way). This method of dining isnt exactly favorable for large groups, and no matter what we tried everything went haywire. Some of us wound up at the bar, some of us tried to save seats in the dining area, and some of us just got there and ordered thinking others had already eaten. It wound up being a bit of a shitshow (which is mostly our fault), but if the Fish Fry would have been amazing all would have been forgotten. All was not.Once we finally put our order in, the $10 Fish Frys came promptly. As you might expect, it wasnt scalding hot since it presumably had to wait for a server to come retrieve it. Lukewarm fish is a forgivable offense, if the fish is outstanding, but unfortunately this fish was not. While it was really tasty the portion was TINY - probably the smallest we have ever seen in all our years of eating Fish Frys. The three pieces were more like fingers than real pieces - each one barely the size of a mozzarella stick. The fish was flaky, and featured a light, well-seasoned breading, but it was gone so fast I hardly even had time to notice it. The three tiny swimmers were basically the equivalent of one normal piece of fish and left everyone wanting more A lot more Like 5 pieces worth... No kidding. The house made fries that came along made up for the fish somewhat, and were very good, but paled in comparison to the sweet potato fries. At least each style of fry was plentiful, which really had me wondering why the fish came in such a small quantity. Ratios, people. Ratios. Some remoulade sat in for the traditional tartar and had a unique flavor that complimented the spicy breading on the fish well. While it was a little thin, it was really tasty and made the fish disappear even quicker than it would have on its own. A semi-stale slice of sourdough necessitated some serious gnawing, as it boasted a tough crust and chewy interior. A home brewed slaw was a nice addition and featured plenty of onion to go with the usual suspects. There is no doubt in my mind that if the portion size was beefier Id have no problem recommending Roast, but as it stands I just cant. Overall, I dont recommend this Fish Fry even though the food was good, and the place is nice. Sometime size does matter, and when you compare three skimpy fillets at Roast to the full-fledged All You Can Eat Fish Fry you can get elsewhere its pretty obvious something is missing at State Streets new public house. www.roastpublichouse.com529 State StreetMadison, WI 53703     (608) 819-6457",3897,0.13603445976822595,0.5329569708790488

The Fry is a finicky mistress and is rarely mastered from the get-go. It takes time to perfect the craft and really figure out the subtleties that make one Fish Fry stand out from the next. We gave the new Country Place Café in Brooklyn a few months to figure it out, and then paid them a visit. Id still call it a work in progress at this point. The CPC bills their Friday special as a Complete Fish Fry Dinner with the first item listed being crispy coated fish. Since ambiguous terms like fish or perch are usually used for a reason I was inclined to question what kind of fish it actually was. The answer turned out to be tilapia, which is a fish you dont necessarily associate with frying (and with good reason). Unlike clean cod, or smooth haddock, tilapia tends to have a very noticeable fishy flavor, and not the delicious kind you associate with freshwater fish, but more of a saline marine/aquarium taste. While tilapia can be tasty if done right, that is usually accomplished with drawn butter, lemon juice, and skill, not breading and a deep fryer. Anyway, the fish comes in three sizes: a 1-piece for $9, a 2-piece for $11, or the 3-piece for - you guessed it - $13. I went for a 2-piece, and didnt ask any more questions since I had a pretty good lay of the land based on the menu. Once ordered the food came alarmingly fast, which surprised both my wife and I. The tilapia turned out to be fairly respectable, although it was mostly thanks to the breading and not the actual fish. The breading was well-seasoned and masked most of the ocean-y flavor (it was actually the best fried tilapia Ive had although to be fair  I havent had very much). All in all it was pretty good, but I can only imagine how much better it could have been with some nice flaky pieces of cod instead. I had high hopes for the house-cut fries, but unfortunately this batch was under-fried. It was a major disappointment because the thick julienne cut spuds had some serious potential. Luckily, I was able to help myself to the fried green beans and sweet potato fries that my wife ordered and both were superb and fried perfectly. I wasnt rally sad, cause two outta three aint bad. The tartar was also great (supposedly a family recipe) and packed a punch. It was nice and thick, but the portion was fairly small, and the two small pieces of fish literally consumed every drop. The homemade coleslaw was also above average, and while it was a little soupy on the bottom it had a subtle celery flavor that was uniquely inviting. A full slice of marble rye was cut in half, buttered and slapped back together face-to-face. I peeled it apart, spooned the slaw on and enjoyed every bite. I also enjoyed every iota of the homemade apple sauce that came along. It was really delicious and a welcomed bonus that you dont normally get with a Fish Fry. Basically everything at the CPC was above average, but could have been tweaked into greatness. If the fish was cod instead of tilapia, and the fries were fried longer youre talking highly recommendable territory right there. Unfortunately, there is still more work to be done especially when it comes to the service side of the equation. Not only did it take an inordinate amount of time to get a table, but our waitress never did come by to take our orders and the slack had to be picked up by the owners wife who was clearly aware of the situation and accommodated. Her husband (and head chef) came to our table afterwards and thanked us for eating his food (which was a unique experience for us), but he really should have been thanking her instead - she saved their ass big time. Overall, I still feel fine recommending this Fish Fry and hope they make the few subtle changes that will push them over the top. I think they can, and will. www.facebook.com/CountryPlaceCafe233 Douglas DriveBrooklyn, WI 53521     (608) 455-1115",4014,0.2016806311967602,0.5691786528883304

Usually it's for the lake perch at the Villa Tap or the bluegill at Dexter's but this week I was on the search for smelt. I think it probably had something to do with getting shutout at the NBSC's last Smelt Fry of 2018, but whatever the case was I was on a mission. I knew 5100 had smelt every Friday and since I couldn't remember exactly what it was like, and we hadn't been in what seemed like forever, it felt like fate wanted us to take the trip to McFarland...and so we did. Now, smelt are small which is why when you see them out there it's often at an AYCE affair. 5100's weekly special only runs $12, and as you might have guessed, isn't AYCE for that price. The plate comes dotted with 12 or so of the teeny fish and each is encased in a thick and crunchy batter (at least it was thick for melt). They were really more like smelt fries (think French fry style) and I assume pre-battered (it just had that look and feel). Conversely, the cod (which my son got) had a light, flaky, peppery breading that was very appealing. Had the smelt come with that same coating it could have been superb, but as it was is was just so-so. A modicum of the smelty flavor did permeate the dense batter, but all in all they were simply overwhelmed.Whereas the smelt suffered the hash browns with cheese and onion ($1.00 up-charge for the C&O) were superb. These spuds were slick and gooey, and lavishly loaded with cheese. The stringy cheddar leaked into every crack and crevice of the crisped shreds and made for a satisfying experience. Some thick tartar also did the deed and actually blended pretty well with the beefy batter on the smelt...of course it also crushed on the cod, so take that for what it's worth. A nice little sphere of white bread with a crisp bottom was a step about the norm, while some super sloppy looking slaw had a fine flavor but was pretty middle of the road and certainly not much to look at. 5100 has been in the game for a while now and while we've never had a bad meal there, we've never been blown away either. That said, I don't remember the cod being nearly this tasty and I'm going to make it a point to come back soon to give it a real shot. The smelt on the other hand...we'll skip.

Even though the place is brand new, 5100 is already on top of their frying game. Our food came in no time and was piping hot all around. The large plate was loaded with upwards of 15 smelt and several scrumptious sides. The smelt was a little fishy tasting (as youd expect), but any strong flavors were muted by a light, golden breading. The books were beheaded, betailed(?), split down the belly, and flipped open along the spine making for perfect little tartar canoes. They were fried firm and had a nice taste, although a little more seasoning in the almost-too-thick breading would have made them even more delectable.

Like everything else with this Fish Fry, they are AYCE which is necessary when youre talking two more pieces of cod on Round 2. Truth be told, I only wanted one piece of cod and a couple shrimp, but the waitress said they were pre-portioned so it had to be two cod, three shrimp, or BOTH. Since I wasnt up for packing all that in I settled on the cod. It came even faster than the first round of fish and was smooth, creamy, and light. It had a very flavorful beer batter that was just the right thickness. Cod > Smelt (in this case). Highlighting both styles of fish was 5100s tartar which was thick and creamy, but was laced with dill and capers. While the blend was still zesty, and didnt totally turn me off totally, I could do with less of both of those things. That said, the punch it provided actually helped the smelt along somewhat, so take that for what its worth. Also AYCE, and also delicious, was the homemade coleslaw. The sweet and zippy slaw was downright delightful, and had just the right consistency. A little round roll with a brilliant crust tagged along with the fish and was far better than your average bun. While AYCE Fish Frys are going the way of the Dodo, 5100 is doing what they can to save the species.

Then it was Crandalls Con Safos. Now it is 5100, and while I never went to the PP or the infamous Latin dance club, I assume 5100 is better than either one of them ever was. 5100 features fish for both lunch and dinner on Fridays, with the later having an All You Can Eat option for $13. Since we came for lunch the only choice was the regular $10 cod, which was more than enough for a lunch or dinner appetite. Showing top form, 5100 brought the fish quickly and it was piping hot. I, of course, dove right in, burning the roof of my mouth in the process. The cod was simply large and in charge. For ten bucks you are treated to four big pieces which are at least 3, if not 4 oz each. The studly loins are paired with a flavorful beer batter that is on the dark side color-wise, but was not burned or anything like that. It was surprisingly light even though it looked intimidating and had a couple batter floaties attached to the side. The cod itself was flaky, but did meld together a little (Avenue Bar-style) which wasnt necessarily a bad thing. It was a very rich fish, and Im not sure I could even have eaten any more. A bunch of thick Julienne-cut fries intermingled with the fish, and were hearty, but not superb. While there was nothing glaring wrong them, they just werent as good as some Ive had. They are also the only option with the Friday lunch special, so if you dont like it, tough cookies. The tartar had a bit of an odd twinge, and was also just so-so. It was homemade and appeared to have some capers in it (which could explain the twinge). In addition, the portion was on the small side and didnt quite last through the four large pieces of cod. The AYCE dinners would certainly necessitate a backup or two. The dinner special comes with a dinner roll, but the lunch Fry was a breadless affair. A nice homemade slaw was provided though, and was fresh and a little sweet. It was certainly above average although the portion was on the small side when compared to everything else. 5100 is a nice place. It is spacious yet inviting, and offers good food with a wait staff to match. Overall, this Fish Fry is borderline highly recommendable, and well definitely be back in the not too distant future. www.5100bar.com5100 Erling AvenueMcFarland, WI 53558     (608) 223-5100",2334,0.07639050858438615,0.5158713961775185

Bunkys is best known of their Mediterranean fare which includes Italian favorites like lasagna and ravioli, as well as other regional favorites like hummus, tabouli, and baba ghanouj. So you might be surprised to learn that not only does Bunkys have a cod Fish Fry all day on Fridays, but also features walleye, tilapia, shrimp and salmon. Over the course of three visits weve sampled the cod and the walleye and found both of them to be decent, but far from the best.The cod is modestly priced at $9.00 and the 6 ounces you get are reasonably satisfying. The walleye is a bit of a different story and while the portion is only slightly larger, at seven ounces, the price tag nearly doubles to $15, which is a bit steep all thing considered. Six ounces equates to three small pieces of cod, each of which is coated in a medium-thick breading. This extra girth enables the breading to hold together well, and stay fully attached to its host. In addition to its clinginess it also has a decent amount of seasoning which perks up the plain fish a bit. The walleye shares the same breading but since it has more inherent flavor any seasoning in the breading is almost indiscernible. Like the cod, the walleye had some flake to it, but was slightly mushy thanks to the few minutes it spent in transit (Bunkys specializes in carryout if you didnt know). The highlight of Bunkys Fish Fry has to be house-cut fries which are plentiful and ultra-delicious. While they lost some heat on the drive they were still superb. They are clearly cut onsite, expertly fried, and salted to the sweet spot. If every place would just make French fries like this the world would be a happier place.Bunkys tartar is also impressive, and the thick, creamy blend effectively covers any imperfections in the fish (of which the cod and walleye both had a few). Like most good tartars it is made mostly of mayo, and has just enough relish to let you know its there. Keeping with the homemade theme is Bunkys coleslaw which looks scrumptious and tastes okay, but really needs a little more oomph. That said, it has a very good consistency and while there is a little slaw water at the left at the bottom of the cup the cabbage concoction isnt swimming in it. Bunkys Deli historically specialized in carryout, but on the last of our three visits they had annexed the space next door and opened up a dedicated dining space (which we will certainly be taking advantage of on any subsequent visits). Fish is just better when its freshly fried and even a few minutes sweating in a bag can really take a toll on it. Overall, we recommend the cod, but the walleye is a little tougher to fully endorse. At $15 it really isnt a good deal, and in the end you have to ask yourself if youd get it again at that price, and unfortunately $15 its a bit too expensive for what you get.  www.bunkyscafe.net/catering_and_deli.htm5440 Willow RdWaunakee, WI 53597     (608) 310-2221",3060,0.16565277777777776,0.4663928571428573

Rumor had it the new place would be a bit of a departure from the original, but would maintain several of the staple dishes that made them so popular. It didnt take us long to notice the Friday Fish Fry sign blowing in the breeze and see the rumors were true. Departed they had. Go we must.Since we hadnt been to the carryout locale we had no idea what was on the menu and figured wed just order there instead of calling ahead (they just opened, how busy could they be, right?). It turned out they were plenty busy and calling ahead would have saved us about 30 minutes (a feature we will certainly be taking advantage of next time thanks to the menus we took with us this time). The only fish on special is cod with a single to-go order going for $8, so thats what I got. It took quite a while to get the food, and my fish was ready slightly before my wifes Mediterranean Platter (or whatever it was that she got). We raced home, getting the fish there in fairly good condition although some grease had settled. The 3-pieces of cod present in the container amounted to around 6 ounces, which is on the smallish side as far as Fish Fry portions are concerned. The fish itself was flaky and pure, and accompanied by a flavorful batter that was very light and overcame the tiny bit of grease with ease. Overall, it had a really nice flavor, but portion was so tiny it was gone in a flash. Like the fish, the wedge fries were also few and far between. While each one was hefty, there were literally 5 of them which appeared to equate to one potato worth. They were impressively cooked, and very well-seasoned, but I just wanted, no NEEDED, more of them. I didnt really expect it, but of all things Bunkys took tartar sauce to the next level. The homemade mix was simply superb. It was thick and creamy, and very unique. It was deeeeelicious and some of the best I can remember eating anywhere. Ever. Rounding out the meal was some homemade slaw that was right over the fat part of the plate - nothing superb, but fresh and inviting. I ate every scrap of it, since the portions everywhere else were underwhelming, and there was no bread at all to back it up. Seriously, not even a piece o pita or somethin.  The Fish Fry portions were definitely on the small side (and we accidentally got charged for two of them instead of one), but the Mediterranean Platter was plentiful, except for the pita bread of which there were only two. Next time well be asking for more, or adding a side order, or whatever it is we need to do get some, because that pocket bread is tasty (and necessary). Overall, we barely recommend this Fish Fry since everything tasted great, but was hard to come by. Next time we visit, well be sure to phone ahead, ask for a jumbo order of fish (with bread), and count our change before we go. www.bunkyscafe.net/catering_and_deli.htm5440 Willow RdWaunakee, WI 53597     (608) 310-2221",3310,0.22949861336580088,0.4784514790764791

The road to Fish Fry is similar, and while we usually get where we need to go, we dont always get there in pristine condition. Some fryers know how to navigate these gnarly roads and reduce the wear and tear, but others dont have the skills needed and seem to hit every little dip along the way. You could say our ride at the new Luckys in Waunakee was a bumpy one.Right away I knew we were in trouble as we got seated in the Stadium Section which was basically a big section walled-off from the main dining room. While it wasnt a horrible space, we were one of the first groups in the tacked-on feeling area, and the lone waitress patrolling these grounds was nowhere to be found. Eventually she showed up (a good 10 minutes after we sat down), and we gave her our orders for food and drinks since wed had ample time to peruse both menus while we waited. Fittingly, it took a disproportionate amount of time for her to return with our libations, during which one of the other parties which had joined us in the Stadium actually got up and left. It was a rocky start for sure, but sometimes once you get out of first gear things smooth out. Unfortunately for Luckys the hiccups just kept coming. Not long after the drinks arrived the food showed up (kudos to the kitchen). Since I was starving I plowed into the plate with reckless abandon and was happy with some parts, but disappointed with others. I first tried a French fry and they were lukewarm at best. The limp spuds were heavily-seasoned and showed promise, but suffered from too much time spent out of the oil. Ba-bump. Thankfully, the fish was adequately heated and was surprisingly flavorful. The cod sported a dark beer batter which initially had me worried. It looked burned, and while it did have some over-fried batter cling-ons they were in a small minority and were easily brushed aside. The beer batter actually had a very nice flavor which was a little smoky, but not charred tasting or anything like that. The fish itself was clean and greaseless, but since it wasnt scalding hot when it arrived it got mildly mushy. Baby bump. Playing the role of Teller to the fishs Penn was a plain-Jane tartar sauce which appeared to be house-made. While, like Teller, it made its partner more palatable, it was almost pure mayo and uninteresting. It did cover some of the imperfections in the fish, but a bump up in the relish department would actually have made this ride a lot smoother. No bread. BUUUUMP! Perhaps the most perplexing part of the evening was the slaw situation. While the slaw served with the Fish Fry was very good, a totally different version came with my wifes veggie burger. The Fry slaw was a traditional creamy blend with crispy and distinctive taste, while the red cabbage slaw that came with the burger was even more unique and perhaps even tastier. Why two different slaws? We may never know, but both were excellent and had us wishing the everything else was more like the slaw. Oddity bump? For some reason I was expecting a smoother ride from Lukcys than the one we got (even though our previous experiences at their downtown location were also bumpy). Overall, I dont recommend this Fish Fry, and wont come back until they have ironed out the wrinkles. www.luckysbarandgrille.com/waunakee/1008 Quinn DrWaunakee, WI 53597     (608) 850-5825",3427,0.15120047593731809,0.4407132730816943

Unfortunately, most of the stuff in the rough is there for a reason, especially when it comes to Fish Frys. At this point, I feel like Ive heard of almost every bar in the greater Madison area (specifically those with fish), but for some reason Id never heard of Crapps Tap in McFarland. When I realized Crapps had a Fish Fry special the thought of those elusive diamonds crossed my mind. The $6.95 3-piece comes with all the standard trimmings, although all of them turned out to be substandard. Since our small group was the first of the day to order food we got it in no time. The fish came pre-battered, straight from a big Ziplock bag, and was extremely mediocre. The pieces were practically perfect parallelograms with a Glass Nickel-like look and flavor. It had a thick, crunchy batter which served only as a cover for the mushy fish underneath. While it didnt taste terrible per se, any fish that can be tessellated simply isnt for me, and while Ive always been a fan of Geometry, Id appreciate it if the trapezoids were confined to text books and not on my dinner plate. The fries were the standard crinkle-cut freezer-to-fryer jobs, which are usually acceptable, except when served in a portion this small. Our baskets contained a mere half a handful each, and they were a little under-fried to boot. The tartar was your standard food service sauce, but is actually really tasty and houses a potent relish pop that covers up boring fish, and douses dull fries. So, sorta score one for the tartar?The roll was stale and uninviting which paired it (un)perfectly with the coleslaw. The loathsome slaw was zesty (but not in a good way) and a little bit snotty looking. Blech. It turns out there was a reason why Id never heard of the Fish Fry at Crapps  because no one in their right mind would ever recommend it. Overall, I dont recommend it either, and unfortunately, like most stuff in the rough, this Fish Fry is there for a reason  its kinda crappy. www.crappstap.com5915 Exchange StreetMcFarland, WI 53558     (608) 838-6012",2110,-0.047117794486215545,0.49182330827067655

Sure, a family restaurant, a brew pub, or even a diner might work their way into the mix, but for the most part it's our locally-owned taverns and clubs that shine. Rarely do fine dining establishments enter the conversation, as it seems like a crowd they could do without for the most part, but once in a while a place like the Tempest sneaks in there. They also have a kick-ass happy hour, so take that for what it's worth...The Tempest is definitely a fine dining establishment since things like fresh oysters and swanky fish preparations are their specialty, but that doesn't mean they are just paying lip service to the Fish Fry. They does things right with both lake perch ($18) AND bluegill ($16) gracing their Friday menu, and the lake perch perpetration can be described as nothing less than beautiful. It's literally about as pretty as a Fish Fry gets with five fat fillets of real yellow perch gracing the plate with their crumbly breading, and near-perfect flavor. Of course, there is no grease at all on these loins, and our only regret about them was running out before we could get enough. Few places, even supper club and taverns, do house-cut fries, but the Tempest has no problem with that demand. Theirs come in droves and serve as a type of straw bed for the festooned fish. Unfortunately, this Friday, the spuds were not fryer fresh, but the taste was still there despite some latent crispiness. In all fairness we've gotta dock them a point for the lukewarmness, but in general these things are excellent. Whereas the perch and (normally) the fries knock it out of the park, the tartar was a bit of a miss. While it was house-made for sure, it was a bit on the dilly side. It certainly didn't really make the fish any better, which is the hallmark of any good sauce. Definitely a strike out for the Oyster Bar...as they say, you can't win 'em all. Before any of the preceding occurred, a nice basket of crusty sourdough graced our table and made us all happy. In addition, waaaaaaay too much fresh slaw for one person the eat came along with the fish with the bevy of rainbow shreds being far too raw tasting. A bit more creaminess might have boosted the blend but even I sent at least half of the massive scoop back. It was a monster. The Tempest isn't your average Fish Fry joint, but that shouldn't keep you from thinking about them when Friday rolls around. Taverns are tremendous, and supper clubs make us smile, but fine dining can be just fine as well.

Well, there has recently been a Fish Fry resurgence in downtown Madison, and the Tempest is one of the places now taking the Friday tradition seriously. Weve taken notice and have paid them three separate visits in order to see how serious they really are. Turns out theyre pretty damn serious.The Tempest will take your reservation on Friday (unlike a lot of places), and they were ready to seat us the moment we walked in the door. On our previous visits they were featuring lake perch and walleye, but this Friday they threw us a curve a bluegill ball. Even though Id already had bluegill earlier in the day, I wasnt going to complain about it, and stepped to the plate with my fish face on. Prior to the entrées the Tempest trots out a basket of their scrumptious house bread. The sublime slices were sweet and doughy and simply delicious. They paired elegantly with the Tempests relish tray which is a work of art both in appearance and palatability. Pink pickled eggs, radishes with chèvre, pickled green beans, and a pair of olives were artfully placed below a couple green onion tubes which nicely set the stage for the engaging fish that was to come. The big plate of delicious fish arrived on the heels of the relish tray and was (as expected) masterfully crafted. It featured seven tiny bluegill fillets which were pure and smooth. While the breading could have used a hint more seasoning it allowed the bluegill essence to shine through which made me happy. The fish sat atop a mountain of house-cut fries which were thicker than expected, but as superb as anticipated. You might not expect an oyster house to know their way around the deep fryer, but these spuds were well-fried, and maybe more importantly, plentiful. I love the taste of real fries, and this troop clearly was. The tartar was also obviously homemade, but unlike the fries wasnt stellar. It wasnt bad per se, but was on the thin side and had a little more of a dilly flavor than Id like to see/taste. That said, it wasnt overpowering or anything like that so I still used it sparingly. A super stringy slaw formed a daunting blockade on the left side of the plate and while it tasted fine, it was hard to handle. It was diverse, but cut too long and thin and not zesty enough for my tastes.After becoming accustomed to the greatness at the Tempest I will say that this particular Fish Fry was a slight regression. While it was still really good, I wouldnt put it in Top 25 territory like some of our previous visits. The bluegill was tasty, but not as expertly done as the perch weve had in the past while everything else just kind of maintained the status quo. Overall, we still highly recommend this Fish Fry, but hope a reprise of the perch on our next visit. www.tempestoyster.com120 E Wilson StMadison, WI 53703     (608) 258-1443",3024,0.16969128329297822,0.5221468926553673

Taking it to the next level. Pushing the envelope. Sometimes you want something fancier, something you know is of the highest quality, even if that quality is reflected in the price. While these occasions usually dont fall on Fridays, once in a while they do, and we are powerless to resist them.Truth be told, I really just had a hankerin fer some perch, and since I wanted to follow-up on our previous exquisite visit to the Tempest it just made sense. We arrived fairly early, but Happy Hour was happening and the place was seriously slammed. We had a brief wait, which I spent trying to obtain a beverage from the boisterous bar, and no sooner had I actually acquired it than a table opened up for us. We were in like Flynn! While the wait for our non-reserved table was on the short side, the wait for our mustachioed waiter was a bit the opposite. It took a few minutes before we even saw him, and a couple more before he graced us with his presence.  Luckily, he was charming and friendly, and made the nearly two and a half hours which were to follow very bearable. Oh yeah, and that mustache was a handlebar, and it was totally kick-ass. Last time around the Tempest only had lake perch on special, but this Friday a $16 walleye joined the fold. While I was tempted to try the well-described walleye, I stuck to my guns and pulled the trigger on the perch. As our order went in I tipped back in my chair, took a pull of my $2 bottle of Schlitz and awaited my destiny. Before long a basket of sourdough slices showed up, along with a little sweetened butter. The duo was velvety smooth and delicious, and we easily went through the whole basket between the two of us. When our food didnt show up shortly after, another basket was requested (along with another Schlitz). As was the theme of the night, it took a little longer than youd expect to get this round, but even so it wasnt necessarily a bad thing. While it was slow, the crowd was enjoyable, and the time passed quickly. Probably 45 minutes after our order went in we finally had our food, but as expected it looked immaculate. Everything sat atop a triangle of brown butcher paper, which added an artful flair (artful for a Fish Fry at least). From the huge pile of coleslaw, to the seven robust perch fillets, to a handful of house-cut fries, and a ramekin of tartar, everything was clearly made with care (no wonder it took so long). The fish was simply superb, and the fillets varied in size from large to small (so you know theyre legit). Despite the difference in mass they were unified by a well-seasoned, crumbly breading that complimented the sweet swimmers perfectly. They were golden on the plate and in the belly, and didnt upset my Schlitz-load of beers one bit. I left feeling goooooood. Following the fish was a school of house-cut fries which were limp, but lively. While they were a little on the dark side, they were tasty, and well executed (for a fancy-schmancy seafood place someone in the kitchen at the Tempest knows their way around the deep fryer). The tartar also was tasty, albeit on the thin side. Even so, the perched liked it, but didnt need to rely on it to be great. The huge scoop of slaw was also made fresh, and had a nice sweetness that added something to the meal that wouldnt have been there otherwise. When it comes right down to it $16 isnt really that outrageous of a price to pay for a Fish Fry of this quality (plus the $2 Schlitz helps keep the alcohol bill in check). I mean lets face it, the cost of fish is rising, and even the dive bars are having to charge $14-$15 dollars for a plate of perch. Considering the little extras you get at the Tempest its definitely worth a splurge once in a while. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and had lotsa fun, even if it did take lotsa time.  www.tempestoyster.com120 E Wilson StMadison, WI 53703     (608) 258-1443",3945,0.11125045695045695,0.49625026455026455

The Tempest!? Cmon Thats a ritzy foo-foo downtown oyster house. They cant possibly have a good Fish Fry, and even if they do I bet it costs a fortune! How dare you recommend them so highly? You make me sick While I will concede that the price of the Friday Fish Fry at the Tempest Oyster House is on the high end, after this visit Id have to say that its so good its worth every one of your 1600 stinkin pennies. While $16 is a hefty price tag for a Fish Fry, the Tempest Oyster Bar goes the extra mile to make it worth your while. It all starts with a big basket of fresh sourdough, and a sparse, but enticing relish tray. The delightful dough was crusty and chewy - a very nice option when compared to your standard dinner roll. The relish tray was a modern take on the classic, and featured: four pickled green beans, a few slices of radish with some sort of creamy spread on them, a couple pickled olives, one green onion, and one pink hardboiled egg sliced in half. While it was a crazy looking conglomeration, every single item was tasty, and totally worked. There were so many great little flavors it is impossible to describe them all, but they were all delicious. Needless to say, they did what they were supposed to and I was well primed for some fish. They say you never get a second chance to make a first impression, and this plate instantly went down in history as one of the nicest Ill ever see. While the food itself looked stunning, it was presented artfully atop a diagonally-folded napkin, which not only looked classy, but soaked up any little dabs of grease. While it almost pained me to break up the idyllic scene, it would have pained me even more not to dig into the amazing feast in front of me. I started, as I so often do, with the fish. The Tempest always knows where their fish comes from, and the Lake Superior lake perch was no exception. The five fat fillets featured were fresh and meaty, and paired with a flavorful breading that complemented them well. The light breading clung to the moist fish with herculean effort, and while it wasnt ultra-thin, it didnt inhibit the flavor of the fish one bit. It was truly fantastic, and some of the best Ive had.Also on the napkin were a generous portion of the Tempests skin-on, house-cut fries. The spuds were fresh and delicious, and the kind of fry that makes you wonder why cant ever place just do it like this? They were literally almost perfect. Wrapping up this fantastic Fry were two more of the Tempests homemade goodies. The first was the tartar, which was clearly made in-house, but just wasnt quite right. While it had some zest, it was on the thin side, and didnt really improve the fish (this may speak more to the deliciousness of the fish than any shortcomings in the sauce however  the fish simply didnt need it). The second was the slaw which was also fresh and made in house. Like its cohorts it was placed loving on the napkin which kept its creamy substrate from leaking towards its fried friends. Smart and satisfying.While I expected the Tempest to put out a decent Fish Fry, I never expected theyd put the amount of care and effort into it that they do. Their commitment to craftsmanship is evident as they are not merely slinging perch, but making a fine dining Fish Fry experience. Overall, we highly recommend the Friday Fish Fry at the Tempest, and think the $16 price tag is actually quite justified. It was just amazing all around, and I can hardly wait to come back for another round. www.tempestoyster.com120 E Wilson StMadison, WI 53703     (608) 258-1443",3621,0.2051806599832916,0.5371626984126981

The once seemingly ubiquitous chain has waned in popularity over the years, and many of the small town locations have closed up shop (including the one in our hometown). In some cases theyve re-opened, but under a new name and with (hopefully) better food. The Country Cafe in Sun Prairie is just such a place. The Country Cafe is popular with the locals and the place was buzzing when I showed up at 11:45 this Friday. The kitchen was running like a well-oiled Fish Fry machine and orders were flying out as fast as they were coming in. Despite the rush there were some spots at the counter so I scooped one up and had my order in within a few minutes. While I was lured by the lake perch, and almost sucked in by the smelt, I stuck with the $8.85 cod that I intended on getting before noticing the other two fish were on special. Before the main course arrived, some homemade coleslaw started things off. It was creamy and featured a slight zip with a little kiss of sweetness. It was tasty, but wasnt quite a throat tickler.The cod came quickly thereafter - the Fish Fry machine clearly in full swing. This machine kicks out your standard 3-piece beer battered cod, complete with a moderately thick batter, and plenty of grease. Despite my repeated rotating, some of the misplaced oil still settled into the beer-infused coating, but not badly enough to ruin it. The fish itself was flaky, and remarkably didnt get mushy. By and large it was good, but the grease was a stumbling block. The Friday special comes with your choice of any two sides and I stayed the traditional course, opting for the hash browns with cheese and onion, and coleslaw. The potatoes I picked were the classic diner variety, and came in a massive pile. The lone slice of American cheese that topped them wasnt quite up to the job, and with the ample onion present I hardly even noticed it was there. I also saw plenty of fries coming through the window while I waited, and they appeared to be the standard Sysco Julienne-cut. Capping off the creamy cod was an equally creamy tartar sauce. It was the thick variety, and had just the right amount of relish. Like the fries, I wouldnt be surprised if it was Sysco, and like the fries it wouldnt bother me if it was. A rich and doughy piece of white bread put the finishing touch on this Fish Fry. It tasted fresh and had a notable elasticity which I really enjoyed. +1. Ive been hearing for a while that this is a pretty good Fish Fry and Id have to agree that it is just that  good - nothing more, nothing less. Overall, I recommend this Fish Fry, and would have no problem coming back for it if I was in the area. Sure, its far from the best of the best, but its also far from the worst of the worst, and a good deal at under nine bucks. countrycafesunprairie.com/1030 Emerald TerraceSun Prairie, WI 53590     (608) 837-5191",2927,0.16236519328624585,0.48071188071188076

The fish was hit and miss, lacking the consistency that is the hallmark of the best of the best. One week it was pert near perfect, and the next something was off. This cycle seemingly repeated itself ad nauseam until we just decided to take an  leave of absence from it altogether. Eventually five years or so passed and we figured it was time to see if they'd finally settled into their groove...and it seems they have.G&B still has cod and bluegill every Friday, that much has never changed, but the preparation and the price have apparently stabilized. The cod sits at a princely $16 for a 3-piece, with additional pieces available for a hefty $4 each. Yes, that is a premium price, but in all fairness, it does seem to be a premium product. This cod is velvety and smooth with a decadent beer batter to match. The enticing coating isn't too thick, but isn't waifishly thin either. What's more, the fish is fried right, such that nary a hint of grease clings to the loins. It's grade-A stuff for sure, but man, it'll cost ya. Partnering with the flaky fish are a bevy of matchstick fries, which are fine, but nothing over the top. Their sheer numbers made a nice resting spot for the four fat loins, but other than that were fairly standard. Two kinds of sauces attempted to keep thing fresh although they didn't seem to vary much. Both were thin and very tartar-like, to the point where I thought maybe I just got two of the same thing? Sure, I used them all, but if you put any sauce on the plate I'm probably gonna eat eat and that includes the homemade ketchup was incredibly pungent and vinegar-forward. A sweet homemade slaw was a welcome addition to the pricey plate and I'd definitely like to get my lips on it again. The bread on the other hand was absent so there's so I can't eat that again if I would want to or not. Finding the Friday night groove isn't the easiest of tasks for a lot of places, but it seems Gates & Brovi has done it, just at an exorbitant price point. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and will probably stop by again if we are in the area and feel like going all out. Oh, and did I mention, they are one of the more kid-friendly places in town? So that's a huge feather in their cap, and well worth our extra $10... gatesandbrovi.com3502 Monroe StreetMadison, WI 53711     (608) 819-8988",2498,0.2446047323888233,0.4783541584677948

George wants to like pesto. He has to like pesto. But every time he gets pesto he just cant seem to like it even though he presumes everyone else does. I want to like Gates & Brovi, and in fact I do like a lot of things about Gates & Brovi, but I really want to love Gates & Brovi and just dont.What I do like about Gates & Brovi: the bartenders and the drinks they make are great, the place is exceptionally kid friendly, and they have lots of options for vegetarians. That checks a lot of boxes on my list, but unfortunately the boxes that dont get checked are the most important boxes of all. G&B has cod and bluegill on Friday nights and Ive sampled both of them over the last year or so. The bluegill goes for $15.00 and is well done, but could be better. 4.5 ounces of fish makes up the portion with fillets varying in size from super tiny, to massively meaty. Its clearly some high quality fish with an alluring musk, but the crunchy breading lacks the seasoning to really offset it. On our first visit the seasoning was there and we absolutely loved it, but each subsequent visit the spice quotient has been dialed back and the resultant fish has been less and less appealing. Lots and lots of shoestring-style fries ride along with the fish and are good, but thats about all I can really say about them. The house tartar can barely even be labeled as such, as it is very thin and doesnt have much zip. It is kind of like ranch dressing and kind of like sour cream, which makes is kind of not like tartar. No bread comes with the $15.00 fish which is a bummer plain and simple. A healthy feeling slaw sort of makes up for it with a uniquely sweet and crispy flavor, but it can really only do so much. Gates & Brovi is so close to greatness its almost maddening that they dont quite get there. They have so much going for them that we want and expect them to be better than they actually are. Its a unique establishment that has a modern menu and a great vibe, but still welcomes the whole family. There simply arent many place like it and we could see it becoming a go-to if only their food delivered a little more.

Maybe its because people are tired from all the shopping, or are just too zoned in on turkey, but whatever the reason its generally a slow one. On both of our previous visits to Gates & Brovi there was a sizeable crowd and a decent wait so we were relieved when we showed up on Black Friday and saw the Please Seat Yourself sign when we walked in the door. We took one of the booths along the near-wall, and had waters and menus in front of us in no time.G&B usually has cod and bluegill on Fridays, but this week they also had unique preparation of walleye available. While I was somewhat tempted by the walleye, Im not really into uniqueness where Fish Fry is concerned so I stuck with the bluegill. As you might expect, the food came extremely quickly since it wasnt very busy at the Monroe Street restaurant, and definitely looked the part. Since it didnt have a second to sit the bluegill was steaming hot when I got my hands on it. The last time I had the bluegill it was extra salty and extra delicious, but this time around the sodium quotient was dialed down significantly. While the fish was still moist and flaky, the lack of seasoning in the breading made it far less exciting. Im not sure if there was a different cook, or maybe the regular guy was just trying to show some restraint with the salt shaker, but whatever it was the nine small fillets left me wanting some more flavor. The French fries followed a similar trajectory to the fish and were missing the saltiness weve become accustomed to. Thankfully, there was plenty in the shaker at the table and I was able to douse the golden shoestrings into respectability. Homemade tartar sauce can be a beautiful thing or it can be fruitless endeavor. Striking the perfect balance of sassiness and creaminess can be elusive, and Gates & Brovi certainly didnt find it tonight. This rendition was clearly homemade and tasted fine, but was incredibly thin with a consistency similar to that of ranch dressing. While there were plenty of real pickle shreds in it they didnt drive the sauce home, or really anywhere for that matter. If there is one thing weve come to expect from Gates & Brovi its killer coleslaw. On both of our previous visits the coleslaw shined, and if it wouldnt have been for the well-seasoned fish the sassy slaw would stole the show completely. This time around it was still fresh and lively, but nowhere near as zippy and intriguing. And, of course, there is still no bread served with any of the fish which is disappointing to say the least. All in all this was still a good trip to Gates & Brovi, but there were a few more misses than hits this time around. The fish was under-seasoned (at least compared to what we were expecting), the tartar was a bit too thin, the slaw lacked zest, and of course there was no bread whatsoever. Overall, we still recommend this Fish Fry, and this visit wont totally preclude us from coming back, but I might think twice before we take the drive all the way down Monroe again. gatesandbrovi.com3502 Monroe StreetMadison, WI 53711     (608) 819-8988",3198,0.08364346411965458,0.463571719286005

You could call it reservation. Or you could just call it a straight-up desire to not go back. But whatever you call it Im glad we put it out of our minds. We were burned by Gates & Brovi once, and not very impressed on a second visit, but something told us there was more in store so we put our fears aside and gave them a third opportunity to prove themselves. Im sure glad we did. The third time was finally the charm we were waiting for.Showing up anywhere at 6:30 on Friday night is a bit of a crapshoot, but we didnt have much choice this week. Even though there was plenty of parking on Monroe G&B was packed. We got a spot on the chalkboard list, and lucked into a couple open stools at the bar. The mutton-chopped bartender noticed our arrival and had drinks for us before you could say nice beard, buddy. As predicted by the host we had a table in about 30 minutes, and sat down ready to chow. On our previous forays into the Gates & Brovi Fry cod was the only fish on the menu, but they recently added bluegill to the Friday offering which actually gave me a decision to make (although it was a pretty easy one since the cod was just so-so last time). The bluegill took a good 15 minutes or so to fry, but it was scalding hot when it arrived and boy did it look impressive. There were nine fillets in total and each was simply marvelous. They were lightly coated in with a beautiful breading that enhanced the fish without overpowering it. It was an amazing balancing act, as the fish remained moist and supple with no rubbery textures or fishy flavors. It was literally almost perfect and pretty much took my breath away. The glorious gill was ideally offset by G&Bs McDonalds-style French fries which were salty and delicious. There were easily enough of them to go blow for blow with the fish, but I was also fortunate enough to land a few more when my wife couldnt finish her small side of them (a whole basket full for $2.50). Score! Not everything in life is perfect and the tartar in this Fish Fry proved that point. It was ample, but on the thin side as far as tartar is concerned. That said, it had a great zip, and my big paper cup was totally drained by the end. Usually I consider the slaw supplementary to the fish, but this slaw was a showstopper on its own. It was fresh and crispy, had a perfect harmony of flavors, and was clearly homemade (nothing this good comes in a jar). It had to be some of, if not the, best in the whole city. You can take that to the bank. With so much great stuff going on with this Fish Fry I was a little dismayed that there was no bread served with it. Had there been you would easily be talking Top 25 territory. It was just that good, just not that complete. This was the Fish Fry I was hoping for the first time we stepped foot into Gates & Brovi, but alas it just wasnt meant to be at that point in time. Im glad we gave them a couple more cracks at it because they finally figured it all out. It really is a great little place and as kid-friendly as it gets for all you moms and dads out there who are hesitant to take the little ones out on Friday nights. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and cant wait to go back, which certainly isnt the tune we were singing after our previous visits. gatesandbrovi.com3502 Monroe StreetMadison, WI 53711     (608) 819-8988",3375,0.27789930809930813,0.5818902726902726

To our dismay they were sold out their Friday Fish Fry by 9pm, which resulted in a couple drinks getting slammed and a quick trip to the Tipsy Cow instead. Since we still wanted to try the G&B Fry we decided to give them a second chance, and made sure to show up earlier this time around. Gates & Brovi is new and stylish, and surprisingly spacious. Even though we showed up during the peak rush we had no problem getting a table, which spoke to both the speedy service as well as the overall size of the establishment. Our waitress had a round of drinks ready for us within a few minutes, and within 20 more we had our food. While cod is the only fish option available, it does come in a couple different sizes  a $9 2-piece, or a $12 3-piece (you can also add another piece for three more bucks). The size of the 3-piece was adequate, but not necessarily abundant. The fish was somewhat limp upon arrival, and not scalding hot. In addition, there was a noticeable amount of grease oozing forth which didnt ruin its succulence, but did make it harder to handle. The grease saturated the beer batter in places which sort of caused it to meld with the fish into a single creamy unit. The rich batter was medium-thick, but really tasty, and although the fish pretty much fell apart in tartar it was still very appealing. Speaking of the sauce, this tartar tasted fine, but was super thin, and dominated by relish. While it wasnt bad in any way, it didnt bolster the fish whatsoever either. Wed much prefer a creamy mayo sauce, and think it would work better with their decadent fish than this thin mix does. If youre a fan of French fries, you know exactly what McDonalds has to offer (and you no doubt really like them). The G&B fries mimicked McDonalds through and through, and were fried identically. It was basically as if someone said, Micky Ds has the best fries around, lets just copy those and while Id say house-cut fries are vastly superior, Mickys Ds does make some tasty fries. Polishing off the plate was some homemade coleslaw that was simply off the charts. It was sweet, and zippy, and while some of sauce settled on the bottom of the cup it was easily re-mixed and well worth every second spent stirring. Yum.For some reason G&B doesnt include any kind of bread with their fish which not only makes it less satisfying, but less traditional as well. -1. To be honest, we have to say that we were expecting a little more from the Fish Fry at Gates & Brovi. Yes, everything was good, but nothing really stood out, and while I would probably try it again it would be with some reservations. Overall, we still recommend this Fish Fry, but think they have some work to do if they want to swim with the big fish. gatesandbrovi.com3502 Monroe StreetMadison, WI 53711     (608) 819-8988",2887,0.15944787739142574,0.47846553088488575

For one reason or another we were never able to make it up that way before they unexpectedly closed up shop, but it wasnt long before a new place called the Spring Creek Tavern took over the Main Street space, and again, seemed to be thriving. We had a couple great Fish Frys at the SCT in their heyday, so we were surprised when they too suddenly closed their doors. Eventually we learned that the recipes used to make the delicious Creek-side fish were passed on to KDs Bar & Grill just up the road, and we wasted no time verifying that claim. The rumors were true and the cod at KDs was admirable, just as it had been at the SCT. We thought for sure that the fish had finally found a home, but wouldnt you know it, Willies is up to his old tricks again, this time with a Wet Spot all his own. I bellied up to Wet Spot one Friday and luckily caught the bartenders eye in no time. I got a Cow, the scoop on the Friday Fish (2-piece cod  $9.00, 3 piece  $10.00, 4-piece  $11.00, no more perch or bluegill), and had an order in just like that. The food came quickly and was piping hot, just as you'd like it to be. The plate was fully loaded with all the Fish Fry staples and even had a bonus side of baked beans.Since I had some idea what to expect size-wise, and I was pretty hungry, I went full-bore with the 4-piece. It wound up being a plentiful portion, as each piece clocked in somewhere between three and four ounces, making for pert-near a pound of fish. They housed a light batter that lacked grease, but also lacked flavor. It was a bland bunch to say the least, and while the fish itself was light and flaky, it tasted a little watery. While I had no problem eating all four pieces there was nothing that really made me crave them except for the desire to satisfy my huge hunger. Aiding the conventional cod was Willie's tartar sauce which you'll find just hanging out in a big squeeze bottle on top of the bar. The extra-creamy blend was really zesty, and while I'd prefer a refrigerated rendition, the room-temp tartar improved the fish dramatically. In fact, I probably wouldnt have been able to eat all four pieces if not for the snappy sauce. The pile of fries on the side appeared to be the standard Sysco fare, and were a little tough and crispy. They were overshadowed by a full slice of marble-rye which was soft and sour, and paired very nicely with a zesty coleslaw. The baked beans were also a nice addition, and although they were pretty basic it didn't make them any less desirable. While I'm not sure if KD's still has Willie's original recipes or not, I think there is a chance they might. The cod we had at the Wet Spot wasnt quite right, but perhaps Willie is just out of season when it comes to seasoning? I might see if he is worth his salt again one of these days. Overall, we still recommend the Fish Fry at the Wet Spot, but cant help but remember fonder times by the creek. www.facebook.com/WilliesRestaurantBar118 South Main St.Lodi, WI 53555     (608) 592-0332",3149,0.13786306947021232,0.5089317924139353

Not only will your friends like the fish, and the cheap 22 oz. tap beers, but youll like having them around while you wait for your table and believe me, you will wait. This place draws them in like few others.We met our friends Stan and Megan at the Stoughton hotspot around 6, but that didnt mean we were early by any means. The bar was already 2-deep and a 45 minute wait was quoted. A good hour/hour-fifteen later we finally had said table to go along with upwards of three of the big ol beers in our bellies. We were feeling fine, and ready to get our fry on. Our waitress was mildly flummoxed by the Friday night barrage, but toughed it out, never once losing her cool or her sense of humor. While she did forget a few things here and there, she handled it gracefully which made it easier to not to hold it against her. As you might expect, it took a while to get the fish once we ordered, but the time passed swiftly thanks in no small part to the abundant booze. When it did come, the cod was hot enough, but not scalding like youd like it to be. It was essentially the exact same Fish Fry I had on our last visit - two long pieces of lightly-battered cod, a smattering of house-cut fries, a small Solo cup of tartar, a huge bowl of slaw, and a football-shaped roll or two. While the fish is cut a little strangely, the taste is anything but odd. Good is a pretty weak way to describe anything (especially fish), but this stuff was basically just that - nothing really stood out, but there were no flaws to speak of either. The light beer batter complemented the flaky cod quite well, and while it was nothing fancy, there simply wasnt anything wrong with it. It just tasted good, and sometimes thats just enough. The house-cut fries were kind of a mixed bag, but were satisfying overall. The portion was decent, but could have been bigger, and there were a few too many over-fried nubs, but plenty of nice fat ones to balance it all out. Like the fries, the tartar was also a bit of a mixed bag. While it had enough zip, and paired well with the fish, it was a little too thin to cling, which drew several comments from around the table. The slaw was also noteworthy, but also not necessarily in a good way. It was easily some of the goopiest we have ever seen, and even though the sloppy mix tasted fine it definitely wasnt easy on the eyes. One of the items the waitress initially forgot were the rolls, but she sprung to action once we jogged her memory. The football-shaped starches pretty much fell in line with everything else in the Fish Fry and were good, but nothing more. BBG has Stoughton on lockdown at this point, and it certainly shows. The place is packed on Friday nights, and if you want to get a plate of their fish youd better be prepared to soak up a few suds at the bar (preferably with a good friend or two). Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry, but will definitely only come back when were prepared to stay awhile. www.banushis.com800 Nygaard StreetStoughton, WI 53589     (608) 873-3700",3110,0.12699239417989416,0.49937444885361565

This place is popular. I had no idea.The only idea I did have was that Banushis Bar and Grill was new to the Stoughton Fish Fry scene and thus was probably worth a shot  this turned out to be a gross miscalculation on my part. BBGs is a nice, new bar, the kind folks in towns like Stoughton really love. This (and presumably every) Friday, the place was just slammed, and I felt fortunate to even get a beer and some standing room near one of the two huge bars. It took a good 15-20 minutes of standing around the A bar before a big group was called from the B bar and I was able to gank a stool over there. Luckily, the B Bar still had a couple big TVs with the Brewers on one and the Blackhawks on the other so I settled right in. There were bartenders and wait staff buzzing all over the place, and my little corner of the world was no exception. I had my order for the $10.00 hand-dipped cod in within moments, and sat back for a second (or two) to enjoy the games. A couple seconds would turn out to be all I would have as a couple rolls and an overflowing bowl of slaw were slung my way. I started with the slaw and it was very good. It had the zest you want and and just the right consistency  not too runny but not dry either. It was contrasted nicely by the pair of soft, yet crusty football buns which were actually served warm (which is just such a nice little perk  one that really does make a difference). And of course, there were two of them for the one of me  a nice little perk in and of itself. There was a bit of a lull between the roll and slaw, and the fish which gave the initial eats a welcomed chance to settle. It gave me ample opportunity to really enjoy my $4.50 22 Oz. tap of Cow. Just as I was starting to wonder what was keeping the cod, the fish arrived at the bar, and was hotter than fires of hell. While the two long pieces of cod appeared to be on the small side, they would turn out to be anything but. In actuality, it was a 5-piece trapped in a 2-pieces body, with each piece being a good 6-7 inches long. While Ive never seen cod served like it before, it actually worked, probably because the fish was very flaky and moist. While the tartar could have been a little thicker, it was still tasty, and gave the fish a kick (although it did run out while the fish was still flopping).  The fries were cut in-house and fried right. They had the genuine flavor I love, with just a hint of season salt to liven them up. They tasted superb, but werent abundant leaving me wanting another dozen or so. In the end the fish:fry ratio was about 70:30, and you really need at least a 60:40 to get the right balance (if not even a bit more). Wow. For being the NKotB the BBG sure seems to have the right stuff. There is no doubt that well be back sometime soon, but so will everyone else apparently. Between Deaks and Banushis there is some new Fish Fry firepower in Stoughton, and we couldnt be happier about it. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and will come back some night when were in the mood to tackle the crowds. www.banushis.com800 Nygaard StreetStoughton, WI 53589     (608) 873-3700",3146,0.21675751016660105,0.48728934365298

Miss  it was buffet style which is never quite as good. While weve had no real issues with the ESC, and weve taken the hits with the misses, weve always hoped for something more, something less buffet oriented. Until recently Gaylords Catering held rank over the ESC, and rolled out Friday buffet after Friday buffet. After many-a swing and many a-miss a new caterer has taken over in the form of DeBrouxs from Oregon. We went to Brouxnellies (now DeBrouxs Diner) once back in the day and thought it was pretty good, so we didnt waste much time in trying out their new endeavor in Madison or Monona (depending on which side of the fence youre on). Things got off to a good start as we noticed there wasnt a buffet line to be seen anywhere near the large upstairs dining space. The new Fish Fry from DeBroux features AYCE cod, lake perch, or walleye - all fresh from the kitchen and made to order. There is also baked cod also available, buuuuuut The well-coordinated wait staff was taking care of business and our waitress was no exception. She had our order into the kitchen in no time and was very thoughtful throughout. The first thing to hit the table was the coleslaw/soup/salad option, and the slaw I got was really tasty. It was zesty, and fresh, yet very balanced. It was some of the juicier slaw in recent memory, but not at all in a bad way. A basket of bread and cookies came on the heels of the slaw. The bread was very good and had a kind of cornmeal-y consistency. The pecan-cranberry cookies were good too, and although they didnt get chomped until the end, they tempted us throughout. There was a little lag between the apps and the entrée, but the fish was still hot when it arrived. Four fat chunks of cod came in the first round of the AYCE and looked really marvelous. The chunky chunks housed a light beer batter that was good, but not superb. The fish was flaky for the most part, but mostly hidden under the golden-fried wrapper. When it came time for more, I got three and they were even hotter than the first batch although tasted they identical. Lake perch could also be found swimming around the table, and I was lucky enough to snag a bite. Unlike most lake perch these fillets were huge, and while the flavor was fine, and fish was flaky, the size had me thinking they were something other than yellow perch. Dont get me wrong, they were still tasty, but not the tiny, curly, cuts you expect to see. Pike-perch anyone? Some seasoned fries bolstered the bunch, but of course, I forgot to ask if more come with the AYCE. The safe assumption is that they do not, since there were a lot of other options, including: spicy waffle fries, and what is supposedly the worlds greatest baked potato. Last, and possibly least, was the tartar sauce which tasted fine, but had a very odd look. It was home to a lot of big chunks (mostly pickle but some other stuff), and while it was tasty enough it didnt bowl me over. If nothing else, it wasnt overly dilly and thick enough to cling to the creamy cod. There is not a doubt in my mind that the new Fish Fry by DeBroux is a step up from old Gaylord. The simple fact that its not a buffet is a definite plus, but everything tasted better and fresher.

Rarely do you find anything decent at a chain restaurant, and its usually some form of pre-battered nightmare when you do. While we dont avoid chains per se, we dont go out of way to try them either - unless they come recommended from a trusted source... The Texas Roadhouse did. We showed up at the Roadhouse for an early lunch, and were literally the first patrons of the day. The Fish Fry is on the everyday menu for $10.50, but features a $0.50 discount on Fridays, so I guess it counts as a special. Before the fish the Roadhouse rolls out a basket of their well-respected rolls with cinnamon butter. The spheroid-esque starches were soft and chewy, and really quite good if I do say so myself. They led things off with a bang, and before long our sides began to trickle in. The Roadhouse gives you a choice of any two sides with the fish, but unfortunately, there was no coleslaw among them. The full-fledged Caesar salad I chose instead filled in admirably, but instantly made this Fish Fry a little less traditional. It was chockfull of fresh romaine and lathered up with plenty of zesty dressing which is just the way I like it, so I cant really complain too much. After wolfing down the roughage I was more than ready for the fish which appeared moments later and actually looked really good. The fish of record at the Roadhouse is haddock and is actually battered in-house. +1. The three reasonable sized fillets were quite light and flaky, although thinly cut. They were home to a batter that looked wispy, but was deceptively thick. It featured a hearty crunch, and a plethora of sea salt and black pepper sprinkled atop. While it wasnt perfect, there was nothing glaringly wrong with it save for a small amount of grease that leaked out. A handful of steak fries came along on the drive and like the fish were well-seasoned and hearty. They were portioned almost perfectly, and went blow for blow with the fish until the bitter end. A menacing looking tartar rounded out the meal, and while it appeared problematic it was actually decent. It had a lot of chunks and some visible dill and oil, but came off smooth and zippy. The task of tartar is to improve the fish, and this stuff actually did it, so Ill give them credit for that. While we dont live for chain restaurants the way some people do, the Texas Roadhouse certainly made an impression on us. The food was actually pretty tasty, and appeared to be of good quality. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and while wed still rather spend our money at a locally owned establishment, this is one chain that seems to be doing things right. We might actually be back. www.texasroadhouse.com4841 Annamark Dr.Madison, WI 53704     (608) 244-9486",2801,0.11132926298020641,0.4806753519017669

There is renewed interest in our most sacred Wisconsin tradition around the Capitol Square with places like the Tempest and the Tipsy Cow bolstering what was once a sorely lacking Fish Fry scene. These places are honing their craft on a weekly basis, and clearly arent just a flash in the fry pan. However, there are more and more newcomers trying their hand all the time, after all, Friday fish is simple, and anyone can just jump right in and instantly be making the best of the best, right? Wrong.Enter Merchant. The classy cocktail crafter has recently waded into the freshly competitive waters in order to get their own slice of the piscine pie. Their offering comes in on the high side at $16, but as weve learned from the Tempest, when fancy places peddle the perch a bump in price is to be expected, but can be justified. Unfortunately in the case of Merchant, its not. At least not yet. We showed up relatively early but there was a wedding reception taking place inside which led to the only seating besides the bar being outside. While it was a little chilly, it was also a little windy which made everything a little less than pleasant. Eventually the hostess turned the waitress onto the fact that we were actually there to eat (and not just sitting there), and she came over to get us some drinks. Always the thrifty sort, we decided on the $5 bucket of High Life ponies over a $10 cocktail (which seemed like a wise move at the time). Unfortunately, more of the bitty beers had to be retrieved from the basement which took forever and put the kibosh on my plan to get a few down before the main event. Even worse, when they finally did come it was at the exact same time as the fish which left me 6 beers to slam and a whole plate of fish to pound, all in the chilly breeze of a shady Capitol side street. It was a bad start to say the least. Had the fish been stellar all could easily have been forgiven, but alas, it wasnt meant to be. While the plate looked pretty, and seemed to be in order, it wound up being far from it. It featured three butterflies of lake perch which were drown in an incredibly thick buttermilk-beer batter. It was totally ridiculous and easily 70% batter and 30% fish (if not worse). The dense coating was incredibly stubborn and could barely even be peeled away from the suffocated swimmers. The perch itself may have been good, but with so much batter it was impossible to tell. Frying fish is a balancing act and in an effort to stand out Merchant wound up missing the mark altogether on this shot. Pairing with the spongy fish was a reasonable portion of house-cut fries. The spuds were well-fried and lovingly sprinkled with sea salt which gave them just the right finish. The tartar on the other hand was a dilly mess. It actually had a greenish hue thanks to the abundant herb and was overpowering to the max. A fresh and semi-sweet vinegar-based slaw did what it could to save the day, but the ship was already too far gone. While it wasnt upper-echelon slaw, it was fresh, and actually paired quite nicely with the slice of lightly-grilled rye bread on the side. The radical rye was quartered and artfully stacked and when it comes right down to it was probably the highlight of the meal. Well, this wasnt what we were expecting or hoping for from Merchant. The fish and tartar combo was just not right and despite the quality of the sides this fight was pretty much over before it started. Overall, we dont recommend the Fish Fry at Merchant, and wont go back for it unless we hear some changes are made. Its really too bad because we like the establishment and their craft cocktails, but Friday Fish Fry is not a relationship to be entered into lightly, especially with heavily battered perch. www.merchantmadison.com121 S Pinckney StreetMadison, WI 53703     (608) 259-9799",3918,0.08750638569604084,0.5322048896186828

When I go to Miller Park its almost invariably the first thing on my mind with the game coming in a distant second. Almost? What do you mean almost you might ask? Well, once in a while I go to a Brewer game on a Friday. And when I go to a Brewer game on a Friday tailgating instantly becomes an afterthought. The first (and only) thing on my mind in these instances is Hogg Alley and their Famous Friday Fish Fry.Hogg Alley serves up all the fish you could ever want and does them all superbly well. The AYCE cod is fit for a king, the lake perch is lavish, the bluegill is benevolent, and the walleye is nothing short of wonderful. It might seem strange to some, but those who love Fish Fry know that Stolleys is hog heaven. This time I got to sample the $11 bluegill and the $12 walleye and was equally impressed with both. While the walleye fillet wasnt the largest Ive seen thats the only place where it didnt come up big. The fall-apart-flaky fish donned Stolleys signature paper-thin, well-seasoned, lip-smacking, cracker-lacking, ass-smacking, taste bud-tackling, ultra-delicious homemade breading. There simply arent enough hyphens in the world to describe how tasty this stuff is, but I think you get the gist. Its good. The light coating lets the moist, flaky fish come through whether its the walleye, or the bluegill. The sunfish is every bit as enticing as the pike, but has a little bit of that mild fishy taste that makes it unique and sets it apart. Unlike Madison, most places in the Milwaukee area feature potato pancakes with their Fish Fry and the cakes at the Alley might be the best Ive ever had. They are rich and oniony, and complement the fish perfectly. The side of apple sauce that comes with only serves to make them even more alluring, and syrup is even offered for $0.50 extra for those who must have it. As if fantastic fish, and perfect potato pancakes werent enough the Hogg comes correct with a big old squeeze bottle of their homemade tartar. One huge push of this stuff is never enough and I found myself going back time and again for the zesty and creamy concoction. In classic Milwaukee Fish Fry style, salted rye comes along for the ride and plays off the horseradish-laden slaw just right. These are the things that set a great Fish Fry apart from just any old Fish Fry, and Stolley definitely knows it.

When I go to Miller Park its almost invariably the first thing on my mind with the game coming in a distant second. Almost? What do you mean almost you might ask? Well, once in a while I go to a Brewer game on a Friday. And when I go to a Brewer game on a Friday tailgating instantly becomes an afterthought. The first (and only) thing on my mind in these instances is Hogg Alley and their Famous Friday Fish Fry.Hogg Alley serves up all the fish you could ever want and does them all superbly well. The AYCE cod is fit for a king, the lake perch is lavish, the bluegill is benevolent, and the walleye is nothing short of wonderful. It might seem strange to some, but those who love Fish Fry know that Stolleys is hog heaven. This time I got to sample the $11 bluegill and the $12 walleye and was equally impressed with both. While the walleye fillet wasnt the largest Ive seen thats the only place where it didnt come up big. The fall-apart-flaky fish donned Stolleys signature paper-thin, well-seasoned, lip-smacking, cracker-lacking, ass-smacking, taste bud-tackling, ultra-delicious homemade breading. There simply arent enough hyphens in the world to describe how tasty this stuff is, but I think you get the gist. Its good. The light coating lets the moist, flaky fish come through whether its the walleye, or the bluegill. The sunfish is every bit as enticing as the pike, but has a little bit of that mild fishy taste that makes it unique and sets it apart. Unlike Madison, most places in the Milwaukee area feature potato pancakes with their Fish Fry and the cakes at the Alley might be the best Ive ever had. They are rich and oniony, and complement the fish perfectly. The side of apple sauce that comes with only serves to make them even more alluring, and syrup is even offered for $0.50 extra for those who must have it. As if fantastic fish, and perfect potato pancakes werent enough the Hogg comes correct with a big old squeeze bottle of their homemade tartar. One huge push of this stuff is never enough and I found myself going back time and again for the zesty and creamy concoction. In classic Milwaukee Fish Fry style, salted rye comes along for the ride and plays off the horseradish-laden slaw just right. These are the things that set a great Fish Fry apart from just any old Fish Fry, and Stolley definitely knows it. While brats are great and you can make due with hot dogs, they simply cant compare to a Fish Fry as monumental as that of Hogg Alley. Overall, we highly recommend the Hogg and have no problem saying its the best weve ever had. I dont care if the Crew stinks this year, Im ready for another Friday night game.

Its especially difficult to find the perfect Fish Fry (partially because that means something different to just about everyone), but we may have finally gotten as close as possible. Bring on the Hoggs!While Stolleys Hogg Alley isnt what youd call the Madison area its still less than an hour away so we have been there a couple of times. This Friday we had some business in Milwaukee and since it was on our way home the Hogg was the obvious choice, and by god, it was a good one. We showed up on the backend of dinner (around 8pm), but the lateness actually worked in our favor big time. Tables were emptying out, and while we waited for a couple minutes for one to be cleaned it was anything but a hassle. Sitting down we found bowls of coleslaw and German potato salad waiting for us along with a couple slices of super market rye. We assaulted the slaw which was rich and zesty albeit not chilled. It was a good mix, with noticeable horseradish and good-sized carrot cubes. The potato salad was warm and sweet and while were not huge fans of the German variety it was pretty decent. When it comes to Fish Fry rye is where its at and these twins found the sweet spot. Our attempt to sample the chowder fell short as it was sold out, but we werent too upset as Stolleys made up for it and then some. The fish came in no time and was smoldering hot. There were eight bluegill fillets of various sizes all of which were definitely the genuine article. First and foremost Stolleys light batter/breading took center stage. It was ideally seasoned for the delicate fish with plenty of salt and something unique. Its seriously some of the best you will ever eat. The subtle fish flavor of the bluegill pairs so well with it that its almost hard to believe the resultant taste combination. Its nothing short of magical and quite possibly the tastiest fish weve ever had the pleasure to eat. A couple potato pancakes came on the side and were every bit as good as the fish, if not even better. They were laid thin, crispy on the edges, soft in the center, and delicious all around. They were so good we asked for a second helping and the generous waiter brought two more free of chargesometimes it pays to come late, I guess. The tartar lives on the table in a big squeeze bottle and tastes phenomenal. Its incredibly rich and creamy with something special thats tough to pin down. It is very similar in taste and presentation to tartar youll find at Crawfish Junction which puts it into the top tier as far as tartars go. We chowed down on the fish and taters until nary a crumb remained. We were happy. We were satisfied. Then IT happened. When the waiter came to clear the dishes he made an unprecedented offer, one which no one could have seen coming. He said there were a couple more pieces of fish sitting back there if we wanted them. IF we wanted them? Of course, we did. It was free fish!!! Can you believe it? It was like Christmas, your birthday, and Fathers Day all rolled into one.  The fish in question was Stolleys family-style All You Can Eat cod and it was superb. If it had indeed been sitting there it hadnt been sitting long as steam rose from its belly as we cracked it open. It featured big, flaky, planes of pristine fish with the same breading as bluegill (although the spicy shell wasnt quite as alluring on the ocean dweller). Still, it was quite superb, and amazingly free! Free!! FREE!!! Free fish, free potato pancakes, AND a free beer! Whats that, you say? Free beer? Yup, that happened too. Our second beer didnt appear on the bill and when we told the waiter it wasnt there he just gave the dont worry about it gesture. It was really special and certainly something you dont expect at a bar. And speaking of the bill, it was amazing on its own. It read: Bluegill - $12, Side Salad - $4, and that was it. SIXTEEN stinking clams for all that greatness. It was insane and easily makes this the best Fish Fry we have ever had. I mean, how could it not be?

The Fish Fry at Hogg Alley is just too good to stay away from.Actually, I just so happened to find myself in Milwaukee near the Summerfest grounds, and since Hogg Alley is on the way home, I just couldn’t resist. I couldn’t get away until 8:00 and had to put the pedal to the metal since I knew Stolley’s stopped serving fish at 9 (based on their website). I ripped into the lot just after 8:30 and hustled inside, expecting the place to be packed with hungry biker-types. It turned out that the dinner rush had passed and there were only a handful of people in the bar - although there were several folks in the dining room still. I quickly grabbed a tapper of Cow and asked for the Friday menu to see all that there was to see.Since I had the bluegill last time out I wanted to try something else in order to get a better grip on the menu as a whole. I settled on the lake perch after some discussion with the bartender and had a steaming hot plateful in front of me about five minutes later. The perch pieces at Stolley’s are some serious hogs. These were some of the biggest fillets I have ever seen, and dare I say, eerily large. The three musketeers were long and meaty, but thankfully still had the lake perch flair. The meat was smooth and mild, and very flaky. It wore a wafer-thin breading that had a just enough spice so as not to over-power the fish. It was quite impressive, and while I am somewhat perplexed by the sheer size of the fillets, I gotta give Stolley the benefit of the doubt.Riding shotgun were a trio of Stolley’s homemade potato pancakes. While the order normally comes with two of the dreamy cakes, I decided to add another for $1 since I remembered how tasty they were the last time (and I knew I’d want more). The spuds were, again, nothing less than superb. While they were a little thicker than previously, they were every bit as tasty and featured the same subtle onion flavor and spicy undertones. The flavor and texture combination was out of this world and highlighted even more by apple sauce on the side.Further punctuating the meal was a near-perfect tartar sauce. The seemingly homemade sauce was super thick with perfect proportion of relish. Its powerful zip easily put the mild perch in its place so it had to be used sparingly. A creamy coleslaw also had some serious pop and mingled marvelously with the fish when they met in the same mouthful.My rye didn’t come initially, but came quickly once I requested it. The side plate that showed up had two full slices of the starch, both of which were eaten with spoonfuls of slaw and/or tartar and/or butter. All in all, it was a remarkable addition, and a welcomed contrast in flavor.As I did once before, I’m going to go ahead and presume it’s won’t be long before I find myself on a bar stool in Hogg Alley again. It’s simply a great place, with great food, all in the perfect location just outside of Milwaukee. Overall, I highly recommend this Fish Fry and while I would take the bluegill over the lake perch on my next turn, both are incredibly delicious and well worthy of a spot in our Top 25. ‘Til next time!

Is it that one has a sweet Harley? Perhaps its that one has a death wish? Or perhaps one is just curious what that place off the interstate is all about? In reality it might be any of the above, but more than likely it is none, as it was in our case. One can simply go to Hogg Alley for an amazing Fish Fry, and that can be that.Hogg Alley is the biker bar-looking place on the way to Milwaukee with the logo in the shape of the iconic Harley emblem (youll see it down to your left on eastbound 94 just before the Delafield exit). While the place may look like nothing more than a bastion for thirsty bikers (which it indeed is), it is also an oasis of pure Fish Fry pleasure for those looking to fill a tank of a different sort. We pulled our hog into the Alley around 1 PM and were surprised, but not shocked, that there werent a ton of folks around  save for a handful of parched riders perched on the large octagonal picnic tables flanking the entrance. We poked our heads inside briefly to get a lay of the land, and quickly came to the conclusion that the cramped confines paled in comparison to the beautiful Friday sunshine and decided to just set up shop outside. The waitress was a peach, and came over with menus mere moments later and had an ice cold Cow for me not long after that. Vrooom!There are a ton of Friday specials at the pig, starting with an $8 cod (AYCE available for dinner). From there the menu gets into the grimy goodness of $10 bluegill or lake perch, $8.50 smelt or the $12 walleye. While Im a total sucker for each and every one of them, I settled on the bluegill since it is the least common, but the most delicious when done right. Turns out, Stolleys does it right. Amazingly right. Since it wasnt really busy my fish was ready in the blink of an eye. Everything arrived at the table clean and separated  fish, tartar, and potato pancakes on a plate, and slaw, apple sauce and rye in a basket on the side. It was a well thought-out presentation, and clearly the product of years of trial and error. Sure, you could cram it all on one plate, but when you have the extra real estate to play with everything just goes more smoothly and allows you to mix-n-match as you please  and mix-n-match I did. The 7-8 bluegill fillets ranged in size from petite to brawny, but all tasted equally superb. Each was lovingly coated in a light, flaky breading, that had an impeccable amount of seasoning. It paired perfectly with the mild fish taste of the bluegill and was fried as only a true master can do. It all resulted in an amazing combination of flavors that was literally almost perfect. In classic Milwaukee Fish Fry fashion, potato pancakes and rye bread come standard with any Fish Fry. Sure, the Hogg allows you to substitute French fries for the pancakes, but only a crazy person would even consider it since these latkes are something special. They are definitely homemade and likely from some secret family recipe (the kind that one might be able to find out about, but would surely have to be killed shortly thereafter). They tantalized the taste buds with their delightfully crispy edges, and subtle onion flavor that was just enough to make you take notice. When a dollop of the included apple sauced was added they became even more delectable, and although I didnt need it, they probably would have been great with the syrup that is also available at no additional charge. A full slice of marble rye was served with soft butter, and was a welcome change from the basic dinner roll you find at most Madison Fish Frys. It brought a nice contrast to the fish and paired elegantly with the mellow horseradish undertone of the creamy coleslaw. It was a delightful combo and although the slaw was probably the worst part of the meal, it was still delicious, which really says something about the overall quality of this Fish Fry. When fish is fried as well as it is at Hogg Alley the tartar sauce can become an afterthought  just slap something on there, they wont use it anyway, right? Wrong. Any seasoned Fish Fryer knows that while great fish can stand on its own two fins, a terrific tartar can take it into even deeper deliciousness, and thats just what Stolleys sauce does. Their rendition is thick and creamy with just the right amount of relish. It is incredibly similar to our beloved Wilsons sauce and although the fish didnt need it, it boosted every bit it did bless. While some might say were crazy, I think this is easily one of best Fish Frys weve ever had. There is no doubt in my mind that Stolleys could go toe-to-toe with any Fish Fry in the state and give them a serious run for their money, if not beat them down altogether. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and will definitely be coming back  more than likely every single time we go to Milwaukee from here on out. www.stolleyshoggalley.com2008 Venice Beach RdOconomowoc, WI 53066     (262) 646-5652",4965,0.22000072150072153,0.5814494949494948

When it comes to getting the word out we tend to take the highroad more often than not and simply let our work speak for itself, however, we realize that there are those who want to promote their Fish Fry, and if we hear enough about it we are inevitably going to give them a shot. Sajs on Main up in Pardeeville is one of these flagrant fish promoters.Pardeeville isnt exactly in the Madison area, but we happened to be heading north this Friday so we took a small detour in order to see if Saj was worth his salt. We easily found parking on the main drag, and were seated at a table in their dining hall a few minutes later. Sajs is clearly the Friday Fish hotspot in Pardeeville, and although it was busy the service was fast and friendly (despite the fact that it was our waitress first day). The fish of choice on Main is the AYCE haddock, and although I was tempted by their Catch of the Day (which happened to be walleye), I stuck with the regulars and ordered the AYCE.Prior to the fishs arrival Saj trots out your sides. In addition to the standard slaw, a bowl of what appeared to be homemade baked beans joined the fold. The enticing legumes were smoky and rich, and offset the ultra-creamy, but not ultra-tasty, slaw. Before we could make our way through the sides the fish showed up and our focus shifted. The first plate had a mixed bag of big and small pieces, but all were exceedingly hot. I started with the smallest of the trio and it (unfortunately) had a distinctive fishy taste. It was clearly a tail piece, and not very good, but luckily it was the odd man out. The other two chunks were fatter and smoother, and boasted a flaky texture and clean flavor. They were enhanced somewhat by Sajs light beer batter which was not memorable, but not problematic either. It was very solid fish, but certainly not the best weve come across. Pairing with the fish were a bunch of battered fries. They skin-on spuds were delightfully crispy and may well have even been cut in-house although I kind of doubt it. Regardless, they had a great taste and the waitress even pulled a couple strings to get me another small helping with my second plate of fish. A thick and creamy tartar came in individual Solo cups and put the finishing touches on the fish. It was so good in fact that it even covered up the flaws in the tail pieces while making the good stuff all the better - truly top-notch tartar. Last, but certainly not least, was a little rye roll which was good, but not great. While we love the traditional slice of rye, or pumpernickel, this little loaf just didnt have it, although it was still an improvement over a plain white dinner roll. While Pardeeville isnt necessarily the place to be, if you find yourself in the homey hamlet, Sajs definitely is. The food was good, and they are clearly doing everything they can to be the Friday night hotspot. Overall, we do highly recommend the Fish Fry at Sajs, although we probably wouldnt make the trek from Madison if we werent already on the way. It was good, just not that good.www.facebook.com/SajsOnMain134 N Main StreetPardeeville, WI 53954     (608) 429-4000",3272,0.16003819989534274,0.4774488487702775

It's essentially flawless and that's why we have no problem taking the drive out to Milford every few months when we have the time. It's really one of the best out there and I'm not even sure how I can further elaborate upon their greatness, but here it goes...CJ has tons of fish to choose from and the best part is that they will let you mix and match them until your heart's content (except for the walleye, that big boy is off limits). This Friday I just couldn't help myself and decided to mix fresh with fresh (water that is) and paired a 1/4 lb of lake perch with a 1/4 lb bluegill. While it wasn't cheap at 17 beans it was worth every freaking penny in my humble, fish-loving opinion. Being that I was waaaaay after the typical lunch crowd at 1:30, I was one of the few food orders at the time so my fish was ready in three minutes or so after I ordered it and that is no exaggeration. As expected, both styles of fish were superb. Five full lake perch (as much as a full order most places) and 4 fat bluegill fillets too over the plate and made the $17 more than justified. Both species shared the same ultra-flavorful and flaky breading and while the bluegill was slightly fisher (as you'd expect), the breading worked as well on it as it did the perch. Speaking of the real deal yellow perch, it had plenty of flavor on its own and was complemented equally well (if not even better) by the lavishly seasoned breading. Neither fish had any grease whatsoever making for guilt-free munching throughout. Talk about heaven. While the fish at the Junction shines the skin-on freezer fries are just that...freezer fries. While they are really nothing special there are plenty of them, so I can't really complain. The tartar sauce is special however, and the beefy blend comes in a big squeeze bottle and packs a serious punch. Certain tartars have a little something special about them, and this is one of those. It's hard to know exactly what it is that makes it so good (I think foodies call it umami), but whatever it is I took four bog old squirts of it. The closer you get to Milwaukee the more you will find rye with your Friday Fish Fry and Crawfish plops a big, soft, squishy slice on the plate. It's a real people please and goes perfectly with the creamy and slightly pungent slaw. This cabbage concoction isn't the typical Sysco stuff, and while it might just be the Dierk's derivative instead, it's way better than average (Dierk's is just another food distributor out of Waukesha in case you were wondering). While we don't want to sound like a broken record it's hard no to when expounding the virtues of a place like Crawfish Junction. The fish is simply wonderful and all the sides add to it without drawing attention away from it. It's the definition of balance and makes us want to come back time and again. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and will keep coming back basically every chance we get. It's just so damn good. www.crawfishjunction.comW6376 Cty Hwy AJohnson Creek (Milford), WI 53038     (920) 648-3550",3159,0.22461940836940833,0.4382263107263109

It's really one of the best out there and I'm not even sure how I can further elaborate upon their greatness, but here it goes...CJ has tons of fish to choose from and the best part is that they will let you mix and match them until your heart's content (except for the walleye, that big boy is off limits). This Friday I just couldn't help myself and decided to mix fresh with fresh (water that is) and paired a 1/4 lb of lake perch with a 1/4 lb bluegill. While it wasn't cheap at 17 beans it was worth every freaking penny in my humble, fish-loving opinion. Being that I was waaaaay after the typical lunch crowd at 1:30, I was one of the few food orders at the time so my fish was ready in three minutes or so after I ordered it and that is no exaggeration. As expected, both styles of fish were superb. Five full lake perch (as much as a full order most places) and 4 fat bluegill fillets too over the plate and made the $17 more than justified. Both species shared the same ultra-flavorful and flaky breading and while the bluegill was slightly fisher (as you'd expect), the breading worked as well on it as it did the perch. Speaking of the real deal yellow perch, it had plenty of flavor on its own and was complemented equally well (if not even better) by the lavishly seasoned breading. Neither fish had any grease whatsoever making for guilt-free munching throughout. Talk about heaven. While the fish at the Junction shines the skin-on freezer fries are just that...freezer fries. While they are really nothing special there are plenty of them, so I can't really complain. The tartar sauce is special however, and the beefy blend comes in a big squeeze bottle and packs a serious punch. Certain tartars have a little something special about them, and this is one of those. It's hard to know exactly what it is that makes it so good (I think foodies call it umami), but whatever it is I took four bog old squirts of it. The closer you get to Milwaukee the more you will find rye with your Friday Fish Fry and Crawfish plops a big, soft, squishy slice on the plate. It's a real people please and goes perfectly with the creamy and slightly pungent slaw. This cabbage concoction isn't the typical Sysco stuff, and while it might just be the Dierk's derivative instead, it's way better than average (Dierk's is just another food distributor out of Waukesha in case you were wondering). While we don't want to sound like a broken record it's hard no to when expounding the virtues of a place like Crawfish Junction. The fish is simply wonderful and all the sides add to it without drawing attention away from it. It's the definition of balance and makes us want to come back time and again. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and will keep coming back basically every chance we get. It's just so damn good. www.crawfishjunction.comW6376 Cty Hwy AJohnson Creek (Milford), WI 53038     (920) 648-3550",3159,0.22461940836940833,0.4382263107263109

Those same naysayers might also add they dont want to go all that way just to get some fish. To those people I can only say, your loss.Crawfish Junction has, one of, if not the best Fish Frys in the area, and Id argue one of the best in the entire state. They have every fish frying fish under the sun and are one of the few places Ive ever seen that has fresh, yes fresh, bluegill. While it is 16 big bones, Id gladly pay even more. Its so good its hard to even put into wordsbut Ill give it a shot. For starters, the portion is gigundo. If there was one fillet there were 10 and most were lush and meaty. I hadnt eaten much bluegill recently and this stuff reminded me how great it can be. The fine fillets had the subtly fishy undertones that set bluegill apart from its contemporaries and when theyre paired with CJs signature breading something special happens. The light breading has just the right blend of spices which offsets the flaky bluegill in ways that are indescribably delicious. There are no rubbery textures here which is the bane of many-a bluegill. Just eat them and enjoy. House-cut fries are tough to cook and while the taters at the Junction might look dark, they are anything but burned. While this portion wasnt huge, the kids FF had plenty to steal and believe me, none went to waste. Rarely can the following statement be made, but the homemade tartar at Crawfish is just as good as the fish. Its rich and creamy with a zip that is impossible to dissect but easy to love. Its without a doubt some of the best sauce out there and takes the fish to the next notch...and the notch above thatand the notch above that and the notchA big slab of marble rye comes along with any of the fish, and since we were early the butter that accompanied ours was rock hard. No matter, the bread was fresh, and while it could well have just been a grocery store loaf it doesnt bother me one bit. The slaw was a finely-chopped and while the first bite didnt bowl me over I just kept coming back for more. It was kind of like beer nuts in that way. The jig is up as I think the folks at CJ know who were are. Thats alright by me, and I dont think weve received any sort of special treatment because of it. They know we just like delicious fish and thats the game they are in. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and think its easily one of the best weve ever had. Take the drive, eat the fish, and thank me later. www.crawfishjunction.comW6376 Cty Hwy AJohnson Creek (Milford), WI 53038     (920) 648-3550",2615,0.2543948412698413,0.4774149659863946

Crawfish has one of the best Fish Frys the area has to offer and bringing anyone to it, especially family members, is sure to earn you some credibility.Since we had a toddler with us we arrived early to ensure we got a table and didnt have to mill around the bar with him. Our forethought paid off as not only did we get a nice big table for our party of five, but also the opportunity to get a few beers in while we waited for everyone else to arrive. He played cars, we drank Cows, a good time was had by all. You dont see alligator on many menus in these parts so we decided to give the reptile parts a go. The bite-sized bits of gator were good (and did not taste like chicken). The meat was moist with a slightly elastic texture, but not rubbery in any way. Of course, the highlight was the breading which is the same ultra-seasoned and mouthwatering stuff that comes on the fish. The entrees came shortly after wed made our way through the appetizer and was everything I expected it to be. Crawfish has basically every fish under the sun and before today Id tried them all except for the walleye. This fillet was so large it essentially hung off the plate. The fish was as flaky as they come, and so delicate that it couldnt even be handled. While I was forced to use a fork rather than my hands even that couldnt ruin the experience of this fish. It was everything walleye should be and enhanced even further by the oh-so-excellent breading. Anything this breading touches turns to gold and therefor it shall be known as the Midas touch from this day forward. Crawfish has plenty of sides to choose from but I went for the default house-cut fries which were anything but standard. The hearty portion of spuds were well-fried, well-seasoned, and simply well-done. They are so much better than freezer fries its not even funny and just add so much more to the meal. The tartar here is some of the best around, boasting a unique flavor that isnt found anywhere else. Rather than the plain white sauce you see everywhere else, the Craw-sauce has a creamy color that hints at more than the basic blend of mayo and relish. While I couldnt say exactly what it is (which is a good thing), I can say its superb and feel content leaving it at that. A whole slice of marble rye begs to be eaten with the Crawfishs homemade slaw, and while they are both pungent and far better than average they pretty much get lost in the shuffle. By the time you get past the wonderful walleye, the fantastic fries, and the tantalizing tartar there just isnt much the sides can do to stand out. Its almost too bad really as they are way better than the offerings at most other places. Crawfish Junction continues to impress and with a lineup like this its easy to see why. Their bluegill is some of the best, the perch borders on perfection, the cod is commendable, and the walleye packs a wallop. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and wouldnt argue with anyone who said its the best theyve ever had. It really is that good and I think the family would agree. www.crawfishjunction.comW6376 Cty Hwy AJohnson Creek (Milford), WI 53038     (920) 648-3550",3296,0.2387777777777777,0.49772354497354493

Regardless, they continued to reel in the award based on loyalty and their once-sparking reputation. It took a while for our fair city to finally come around  we Wisconsinites are a stubborn lot  but the page has finally turned (at least for a year). During the Avenues multi-year dip several new places invaded the Fish Fry field with a vengeance, one of which is Crawfish Junction way out in Milford (yes, Milford is a real place). Crawfish, as they call themselves, took the top spot in this years poll and it couldnt be anymore well-deserved. Crawfish truly has a great all-around Fish Fry. The tavern on steroids has almost every Fish Fry fish under the sun and serves them all each and every Friday. In addition, theyll mix-and-match any of them (except for the walleye) so diners can sample until their hearts content. This round we mixed the bluegill with the lake perch and basically got a full portion of each (8 bluegill and 6 perch fillets) for our $17.00. Not a bad deal all things considered. This fish is all-around amazing. Both styles feature the same idyllically=seasoned breading which is light and golden and lends plenty of salty contrast to the flaky fish. The bluegill has just the right essence while the perch was clearly the real deal yellow perch. Both are equally amazing and are sure to have any Fish Fry purist tickled pink. A smallish portion of superbly-crunchy, seasoned fries cozy up to the freshwater finsters and are as satisfying as they come. The tartar is equally alluring as it has something unique that makes it one of the best out there. Its thick and creamy with plenty of relish and a unique base that makes it stand out. Its a real nozzle-plugger which necessitates bringing some muscle to the table to operate the oversized squeeze bottle. Just dont squeeze too hardMarble rye accompanies all the fish at Crawfish and is a welcome addition to the table.

At those times you go to Crawfish Junction.Crawfish, as they call themselves, is out of the way. Its nestled on the banks of the Crawfish River in the tiny village of Milford between Lake Mills and Johnson Creek. It is the definition of a destination Fish Fry, and a destination we seek out often. Its simply a great little place that happens to have remarkable food and is just far enough away to make for a good cruise without it being an total ordeal. Crawfish also lets you mix-n-match their Fish Fry options, and while weve stuck to the fresh freshwater fish in past today we branched out (albeit a tiny branch). We love the bluegill at the Junction and for $15 its actually a decent deal so we almost always just go that route, but today we really wanted to try the cod since thats what 80% of people order and we wanted to get the inside scoop (people around here just love cod, so what are you gonna do). For $15.50 you can mix-n-match any of this fish (although if you want walleye of alligator in the combo it is slightly more) and we went cod and bluegill in ours. The lunch rush had subsided by the time we got there so our fish was ready in a jiffy. The combo consisted of two pieces of cod ($9.00 on its own), and 5 fillets of bluegill (about half an order), fries, slaw, rye bread, and tartar. Since it was an unknown we started with the cod and were instantly impressed. It was super flaky and 100% grease-free. It featured a light and crispy breading, with some seasoning but not so much that is overwhelmed the fish. The plains of meat were stark white and pristine, resulting in some really well executed cod. The bluegill was no slouch either, and actually still better than the cod in our opinion, but keep in mind we do LOVE our bluegill. Weve come to expect a potent blend of herbs and spices in the bluegill breading and although it wasnt as in your face as were used to, it was still stellar. It melded perfectly with the high quality fish and its mild fishy flavor. Historically, one of the only shortcomings with the Fish at Crawfish were the French fries. They basically just toed the line on spuds and did the freezer fry bit like most other places. Weve always been sure to note that and they finally took notice (at least thats what were telling ourselves). The new fries are the kind we love  house-cut from whole potatoes and fried just right. The portion was plentiful and while there were tons of nubs mixed in with the full-sizers they are every bit as tasty albeit a little harder to handle. Not coincidentally they are the perfect size for pint-size Fish Fry fan fingers like the one we had with us so you know every nub got nibbled. Tartar is one element of the Fish Fry that should never be skimped on and with a whole squeeze bottle to go around its not overlooked at the Junction. The zesty, flavorful mix kicks some serious tail and really took both styles of fish to task. The marble rye also brought down the house, and although it was a little crumbly, it still had the stank and complemented the finely-chopped homemade slaw just right. Sometimes you just want to get away from it all, and sometimes you want a really great Fish Fry.

Simple as that.Crawfish has just about every fish under the sun and while I was curious about the cod, wooed by the walleye, lured by the lake perch, attracted to the alligator, and courted by the crawfish I once again went for the fresh bluegill. I mean, its fresh bluegill, what do you expect me to do? Im hooked on it. The kitchen at Crawfish is smokin (not literally this time around thankfully) and I had a smoldering hot plate of fish at my bar stool in less than five minutes (at least Im pretty sure there was a plate under there somewhere). The menu states that a half-pound of fish comes with each order and this time around that added up to 10 total fillets. The sunfish varied in size from teeny weenie to mucho grande, and likely made the 8 ounce threshold and then some. There is something special about fresh fish as its moister than the frozen stuff and the meat much more supple. The resulting texture is flaky rather than rubbery, and the meat sweet tasting rather than fishy. The Junction coats them in a breading that is light in color as well as feel, although today it was missing some of the seasoning weve become accustomed to. Even so, it was still an excellent rendition but not as close to perfection as expected. When fish is fresh youd expect the fries to follow suit and they certainly do at Crawfish. While hand-cut fries are far superior to freezer fries they can be hard to prepare if the cook isnt on their game. Whereas the fish was bountiful the fries were hard to come by and a little under-fried. They were on the dark side, had no seasoning to speak of, and clung together. Meh. Picking up and slack left by the fish and fries was the homemade tartar sauce. There was a whole squeeze bottle of the sweet nectar just for me and it was supplied chilled. It was flavorful, had the perfect zip, and was just what the doctor (and the fish) ordered. A small cup of slaw was hidden under a split slice of marble rye and was a little runny, but really tasty. The rye itself was soft and fresh  just as it should be. I have to believe that someday I will be able to break free from the spell that Crawfishs bluegill has me under and try some of their other scrumptious sounding offerings. Until that day comes I will just have to live with the delicious freshness that the sunfish offers. Overall, we continue to highly recommend the bluegill at Crawfish Junction, its just as simple as that. www.crawfishjunction.comW6376 Cty Hwy AJohnson Creek (Milford), WI 53038     (920) 648-3550",2598,0.15997194981888857,0.551160511823777

You go right back to Crawfish Junction the next chance you get and have it again, thats what. The Fish Fry at Crawfish Junction is really something special, and put together as well as any we have seen. The fish is fresh, the fries are expertly fried, the tartar borders on perfection, the slaw is fresh and zesty, and they actually serve real rye bread. Hallelujah! It can be done, and the recently renovated bar proves it.The Junction just reopened after a fire, and even though they were out of commission for a while their fish is still smokin. On both of my recent trips I went for the $15 fresh bluegill, and while pricy, I never once came anywhere near having buyers remorse since the portion is princely and everything is incredibly high quality. Both times the fish came in the blink of an eye, and was steaming hot. The quoted ½ pound of bluegill works out to seven fillets, each of which is a tiny bit of heaven. They are flaky, moist little buggers with a light breading that complements the subtle bluegill flavor perfectly. The coating is salty and delicious, and provides just the right balance to make your tastes buds crave more and more. You can literally taste the freshness of this fish, and when you can get your hands on fresh fish at a Fish Fry you simply have to do it. It really does make a difference. Pairing with the benevolent bluegill is the Junctions homemade tartar. The sauce comes in a full-sized squeeze bottle, and on both of these visits it came chilled. Its thick and creamy with a superb zip that bumps the bluegill up yet another notch. On both visits I went back for more three times over, and sopped up the sauce with fish and fry alike. While Id love to see what the Crawfish Junction could do with potato pancakes the French fries they offer get the job done, and then some. The skin-on spuds are fried to perfection and spruced up with some serious season salt. They are firm to the touch, but gentle on the gums, and plentiful enough to go blow for blow with the bountiful bluegill. 3.5 ounces of coleslaw is too much at a lot of places, but not at CJ. Their finely-chopped, homemade slaw has a tremendous flavor, a good consistency, and a zip that keeps you coming back for more. It is some of the finest you will find, and buddies up with the marble rye to form a truly formidable tandem. A full slice of rye is a welcome addition at any Fish Fry, but it puts the perfect finishing touch on this near-perfect Fish Fry. On both visits the rye was soft and fresh, and while no butter was provided either time, rest assured had I requested some it would have been there lickety-split. At this point Im not entirely sure how Im going to keep myself from taking the short trek down I-94 each and every Friday.

You go right back to Crawfish Junction the next chance you get and have it again, thats what. The Fish Fry at Crawfish Junction is really something special, and put together as well as any we have seen. The fish is fresh, the fries are expertly fried, the tartar borders on perfection, the slaw is fresh and zesty, and they actually serve real rye bread. Hallelujah! It can be done, and the recently renovated bar proves it.The Junction just reopened after a fire, and even though they were out of commission for a while their fish is still smokin. On both of my recent trips I went for the $15 fresh bluegill, and while pricy, I never once came anywhere near having buyers remorse since the portion is princely and everything is incredibly high quality. Both times the fish came in the blink of an eye, and was steaming hot. The quoted ½ pound of bluegill works out to seven fillets, each of which is a tiny bit of heaven. They are flaky, moist little buggers with a light breading that complements the subtle bluegill flavor perfectly. The coating is salty and delicious, and provides just the right balance to make your tastes buds crave more and more. You can literally taste the freshness of this fish, and when you can get your hands on fresh fish at a Fish Fry you simply have to do it. It really does make a difference. Pairing with the benevolent bluegill is the Junctions homemade tartar. The sauce comes in a full-sized squeeze bottle, and on both of these visits it came chilled. Its thick and creamy with a superb zip that bumps the bluegill up yet another notch. On both visits I went back for more three times over, and sopped up the sauce with fish and fry alike. While Id love to see what the Crawfish Junction could do with potato pancakes the French fries they offer get the job done, and then some. The skin-on spuds are fried to perfection and spruced up with some serious season salt. They are firm to the touch, but gentle on the gums, and plentiful enough to go blow for blow with the bountiful bluegill. 3.5 ounces of coleslaw is too much at a lot of places, but not at CJ. Their finely-chopped, homemade slaw has a tremendous flavor, a good consistency, and a zip that keeps you coming back for more. It is some of the finest you will find, and buddies up with the marble rye to form a truly formidable tandem. A full slice of rye is a welcome addition at any Fish Fry, but it puts the perfect finishing touch on this near-perfect Fish Fry. On both visits the rye was soft and fresh, and while no butter was provided either time, rest assured had I requested some it would have been there lickety-split. At this point Im not entirely sure how Im going to keep myself from taking the short trek down I-94 each and every Friday. The fresh bluegill is simply out of this world and actually makes the 30 minute drive an enjoyable voyage of anticipation. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry, and think its one of the best weve ever had or will ever have.  www.crawfishjunction.comW6376 Cty Hwy AJohnson Creek (Milford), WI 53038     (920) 648-3550",3158,0.2486810599946193,0.45773876782351364

The brown door on the left leads to the main dining room, while the brown one on the right heads directly into the bar. Since it was my first visit I unknowingly entered on the left and clumsily found my way over to the bar  clearly a rookie in these parts.  Luckily for me, most people in the dining room were focused on their food and the bar itself was relatively empty during the lunch hour so my unfamiliarity only drew a few subtle smirks. I made a quick recovery, casually bellied up to the bar, ordered a beer, and asked for the Fish menu to which the bartender gladly obliged. I was in!The Friday specials at Crawfish Junction are numerous and include all the usual suspects from cod, walleye, lake perch, and bluegill, to some of the not-so-usual suspects like alligator and crawfish tails. They average around $15 which isnt necessarily cheap, but when you consider the quality it seems pretty reasonable. Whats more, they even give you options to mix-n-match almost all of them - which is a real rarity. Its an impressive spread to say the least, but when I saw the $15 Lake Erie Lake Perch was FRESHNEVER FROZEN WHEN AVAILABLE it left me with only one question: Is it available? It was. It took about 10 minutes, but my freshly fried fresh fish looked otherworldly when it arrived. The six generous fillets were smoking hot and gave me pause, though brief it was. As soon as was humanly possible I grabbed one up and took my first bite. I could tell instantly the claims of freshness were true  it was superb. The perch was soft and smooth without a lick of fishiness. The limber fillets were complimented by a lightly seasoned breading that let the immaculately flaky fish shine through. It was as impressive as any perch that has crossed these lips (and that is saying something).Buddying up with the flawless fish was a big old squeeze bottle of homemade tartar sauce. While it wasnt cold, the tartar in the tube was tasty as all get out. It was of the creamy variety, but in all honesty could have been a little creamier. Regardless, it had the right amount of relish, was incredibly smooth, and, most importantly, didnt overwhelm the delicate fish even though it easily could have. Following the fish was a side of freezer fries that were average in every way except in the quality of the frying job. These tasty tubers were flawlessly fried and had a satisfying crunch that offset the pulsating perch perfectly. Adding even more allure to the plate was a full slice of fresh marble rye bread. The staple starch was soft and delicious and offered just the right amount of stank. It paired admirably with the standard Solo cup of coleslaw and helped to put the finishing touches on what was an amazing Fish Fry. Regardless of which door you choose you are going to find amazing things at Crawfish Junction. From friendly bartenders to fantastic fish, its all in Milford. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and can hardly wait to come back and try some of their mouthwatering options.www.crawfishjunction.comW6376 Cty Hwy AJohnson Creek (Milford), WI 53038     (920) 648-3550",3154,0.2184425962165688,0.5624037834311805

Even though wed been to Masons a couple times before we had our doubts about this upcoming visit. Why were we worried, you ask? Well, a bunch of negative reviews from Google Users had cropped up online berating the service and food, and we thought that maybe things had taken and nosedive since our last visit. We were worried, but we followed through, and were certainly glad we did.Maybe it was the negative reviews, or maybe theyve gained a bad reputation in Oregon (things like that can happen quickly in small towns), but whatever it was they were noticeably less busy than on our previous visits. We had no trouble getting a table for four right away and an experienced waitress was at our side in no time. Masons isnt one of those places just offering fish to fit in, they do Fish Fry right. They offer walleye, lake perch, and cod and between the four of us we got to try all three. The cod comes as a 2, 3, or 4-piece starting at $12 and ending up at $15. Things got off to a bit of a rocky start as the food arrived and the 4-piece cod with potato pancakes was nowhere to be found. A plate of walleye arrived instead, but the waitress quickly realized the error and gathered up the errand plate switching it out for freshly fried cod within five minutes. A free dessert was offered for the mix up and while it wasnt necessary the Crème Brule was certainly welcome. The 4-piece was nothing if not plentiful. The fat loins were home to a thick beer batter that was more substantial than wed like it to be. The copious coating also didnt have much flavor so the pristine Icelandic cod didnt get much assistance. The fish itself was flaky and greaseless resulting in a solid rendition although there was nothing truly remarkable about it. The walleye was noticeably more flavorful than the cod and seemed to have the same beer batter although it was applied much more conservatively. The lake perch on the other hand was markedly better than either and stole the show yet again. Unlike its beer battered brethren the perch featured a light, crunchy breading with a succulent blend of seasonings. It had a subtle saltiness and was easily enjoyed with or without tartar. Speaking of the sauce, Masons version is clearly made in-house. While it looked like it was going to be ultra-dilly, it surprisingly wasnt. It had plenty of zip which gave the cod a little something to hold onto. There are a plethora of sides to choose from and the potato pancakes were a good pick. They were thin and crispy although lacking a little in the onion department. The paired really well with the side of apple sauce, but were amazing when dunked in the syrup (both available free of charge). Some warm bread came before the fish, accompanied by a side of absolutely superb olive butter. The bread itself had a moist, dense, ciabatta feel, and when paired with the specialty butter was out of this world. While we were a little worried going in our fears were quickly cast aside as Masons delivered another amazing Fish Fry.

We truly dedicated souls want, no need, something more. We need more fish, more of the time, at more places. We are the devoted masses, the cultivators of local tradition, and the hungry soul of this great state. We are the Fish Fryers, and if we want to get fish on a Tuesday were damn well going to do it! And chances are were going to do it at Masons on Main in Oregon.Our friends Stan and Megan (who recently bought a home in the sleepy suburb) met us at the fancy downtown dining spot, and since it was Tuesday we had no problem getting a table. We chose the bar side instead of the dining room side again if for no other reason that it was right there. Our waitress came by momentarily and scurried off to grab us some drinks and the menus that the hostess had forgotten. Since it was Tuesday the special menu Masons flaunts on Friday was obviously absent. However, being an ever-diligent Fish Fryer, I checked out their regular menu ahead of time and noted that they offer bluegill and lake perch throughout the week. I put in an order for the bluegill, with a side of fries and sat back thinking I had made a wise move. Of course, not three minutes later the waitress returned to our table and informed whoever got the bluegill that is was unavailable. Blast! I settled on the perch instead (since it was my only other option). Before the fish arrived a basket of little freshly baked, football-shaped rolls were thrown our way. The crusty little buggers featured some nice spices and a dish of soft whipped butter. They were all that, but still not quite as alluring as the Friday rye. The entrees took about 15 minutes more, but were well worth the wait. My plate was loaded with four fat butterflies which amounted to eight ample perch fillets. The elite eight were paired with an expertly spiced breading, that complimented the moist, succulent fish perfectly. It was devilishly delicious and the kind of fish you could just sit back and eat for days and days. While eight was enough, I could probably have eaten 18. Pairing with the perch were a slew of skin-on French fries which appeared to be cut in-house. Like the fish, these taters were terrific and seasoned by a true pro. While they would likely be too salty for some (my mom for example), they were right up my alley as the sodium soaked spuds kept my taste buds a-rumblin.Perch this flavorful can easily be eaten on its own, but when the right tartar comes along it is almost sinful to do so. The sauce at Masons it thick and rich with a zip that really puts the icing on the cake. It was a remarkable rendition that had me scraping bottom by the end. If there was one failing to the non-Friday Fish Fry it was the lack of coleslaw. While Masons paddles in boatloads of the homemade side on Friday, during the week it is replaced by some sautéed mixed vegetables, which are fine, but didnt add much to the meal. The last thing on my plate was a tiny lemon wedge which went unused fish this good does not want for citrus. We all love Friday Fish, but sometimes one day a week just isnt enough. In these instances its nice to see have something to fall back on, and MoM is helping to fill that void. While this isnt the cheapest Fish Fry you are going to find, it is very high quality, and extremely delicious, so you have to take the good with the bad. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and are actually coming to enjoy the drive to Oregon.

What was once your basic AYCE beer battered cod scene is slowly morphing into freshly caught freshwater fish scene with an emphasis on quality and preparation over sheer quantity. While Id like to think MFF is partially responsible for the transition, its more of a reflection on the demands modern day fish goer  those who want quality, but also sustainability, accountability, and adherence to tradition. Its a pleasure to witness the change firsthand and see the market respond to what people are asking for. Nowhere is this trend more evident than at the new Masons on Main. Masons is a swanky new downtown restaurant in Oregon with all the flair youd expect to find at a fancy Square-side restaurant in Madison. It is a beautifully restored older building with a great bar/bistro area on one side, offset by a formal dining room on the other. There are all sorts of fish to choose from on Friday night including the commonplace cod and walleye, but also the resurgent bluegill and lake perch. I was definitely swimming in friendly waters. All of the fish options sounded great, but I settled on the $16 Lake Michigan lake perch since five little letters appeared before it, F-R-E-S-H. When perch is fresh it is something special and since Jer was getting the bluegill I knew Id get to sample it anyway, so perch it was. It took a little while for the fish to arrive which gave us plenty of time to enjoy a side of the Masons fresh oysters. The mollusks filled the void admirably and kept our focus momentarily, until it happened. A boat-shaped tub of tartar splashed down on our table, followed by a coleslaw bomb. Before we could take in what had just happened the fish dove in too - steaming hot, and looking good. Our waitress was somewhat confused as to what was what between the perch and bluegill orders, but we got it straightened out eventually. Three butterflies come on the perch plate and were plush and meaty. They were clearly fresh and complemented by a light, flaky breading. The coating had a nice seasoning which blended with the supple fish to create a truly harmonious flavor. It wasnt fish + breading, it was one harmonious unit of mellow deliciousness. The bluegill was more of the same, and maybe even a little bit better. It was slightly fishier, but had the same breading and same melding of textures and taste. Both fish were superb, and I bet the Icelandic cod and Lake Erie walleye would have followed suit had we ordered them. The rebirth of the traditional Fish Fry is further witnessed by MoMs potato pancakes. This most traditional of sides is rarely seen in Madison, since they add a lot of extra work to the meal. The cakes at Masons came with the standard side of apple sauce, and while they were nice to see, were not perfectly executed. They were on the thick-side, and lacked the salty/oniony undertones the best ones have. They were dark, but not crispy, and really could have used a little something to perk them up. A couple little crostini-like rye wedges came along for the ride and were a little crisp, but added nice contrast in texture and flavor. Some super fancy looking whipped butter came with them. The two canoes that paddled in before the fish were filled to the brim with goodness. The tartar was thick and creamy and didnt have any capers or other crazy nonsense like that. It was simply superb and quietly improved the fish. The slaw was also delicious, and clearly made in-house. It was finely chopped (almost minced), lovingly prepared, and so light it was almost aerated. Since both slaw and tartar came family-style there was lots to go around, and go around it did (we needed the waitress to portage in a second boat of tartar for us). Oregon hasnt traditionally been known as a Fish Fry hotspot, but that all may have just changed thanks to Masons on Main. Theyve really put their mark on the Wisconsin classic and created something to be proud of. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry, and are glad to see places returning to what made the Wisconsin tradition so revered in the first place  freshwater fish, potato pancakes, creamy tartar, homemade slaw, and rye bread, all living harmoniously together.

I went for the clam chowder which was homemade and actually really good although it wasn’t very creamy. The people who got salads got bread but we soup eaters did not which kind of sucked. As I finished the cup of chowder I was wishing I had some but tried to put it out of my mind as I waited for the fish which arrived about 10 minutes later. The perch were served as four small sized butterflies which amounted to eight filets. The fish tasted very good and had a light, yet firm batter which was decent but not super flavorful. It could definitely have used a little more salt but was still very good and a fine value at 12 bucks.I managed to sneak a piece of the cod as well and it was much better than the last time but still was not great. It had a light batter but the fish was not really flaky and almost felt mushy. It was not bad but looked like it should have been better. Much like the perch it didn’t have a real distinct flavor which was kind of a bummer. I will also caveat this by saying that I didn’t get a scalding hot piece which may have been better. The accompanying items were all good and rounded out the meal well. The straight cut style fries were very good as were the curly fries which several folks around the table got. The tartar also helped the fish even though there was clearly a hint of dill, it was practically unnoticeable. One thing that was noticeable was how great our waitress was when we were ordering and how absent she was once the food was served. She totally kicked ass from soup through the first round of fish but when it came time for the AYCE portion she was nowhere to be found.Overall the food was good and certainly much better than our previous visit. The meal was slightly above average, but I would certainly have liked some bread. The service was also good overall, and the ambiance is fairly nice.

As I finished the cup of chowder I was wishing I had some but tried to put it out of my mind as I waited for the fish which arrived about 10 minutes later. The perch were served as four small sized butterflies which amounted to eight filets. The fish tasted very good and had a light, yet firm batter which was decent but not super flavorful. It could definitely have used a little more salt but was still very good and a fine value at 12 bucks.I managed to sneak a piece of the cod as well and it was much better than the last time but still was not great. It had a light batter but the fish was not really flaky and almost felt mushy. It was not bad but looked like it should have been better. Much like the perch it didn’t have a real distinct flavor which was kind of a bummer. I will also caveat this by saying that I didn’t get a scalding hot piece which may have been better. The accompanying items were all good and rounded out the meal well. The straight cut style fries were very good as were the curly fries which several folks around the table got. The tartar also helped the fish even though there was clearly a hint of dill, it was practically unnoticeable. One thing that was noticeable was how great our waitress was when we were ordering and how absent she was once the food was served. She totally kicked ass from soup through the first round of fish but when it came time for the AYCE portion she was nowhere to be found.Overall the food was good and certainly much better than our previous visit. The meal was slightly above average, but I would certainly have liked some bread. The service was also good overall, and the ambiance is fairly nice. Babe’s has done a good job revamping their establishment and putting out an inoffensive Fish Fry for a fair price.www.babesmadison.com5614 Schroeder RoadMadison, WI 53711     (608) 274-7300",3157,0.23471978021978013,0.4670989010989011

Brats and beer - the perfect combo, the tailgating standard, the essence of the Wi-Life. It all makes sense, and when the Brat und Brau opened in the Northgate Shopping Center I knew it wouldnt be long before we paid them a visit. Unfortunately, since Fish Fry is my thing, we went on a Friday which meant skipping the brats in favor of the fried cod. Fisch und Brau just doesnt have the same ring to it, and perhaps fittingly since it was nowhere near as good as a brat would have been.For starters the BuB serves their Fish Fry all day every day, but charges a whopping $13 for it. While $13 isnt totally alarming depending on the setup, when you consider the portion at the Brau its a little silly. While the brats are ridiculously large and overflow the normal-sized buns, the fish comes in a scant 3-piece. The cod was pure and flaky, but the batter had no flavor whatsoever. Zip. Zero. Zilch. It could well have been just plain old flour with nothing else to add any interest. Despite the dullness it was gone in an instant since the portion was so petite. Usually Sysco tartar is merely an acceptable addition to a Fish Fry, but in this instance it was the fishs saving grace. The single Solo bathed the common cod in tartar-y zippiness and buried the bland fish with real flavor. Cottage is the name of the potato game at the Brau house and the freezer-fresh fries were fine, but nothing special, and could have been fried a bit longer (I had a couple limpies mixed in with my batch). A plain old dinner roll also didnt do much, but was at least there (for $13 it damn well should be). Maybe it was simply because everything else was sort of boring, or maybe it was actually good, but the BuB slaw stood out. It was a creamy and colorful rendition that appeared to be made in-house. It had a nice zest, but as I say, it may have just seemed that way because everything else was just kind boring. If this Fish Fry was more in the $8 price range I could see possibly recommending it, but at $13 ($11 after 5pm on Friday) theres just no way. Overall, I dont recommend this Fish Fry and will certainly be having a brat if and when we come back. Its definitely a bummer since this area could really use a go-to Fish Fry, and the Brat und Brau had a chance to stake its claim. I guess well have to settle for go-to big brats and leave it at that. www.bratundbrau.com/2933 N Sherman AveMadison, WI 53704     (608) 257-2186",2491,0.03046874999999999,0.47202380952380957

The first is high quality fish. Fresh is the best, but that can be hard to find in these parts, so as long as you can get a good, meaty hunk that was frozen ASAP youre usually going to be alright. The second is potatoes made with care. While crinkle-cut fries from the freezer usually suffice, a fresh-cut potato or homemade potato pancake really gives a Fish Fry a leg-up. Third is homemade tartar sauce. This is pretty self-explanatory -- Kraft just doesnt cut the mustard. Fourth is rye bread. While most places trot out a simple dinner roll (or nothing at all) those that step up to the rye set themselves apart even further. And last is fresh, homemade coleslaw. Seems simple enough, right? Youd be amazedThe Tap Room at Hawks Landing is one of the few places to figure the formula out and actually apply it each and every Friday. We showed up really early, and within 5 minutes of ordering had steaming hot plates of food in front of us. Since I had the perch on our last visit I decided to try the walleye to see if it was anywhere near as good. As I expected, it was. The single fillet was on the large side, although far from the largest Ive seen. It was well-fried, and incredibly flaky, so much so that I was forced to use a fork at times. Shame on me. The fish wore a thin breading that was fall-apart flaky, but held my attention with plenty of seasoning. The fish melded perfectly with its coating, and although it was fairly substantial it was gone in an instant. While Im not sure if the shoestring fries were cut in-house or not, I do know that they were crispy and delicious. They come with skin intact, are liberally salted, and plentiful. While the fries were fantastic, the tartar sauce fell flat, and while Im sure it was homemade, it really didnt keep my interest. The sauce was on the thin side and little too dilly for my tastes. It also had an odd shrimp-y flavor, and while I like a good scampi I dont want it anywhere near my Fish Fry. Rye bread is the lynchpin to any traditional Fish Fry and the FULL SLICE the Tap Room provides is a breath of fresh air. Its simply a great addition, and the main element that most places miss. Some coleslaw provides the final input to the equation, and while I like that its homemade, the bleu cheese that is lavishly applied to it makes it somewhat undesirable. It is unique, but damn, it is strange, and the only thing you end up tasting is the cheese and not the fresh slaw underneath it. Of course there was also a big old lemon wedge provided, and of course I wanted nothing to do with it. There are a few simple things that make for a great Fish Fry and if places can stick with them they are usually in the clear. Its the places that try to get too crafty, or deviate from this script that often fail on Fridays, and believe me there are plenty of them out there Luckily, the TR@HL isnt one of them. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and will definitely be back. taproomathawkslanding.com/Home.aspx88 Hawk's Landing CircleVerona, WI 53593     (608) 848-5751",3114,0.15965048840048843,0.47390923890923886

The first one we visited was the Klubhouse, which was average at best. The next was The Roost, which was marginally better, but still nothing to write home about. We were starting to think that the swanky Westside clubhouse was destined for mediocrity and just not a place that wed ever come back to with any sort of regularity. Well, as they say, the third time is a charm, and the new Tap Room finally put a tee shot on the green.The Tap Room is easily the best Fish Fry to hit the Landing thus far. The revamped Friday menu features Wild-caught Alaskan Cod, Walleye (prepared three different ways), and Lake Erie Yellow Lake Perch (love the specificity). While they all sounded superb, and the fried walleye gave me pause, I instinctively went for the perch, and was very pleased with my decision. Fore!Our waitress was ultra-attentive and had our food ready in no time. It was very impressive considering how many people were there (it was much busier than The Roost or Klubhouse ever was), and clued us in to the how well things were flowing in the kitchen. From the fish, to the fries, to the dolled-up coleslaw, everything looked very nice. The four perch fillets cascaded over a mound of shoestring fries and appeared to be wild-caught as two fillets were large and two were smallish  it wasnt just huge homogeneous fillets as youd expect from the farm-raised varieties. All four were coated in beautiful breading that was thin, but still had a satisfying crunch. The bigger pieces were a tad fishier, while the little guppies were smooth and mild. The diversity covered the entire flavor spectrum, although the breading could have used a hint more seasoning. While some seasoning was visible, it seemingly fooled the eye, but the taste buds never lie. While the fish was well on its way it didnt quite get all the way there. The pile of potatoes underneath the fish were a McDonalds lovers dream. The shoestring-style spuds were practically clones of the famous golden fries, although these ones came with the skin on. While I did have a couple limp ones on the bottom they were great for the most part and a borderline-excellent potato option. After hitting 2/2 greens with the fish and fries I was a little dismayed when the tartar landed in the rough. The TR rendition was thin and a little heavy on the dill, and didnt make the fish better or worse, but did give it some lubrication. While it wasnt a hazard to be avoided, it wasnt a smooth out, and didnt add any length to the drive. A lot of places make it to the green in one, but never birdie that Par 3. The Tap Room brings their short game with the Fish Fry and put in that putt with a full slice of rye bread. The rye was soft and fresh, although served with non-spreadable cold butter. Oh well, it still went down. Coleslaw is basically the chipping game of the Fish Fry. While it seems really straight-forward it is actually anything but, and can be the downfall of your round. There is a subtly to the slaw that takes time to figure out, and if you try to get too fancy it can screw up your whole game. The Taps rendition was of the homemade variety and had a good flavor, but certainly wasnt the zestiest out there. In addition, it had bleu cheese crumbled on top which wasnt bad per se, but was just kind of odd. While the moldy member made it unique, Im not sure it was in a good way. It was nice to finally get a round in that we could be proud of in at Hawks Landing. The Tap Room is just what this place needed and just the kind of place that will keep us coming back. Overall, we highly recommend the lake perch at the Tap Room, and think its probably the best fish weve ever had a golf-related establishment. Even Shooter McGavin would be proud. Full disclosure: We know the new restaurant manager, Patrick, personally although it didnt appear we received any special treatment because of the affiliation. taproomathawkslanding.com/Home.aspx88 Hawk's Landing CircleVerona, WI 53593     (608) 848-5751",4127,0.19513696215400766,0.5387117112685291

And why wouldnt she? The place is geared towards her - inoffensive grub at reasonable prices with very few surprises. Its the kind of place for those who want comfort food, bottomless cups of coffee, and a counter where they can sit and BS with their friends all morning long. Unfortunately, Im not one of those people. At least not yet.I rolled into the DFR around noon after a failed attempt at Rudes Lanes (not sure if Rudes is closed for good or were just closed this Friday, but either way their awning was gone). Since it was noon there were plenty of open booths, but the counter was fairly busy which thwarted my attempt to eat up there. I took a quiet booth that was kind of out of the way, and had a waitress there to help me within a few seconds  she was great. There are a few options on the special Friday section of the menu including: beer battered walleye or cod (the cod comes AYCE on Friday), and a Smelt Fry. While I was interested in the walleye (had it not been beer battered), when its billed as a Smelt Fry I just can resist it for some reason, so thats where my $9 went. The smelt also comes with a soup/salad option (but no coleslaw) and since it was Friday I went for the clam chowder over a house salad. The chowder came lickity-split and started the meal off well. It was on the creamy side, but had as much corn in it as clam, which seems to be a theme in DeForest (these folks love their corn). It went down quickly along with a couple stale-ish House Recipe crackers, and no sooner had I set the spoon down than the smelt showed up. There were three dishes in all (besides the soup): a plate with the smelt and sauces, one with hash browns with cheese and onion ($0.99 extra for the cheese), and a little bowl of corn. There were a good 15 smelt on the plate and I wasted no time going after them. Each one was smothered in an abundant batter that really masked the fish. It was a little too thick for my tastes and accounted for at least 1/3 of each fishs total mass. The batter also lacked any discernable seasoning which is sorta what you come to expect at family restaurant kind of places. The portion was ample and the fish was inoffensive, but when youre talking Fish Fry unique batter is the name of the game and the DFR played it a little too safe. The smelt was also very fishy tasting which is what you expect so if you dont like that essence youd best just stay away altogether.Diner-style places usually know what they are doing when it comes to hash browns and the DFR is no different. The cheddar-laden spuds were adequately fried and came in a big portion, but were nothing really special, although perfectly acceptable. The tartar was also acceptable, although about as basic as you are going to find. It had a nice consistency and visible relish, but not much zing. A side of cocktail sauce also came with the smelt, but keeping with the theme was kind of bland, and much more ketchup-y than horseradish-y. If nothing else it at least picked up the slack when the tartar ran out. Not only was there no slaw with the Smelt Fry, but there was no bread either! While I like dont mind a side of canned corn and some corny clam chowder it certainly isnt a substitute for my bread and slaw. Add-ons are always welcome at a Fish Fry, but not in lieu of the staples, and bread and slaw are as stapled as you can get. While I really wanted to like this Fish Fry I just cant fully endorse it. The food was fine, but I cant help but feel like this is really more of breakfast place than a fish place. Overall, we dont recommend the Smelt Fry at the DeForest Family Restaurant and probably wouldnt come back for it. www.deforestfamilyrestaurant.com/505 W North StreetDeForest, WI 53532     (608) 846-6910",3811,0.14264487276392035,0.4795389266817837

It wasnt to see the river, or (as hard as it might be to believe) to partake in their Civil War reenactment. Our goal was much more focused; it was to visit a tiny bar near the train tracks and eat what we were told was an amazing Fish Fry. We tried it, it was delicious, and our goal was accomplished.On that day two year ago the fish was cod (or at least we presumed it was) but today it happened to be haddock. Since its not Madison, and its not a supper club, the fish at the Friendly Tavern is cheap. The 3-piece runs around eight bucks and with a beer barely reaches double digits. Since we were on the backend of lunch the fish fried alarmingly quickly and was hot, hot, hot! Being the overzealous sort, I jumped on the pile and damn near burned my mouth in the process. The fish was good, but not as alluring as the rendition we enjoyed so much previously. The fish was light and flaky, but had a little grease on its belly which makes me think the fryer wasnt at full blast so long after lunch. When haddock or cod is the canvass of choice the batter needs to be brilliant and last time it was. This go round is was on the dark side and while it wasnt burnt it wasnt far off. While the fish wasnt as great as that of our memory the fries were every bit as amazing. The thick, house-cut spuds were well-seasoned and perfectly fried. Most fries cant compare to those from the county fair of our youth, but these are not far behind. Simple starchy perfection. Warm tartar sauce can be a death sentence for a Fish Fry, but somehow the big squeeze bottle at they leave on the table at the Friendly remains tasty. Its zesty and thick enough to drown the grease on the fish completely. The slaw was creamy, but not really noteworthy, while the slice of marble rye was very meritorious. It came slathered with melted butter and really gave the meal an edge that is sorely needed. Portage isnt exactly Madison-adjacent, but when youre heading north a Fish Fry at the Friendly isnt too far out of the way. While Id have a hard time convincing myself to take the trek otherwise it is certainly a worthwhile pit stop when youre heading that way. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and think it still has a lot going for it even if the fish itself is a little up and down. www.facebook.com/pages/Friendly-Tavern/211680755573098223 W Oneida StreetPortage, WI 53901     (608) 745-3355",2460,0.1980050505050504,0.5438672438672438

I mean, dont get me wrong, I love bars, but Madison has plenty of its own, and most of them are better than anything you are going to find in small-town Wisconsin. Of course, not all bars in Madison serve Fish Fry, and of those that do only a handful really do it justice. So, when I hear of a bar that is out of the way that has a great Fish Fry I really take notice (and once in a while Ill actually pay them a visit). The Friendly Tavern in Portage is just such a place.In all honesty I may never have driven to Portage to get fish, but we had a wedding to attend at Castle Rock Lake and the Friendly was pretty much on the way so I decided what the hell? We rolled up to the nook of building around 1pm and made our way inside without much acclaim. The place was pretty much dead, but the lone waitress was still attentive and came right over. I ordered a 3-piece and a Spotted Cow in a single breath, and saw the cook joyfully hop from his barstool to the kitchen to get things going. The Cow was crisp and cold, and within 5 minutes my fish was ready. Game on! Things at the FT are cheap ($7.00 for a 3-piece cod and $6.00 for 2-piece), but that doesnt mean theyre cutting corners. Each chunk of cod was thick and meaty with an incredibly light texture. It was paired with a thin and crispy coating that complimented the fish without overwhelming it. It was expertly fried and while the batter could have used a hint more salt, thats a pretty petty critique. It was great fish, and dare I say superbly superb. The French fries were also ample, and were cut in-house (which I love). It was basically a whole large potato, julienned, and again, expertly fried. The spuds looked as good as they tasted and lasted throughout the fish (and then some). A big squeeze bottle of tartar sat atop the long bar when we arrived and about half of it remained upon our departure. I used a ton of the thick and creamy sauce because 1) it was there, and 2) I had plenty of fries to sop it up. While it was mostly mayo there was plenty of relish to keep it interesting, with its only real downfall was the fact that is wasnt chilled. Cold tartar > room-temp tartar.Usually if a bar can get the fish, fries, and tartar right (and only charge me seven skins while doing so) Ill chalk it up as a win, but the Friendly folks take things a step further. They heap on a big old bowl of homemade slaw with the gooey texture you love and zip you crave, as well as a thick half-slice of marble rye. I found myself gleefully scooping the slaw onto that fat little sucker and living the Fish Fryers dream. It was simply glorious. The marble rye was plush, and while I could easily have eaten a full slice, it was thick enough that even a halfer was satisfying. While I normally wouldnt drive 50 miles out of my way to go to a bar, the Fish Fry at the Friendly Tavern in Portage may have just changed all of that. It was nothing less than spectacular, especially when you consider the teensy-weensy price tag. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and will likely be coming up with excuses to go to Portage here on out... I hear they do a wicked Civil War Reenactment, and the downtown walking tour is a must! ;)  www.facebook.com/pages/Friendly-Tavern/211680755573098223 W Oneida StreetPortage, WI 53901     (608) 745-3355",3382,0.1334825195901145,0.5690265220012055

From the diner down the street, to the dive bar up it, theyre going to have fish, especially on Friday. Now and then youll even find places that have a Fish Fry every day of the week - the Daisy Café & Cupcakery on Atwood Avenue is one of these places.Even though the Daisy Fish Fry is served every day of the week we found ourselves there on a Friday since it was just the wife and I knew theyd have a plethora of options for the little veggie. Not surprisingly, they werent very busy this Friday although there were a few tables occupied. We got a 2-person setup right in the middle of the room and sat back to see which of the two waiters would eventually mosey our way. It was solid 5 minutes before one of them appeared, but he was very friendly and punctual after that so well give him the benefit of the doubt. I, of course, ordered the fish, and it was ready in about 15 minutes. The $11 2-piece cod was of Bering Sea lineage, and came with a side of garlic-parmesan potatoes, some homemade fiesta slaw, and a cup of house-made tartar. The Panko-crusted cod was pan-fried as advertised, and was surprisingly meaty, but didnt taste fresh. While the fish was adequately flaky, the breading lacked seasoning which made it uninteresting. I dont want this to sound rude, but it was like eating a gourmet fish stick - both in flavor and consistency. While it wasnt terrible, it wasnt something Id necessarily come back for. The garlicky red potatoes were clearly made in house, but were haphazardly smashed instead of mashed. Despite the cheese and garlic, the spuds craved salt and pepper which I applied liberally. Like they fish, the potatoes were fine, but I would honestly take crinkle fries any day. House-made tartar can be hit and miss, but luckily the Daisy sauce found the mark. The house-made marvel was thick and rich, and covered up most of the flaws in the fish. The slaw followed a similar trajectory in that it was made from scratch, however the bountiful bowlful wasnt what I was after. If Im being honest (and I always try to be) the homemade mix lacked zest and actually tasted a little dirty. While I ate a lot of it, it was more out of need than want as there just wasnt that much food on the plate. There was also no bread to supplement it so that probably explains why I was hungry enough to put the bulk of it down. If there is a saving grace for the Daisy Café and Cupcakery it is right there in the name. Since dinner was somewhat disappointing we allowed ourselves to splurge on some cupcakes, and they were nothing less than superb. The variety of cakes was impressive and the execution was flawless. They were easily some of the best cupcakes weve ever had, and we even went back a couple days later to get some more. This is a tough one because the Cupcakery is a neat place and I really wanted to like the fish, but it just didnt come together. While the wife loved the veggie burrito, and the desserts were divine, the fish fell flat. Overall, we dont recommend this Fish Fry, but do recommend the establishment as a whole. Go for the breakfasts, go for the cupcakes, but skip the fish, especially on Friday. www.daisycafeandcupcakery.com2827 Atwood AvenueMadison, WI 53704     (608) 241-2200",3312,0.1350701530612245,0.4914739229024942

Im not sure exactly why I like them so much, but I do. Perhaps its because thats what I grew up with. Or, perhaps its that theres always a stool or two available (unlike some places in the city). Or, perhaps (and most likely) its that small town bars usually have great fish on Fridays without overdoing it or drawing too much attention to themselves. Yes, thats almost certainly why I like small-town bars, they love making Fish Frys and I love eating em. Its a match made in heaven.I heard of this small-town bar called Marcines a while ago, but only recently decided I needed to pay them a visit. Rumor had it their fish was good, and since our friends Zach and Stacy recently moved into the area I figured we might as well rendezvous in Mt. Vernon and see what was what. We showed up around 7 and grabbed a drink at the bar; they rolled in around 7:15, and things got underway. There were plenty of tables available so we just grabbed a round one big enough to accommodate our crew of six. The waitress (who looked like she didnt want to be there one bit) came over a few minutes later and sauntered off to get us some more drinks. As you might expect, the Friday menu at Marcines isnt exactly expansive, but does feature the usual suspects of cod and walleye. The cod comes as either a 2 or 3-piece ($7.50, and $9.50 respectively), while the single walleye filet goes for $11. Both fish come with your choice of potato and literally everyone in our party went for the Cowboy over the fries or baked potato. Yeehaw! Before the fish, the coleslaw hit the table. It was an interesting blend that was indeed creamy, but more sour-creamy than mayo-creamy. While it wasnt awful, it wasnt alluring in any way and pretty much everyone agreed that it was middle-of-the-road as far as slaws go. It took quite a while for the fish to show up after that which made me (justifiably) uneasy. It was at least 20 minutes, and (of course) the fish was warm, but not steaming hot when it arrived. It looked (and tasted) like it had sat for a bit. If nothing else, the portion of fish was large. For your nine-fifty you get three fat chunks of cod, in a light, flaky breading. The breading had a decent flavor, but definitely could have used some more seasoning. While it was light it was too waifish, and didnt cling to the fish very well. The chubby chunks of cod were flaky, but sort of watery which partially contributed to the breading not clinging. By and large it was fine fish, more the get it down while its still warm kind than the savor every bite kind. When the waitress described the Cowboy potatoes they really sounded like something special (which is probably why every single one of us ordered them). In reality it was basically a hash brown casserole with cheese and onion, which actually would have been totally fine had they not been served cold. Seriously, cold potatoes. Yikes. The 3-piece cod comes with two small Solo cups of tartar sauce instead of just one (which is smart thinking on Marcines part). The sauce appeared to be of the homemade variety, and was very thick. It was definitely a unique blend that I think was made with McCormick mayo instead of the usual Hellmans or Sysco. This particular mayo has a very interesting flavor (if youve ever had it you know what Im talking about) which isnt horrible, but just doesnt do it for me. It also didnt have much relish mixed in which led to it being a pretty basic tartar. Rounding out the plate was a dinner roll that was yummy in every way. It was soft and crusty, with a delicious yeasty flavor. It was definitely not just your plain dinner roll, and partially made up for some shortcomings elsewhere in the meal. As I said, I really like small-town bars, and Marcines in Mt. Vernon is no exception. The bar itself is neat, and while this wasnt the best fish Ive ever had, it was passable and had everything come out scalding hot it could have been a different story altogether. Overall, we still recommend this Fish Fry and will likely come back someday to give them a chance to fully redeem themselves. There are better days ahead at Marcines. I just know it.  www.facebook.com/pages/Marcines/1428981857716308646 Davis StreetMt. Horeb, WI 53572     (608) 832-6289",4291,0.1371734557276726,0.49637167718493014

These are words to live by, yet so few of us actually subscribe to this simple philosophy. Buck & Badger sure didnt, but certainly should have.The first time we went to B&B it was exemplary. From the food to the service, everything blew us away and we could hardly wait to come back. This time around it was a totally different story, and we left feeling disappointed and underwhelmed.Instead of the haddock we were expecting our $14 went towards cod and while it arrived quickly it wasnt scalding hot like it should have been. White it wasnt cold or anything like that it definitely wasnt in the zone. Like the haddock we enjoyed previously the cod came as one large piece, and while it was flaky for the most part, there was some slickness between the fish and the batter. The batter itself was on the thick side, but since it was substantial it actually held up to the chunky cut of cod.The skin-on fries were also not as impressive this time around as the portion had a lot of nubs and not as many full-cuts. It lead to a lot of pinching instead of plucking, which doesnt mean the world, but when Im paying $14 itd be nice to at least get a continent or two.  The tartar was also disappointing as the mix was on the thin-side and lacked the zip we were expecting. It was good enough to make the fish more palatable, but simply couldnt take it over the top like it did on our last visit. On our previous trip the rye was grilled to perfection, but this time around it was all over the place. Some parts were charred while other corners were still raw. It was somewhat strange and certainly not the righteous rye we remembered. We were also expecting more from the slaw based on our previous experience, but this scoop missed the mark. It was more bland than anticipated, but at least had the same consistency as the old slaw. So theres that We really dont have any explanation for what happened on this visit to Buck & Badger and would definitely not have been back if this is what we would have gotten the first time around. Overall, we dont recommend this Fish Fry, but will likely come back for the rubber match at some point to see if they rebound. Hopefully this Fry was just a bad showing, and the haddock we had the first time is the rule and not the exception, but at this point were not really sure what to think. buckandbadger.com115 State StreetMadison, WI 53703     (608) 230-7999",2440,0.04762321012321015,0.4411555062870851

Whether its finding a dollar on the ground or getting a greeting card in the mail from an old friend, we all love the thrill of the unexpected. Its these little things that really make life enjoyable, and keep us seeking the perfect Fish Fry. You just never know when you might get a big surprise, and lo and behold, Buck & Badger gave us one.Gabe was back in town and we had a large group, so even though it was after 8:00 we still had to wait for a bit while the friendly hostess got a big booth together for us. It wasnt a problem though since a pitcher of Schlitz only costs ten bucks at B&B and we were already feeling pretty good from a little time on the Terrace. Eventually we got our booth, and had our orders into our lip-pieced waiter in no time (at least it seemed like no time, the pitcher of Optimator at the Union may have had something to do with that though). The Friday Fish Fry at Buck & Badger features a $14 haddock fillet complete with all the usual trimmings. The surprises started right away as the fish showed up in no time, delivered in pristine shape by our thoughtful college-aged server. The haddock came in a single chunk and was surprisingly large. The fat, meaty fillet was also surprisingly tasty with mammoth planes of flaky, white meat and no grease whatsoever. The fish had a great flavor, and paired nicely with the B&B batter that wasnt light by any means, but didnt need to be since the fish was so robust. I will say that the beer-infused coating could have used a little more seasoning, but we were all surprised at how well it paired with the hearty haddock. Our fish rode in on a steed of starches, but unfortunately the homespun fries were under-cooked. While the portion was princely, they were sort of mushy, but still salty and delicious. Their lackluster frying was a bit of a surprise since the fish was done perfectly, and usually if a place does the fish well, the fries follow suit. Oh well. I guess you cant win em all. A thick and creamy tartar bolstered the lineup, and really put the fish in its place. It was a welcome addition with the zip you want and flavor you crave. Although I was a little surprised when the bill showed up and the second cup cost me an extra $0.50. The surprises just kept on coming with the slaw which turned out to be some of the best weve ever had. It was creamy and zesty, with a sweetness that really kept you coming back for more. It was also an eye-catching mix, with two kinds of cabbage and plenty of carrot to pretty it up. A full slice of grilled rye rounded out the plate and surprised everyone with its size. Normally places skimp on the rye (or simply phase it out altogether), but the Buck bucked that trend. The slice was hearty and stanky, and provided the perfect contrast to the sweet slaw. The fish was huge and tasty, the fries were under-fried but well-salted, the tartar hit the mark, the slaw was simply superb, and the rye was totally radical. It was the full Fish Fry experience, and while we were all pleased there was still one more big surprise coming - chocolate chip cookies! Buck & Badger, you are one sly dog (or other woodland creature, as it were). Going into a Fish Fry with low expectations is an easy way to keep yourself from being disappointed, but it also puts you in a position for a big surprise should it be something special. While the fish at Buck & Badger wasnt necessarily something special, it was the full meal deal and definitely a welcome surprise. Overall, this Fish Fry is a borderline highly recommendable, and one we will definitely be coming back for.

Its really a great little place, and features some pretty smoking deals from time to time. The staff is among the friendliest you are ever going to find, and the owners genuinely seem to appreciate your business. Their raw meat selection is impressive and Ive had the privilege to sample several different items from their display cases. Bacon? Booyah! Sausage? Sure thing! Brats? Bees knees! Fish Fry? Forget about it No, literally, skip the fishFor being a meat market/deli Jims has a fairly expansive carry-out menu, which includes a daily Fish Fry. Whenever I hear a Fish Fry is served every day I take note since that usually means something. That something is often pre-battered fish, standard Sysco sides, and an underwhelming meal.  Unfortunately, that is exactly what Jimmy delivered. I opted for the $9.99 4-piece dinner over the much cheaper 2-piece basket since I was pretty hungry and wanted to give Jims every opportunity to prove themselves (no bread or slaw comes with the basket and those are part of my ranking system). I love the smell of a butcher shop and blissfully waited the five or so minutes while the fish was frying. I adored the aroma so much that almost pained me to leave once the food was actually ready, but leave I did since I wanted to get the fish home as hot as possible I made it in under four minutes. The big Styrofoam container contained a bevy of fried delights, including the four pre-battered cod fillets. The pieces were decent sized, but had the typical freezer-2-fryer flavor  if youve ever had this kind of fish you know exactly what Im talking about. While it isnt horrible per se, its certainly not flaky and lush, and doesnt come close to a freshly battered fillet. The fish was enveloped by a thick, crisp crust, which had minimal flavor and made the cod mushy rather than flaky. While it was marginally acceptable, it was far from the ideal, and the kind of fish you end up tasting all day long. *burp* The fish split its side of the foil lined foam container with a handful of Jims regular fries (waffle and wedges were also available). The fries were crispy and delicious, and out of a similar bag as the fish, so Im presuming it was Sysco all around. Still, not bad.The two small Solo cups of tartar were also likely of the Sysco sort and a little too dilly for my liking. While the sauce was thick and creamy, the relish dominated the flavor, and didnt bolster the fish the way it needed to. A piece of what appeared to be Italian bread rode atop the fry pile and was a little stale on the edges. The slaw showed improvement with its creamy substrate and subtle horseradish aftertaste. Id like to try the slaw again, the bread, not so much. This is a tough call because I really love the place itself, but Jims Fish Fry is just nothing special. Overall, I cant recommend this Fish Fry, and will definitely not be coming back for it any time soon. I will however come back any time Im in need of brats or double-smoked bacon. Jim really knows those meats. The Fish Fry? Not so much.  www.jimsofmadison.com1436 Northport DriveMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-8600",3187,0.12276264245014247,0.5234991859991859

If you dont, it was way out on Fish Hatch and had some pretty good food (especially the namesake Paella). The Spanish themed restaurant closed up shop quite a while ago now, and the building has seemingly remained vacant since then (although a restaurant or two may actually have occupied it since then, I really have no idea). Regardless, a new place has (finally) moved in and is offering a similar kind of menu, but this time with the requisite Wisconsin Fish Fry that La Paella never had. Veranda is the new kid on the (extremely long, semi-rural) block, and we decided to pay them a visit after seeing their Fish Fry listed on their Facebook page. We showed up early (having a pregnant wife will do that to you), and got a huge booth right near the bar (we could have visited the hostess station and got a table in the one of the dining rooms, but the big booth caught our eye so we just went with it). One of the troop of waiters came over not long after and was off instantly to get us a round of beers (the root variety for the lady). When he came back with the suds, he took our orders, and shortly after brought us a plate of bread with whipped butter. The French slices were soft and smooth, and capped off nicely by the equally velvety spread. The fish arrived not long after that, and looked pretty. While it wasnt bountiful by any means it definitely had the look. For sixteen bucks you get six pieces of fish, a surprisingly small allotment of fries, some house-made slaw, and a ramekin of sauce (notice I didnt say tartar sauce). The perch fillets varied in size, but were all on the small side. They were high quality, and the fish itself was spot on, but the breading missed the mark. It definitely showed promise as it was light and really clung to the fish, but it had no, and I mean zero, flavor of its own. It was a letdown since the perch was pristine, but just needed a little something to give it a boost and the breading didnt deliver. The pittance of fries were actually really good, and clearly cut in-house. They were double-fried (frites style), and seemed like theyd be boring, but were uniquely delicious. They offered a great contrast in textures thanks to a thin, crispy exterior, and a marvelously plush, lovable interior. They were unexpectedly great, but I definitely wanted (a lot) more. Sitting in for the tartar was a remoulade of sorts which, like the fish, had very little flavor of its own. It had a decidedly pinkish hue, but no taste to go along with captivating color. Whereas the perch was plain, and the sauce was simple, the finely-shredded slaw was incredibly diverse. Unfortunately diversity doesnt always translate to deliciousness with coleslaw and this mix had too much dill and what appeared to be bleu cheese. While the portion was ample, it didnt taste great, so the bounty wasnt necessarily a good thing. There were also a bunch of chives sprinkled here and there throughout the plate, which made everything look fancy, but didnt add much (if anything) to the meal. La Paella was a good restaurant, but didnt make the grade out in Fitchburg for whatever reason. While Id like to say Veranda wont fall victim to a similar fate Im afraid I just cant do it. The food was okay, but there wasnt anything special about it to draw us back in, and the $16 price tag certainly doesnt help matters. Overall, we dont recommend this Fish Fry, and fear that life on the Veranda might be short lived. www.verandamadison.com2784 S Fish Hatchery RoadFitchburg, WI 53711     (608) 661-4161",3569,0.17419145606645606,0.526749297999298

Since it was a lovely Friday afternoon and the family was up for a drive (this means the baby was asleep, fyi) we decided to take the jaunt down I-94 and see just how worth it it is. Of course, by some stroke of amazing luck they werent doing their normal Fish Fry this Friday due to a member appreciation night so that put the kibosh on our plans to review their fish. We were a little agitated, but instead of getting angry we simply took the highway back towards Madison and found our way to the Aztalan Inn where the fish is always frying and the salad bar is made fresh every Friday.The AI has a few fish choices on Friday and since Id bitten into their bluegill and picked the perch previously I decided to chomp on their cod for a change. All the fish comes with a trip through the pool-table-topped salad bar so thats where we began our journey. While all the salads on the bar are fresh and made in house there is no actual lettuce to speak of. Instead I opted for: the cottage cheese which was what youd expect it to be, the beet salad which was sweet and creamy, the seven layer salad which was basically a taco dip, and the coleslaw which was finely-chopped and creamy. All of the salads were quite good and I imagine those I wasnt able to sample were as well. A variety of white rolls are also available on the salad barl and the plain one I took was fresh and squishy. Chalk it up as a win. The fish showed up not long after we circumnavigated the pool table and was smoldering hot. It featured the same cornmeal style breading that comes on the ocean perch which is delightfully crunchy, but not incredibly flavorful. The cod itself was flaky and pure, but it really needed a special breading to take it over the top and since it wasnt there the total package was pretty basic. For being a small bar the Inn has plenty of sides to choose from and this time around we got to sample the potato pancakes and the sweet potato fries. The cakes cost an extra buck but are hearty and come with a side of maple syrup for dipping. They were clearly homemade and looked like three little hash brown patties, but tasted rich and oniony like a good latke should. The sweet potato fries were also thick and hearty and outstanding in their own right. With four pieces of fish on the plate a single serving of tartar wasnt up to the task so of course we asked for another and the waitress was happy to oblige. We gladly sopped up the thick and creamy sauce since the cod basically begged for it. It was the perfect fishining touch.The old saying goes when life gives you lemons, make lemonade. Likewise, when Milford Hills gives you their member appreciation night, make your way to Aztalan, which is exactly what we did. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and wish there were more places like the Aztalan Inn for us to visit.

This week I just assumed it was lake perch since I was the reputable Aztalan Inn, and they definitely wound up making an ass out me. In reality I should have known better since the menu said five fillets for $10.95, but for some reason it just didnt resonate with me. I guess I figured it was just a big time deal at the small town bar, but as soon as the bartender set my plate in front of me I knew Id been had. To be fair, this stuff was still pretty great (at least as far as ocean perch goes). It was flaky, and moist, and absolved by a truly superb cornmeal breading. It has to be the best perch Ive had other than the Esquire Clubs, but the difference is the Esquires perch is AYCE and at Aztalan its just the five chunks. Oh well, while it was definitely no lake perch, it wasnt saline tasting or overly fishy like some OP can be. Potato pancakes are also listed on the menu, but of course arent available until dinner time. I was resigned to one of the three French fry options (plain, seasoned, battered), and settled on the seasoned this time around. Thankfully, the seasoned spuds were simply scrumptious, starting with a satisfying crunch and ending with a fluffy finish. No need for ketchup here, Mrs. Bar Lady. Since it was ocean perch a good tartar was mandatory and the AI delivered. The 2 oz. cup of homemade sauce was thick and creamy, with plenty of decent sized chunks in it. The perch sopped up every iota of it, and the cup was wiped completely clean by the end. The slaw came in a bigger 4 oz. cup, although it was only about 2 oz. full. Unfortunately for yours truly, it was a finely-chopped and zesty rendition, which really made me wish all 4 ounces would have made it in. Last and probably least was the dinner roll which was fine, but featured a crust that basically flaked right off. It seemed like it might have been a little stale, but its hard to say for sure if it was old or just made that way. Regardless, it was tempered by a generous dose of room-temp butter and got gobbled up along with everything else on the plate. While this definitely wasnt the lake perch I was hoping for, most of the blame falls on me for not clarifying what was on the menu, or trusting my instincts (I almost went walleye). Overall, we still recommend this Fish Fry and it serves as a testament to how good the Aztalan Inn really is. Any place that can make ocean perch taste this good clearly knows what they are doing, and if this is their worst fish I can only imagine how good their best is.  aztalaninn.comW6630 County Road BLake Mills, WI 53551     (920) 648-3206",2789,0.1730411255411255,0.5215656565656566

Its out of the way, its small yet surprisingly spacious, it has bartenders that treat you like a regular even if its your first time stepping foot in the door, and it has that certain flair that you only find in a small-town bar. The Aztalan Inn simply has it, which, of course, means they also have a spectacular Fish Fry The real it.The Friday Fish Fry at the AI starts at 11:00, but if you bide your time until 2:00 or so you can help yourself to their salad bar at no additional charge and a whale of a salad bar it is. While it isnt the largest spread youre going to find, every single item on it is topnotch (at least those I sampled anyway). It features mostly salads, but the customary cottage cheese is there too (there is even chocolate pudding!). The salad mix was crisp and fresh, the coleslaw was finely chopped and perfectly zesty, the small-curd cottage cheese was yummy, and the purple noodle stuff I mistakenly took for an alternative slaw was unique and delicious. I managed to save the pudding for dessert and what a treat it turned out to be after plowing down a pile of fried perfection. In addition to all the options on the bountiful bar there are a ton of fish to choose from and I settled on the 5-piece bluegill for $11. Even though I was wolfing the salad down the fish arrived before I made it through and I was forced to push the greens and company aside. The main attraction was literally buried under a huge pile of steak fries which necessitated some serious spud crunching in order to get a grip on the bite-sized bluegill. While the portion of bluegill was kinda skimpy, each and every member was great. They were dredged in a light, and I mean light, cornmeal breading with some seasoning, but not much. The muted breading really let the taste of the fish come through, which was so appealing I could easily have eaten a good 5 (if not 10) more fillets. The fries come in three flavors and I chose the battered over the plain or seasoned varieties. As I mentioned, there were a pantload of the Tobys-style spuds and each was a little morsel of heaven. They were very crispy, and a few clung together which formed a sort of fry fence here and there. Even so, the batter buddies were expertly fried and simply delicious, especially when interspersed with bites of the flaky fish. Any Fish Fry worth its salt is going to trot out a thick and creamy tartar and the folks in Aztalan clearly know the drill. This stuff was like Portland cement and clung to fish with reckless abandon. It had just enough relish to keep it interesting and I used every drop, but mostly with the fries since the fish was gone in the blink of an eye. The rolls were also found on the salad bar and were crustier and denser than your average dinner roll. They played the part, but didnt bowl me over (but then again, they didnt have to). If you are willing to take the drive out to Aztalan, believe me you wont be disappointed. The AI is a great little place, and the kind of bar I have no problem hanging out in for extended periods of time (I wound up being there for almost 3 hours).

Its not fancy, or trying to do too much, its just straight-forward fried fish with a few sides. Some people love this kind of Fish Frywhich explains why Murphys Bar & Restaurant is so busy every Friday.Murphys has three fish on the menu  each of them sharing the same beer batter. Since beer batter goes best with cod, thats what weve stuck with (sorry lake perch and walleye). It goes for $11 and comes plenty quickly as long as youre there before the rush. The cod is flaky and sports the aforementioned batter proudly. The coating is every bit of basic and while theres not much flavor to be found a rich and creamy sensation comes through. Texture-wise it falls somewhere in the middle  not too thick, but definitely not thin, which allows the coating to hold some grease. Its every bit of average, but in these parts inoffensive clearly sells. There are plenty of sides to choose from at Murphys and after seeing the waffles fries on a fellow diners plate we just had to try em. The spicy spuds were a very good rendition and while the portion was petite each individual was hearty so even a handful sufficed. While they werent Dexters Pub good, they werent too far behind. Thick and creamy tartar is a prerequisite with rich cod and Murphys plays the right tune here. It had all the thickness you want to go along with plenty of pep. The fish soaked up every last drop and a second cup would certainly have come in handy. Murphys homemade tartar kept the train rolling with a hint of horseradish and a little sugar to spice things up. A dinner roll on the side was a dinner roll, and thats that. Murphys has a pretty good thing going on and were happy to see them doing so well. Its literally one of the closest restaurants to our house and its nice that their Fish Fry is consistently good.

Since its close to our house we drive past the new Murphys fairly frequently and it didnt take long before we decided to pay them a visit, and boy, what a difference an owner can make. Having been to JJs TotS a few times we can say with confidence that it was never as busy as Murphys was this Friday night. The place was slammed with Waunakee and Madison locals alike, with waits for the dining room pushing an hour plus. We put our name on the list and crammed into the bar to get a drink. It was standing room only, but we eventually lucked into a couple stools at the bar at which point we took our name off the list since eating at the bar is kosher at Murphs place. A quick look over the menu, and a visit from the bartender had us on our way in short order. Everything on the Friday menu is beer battered and that includes the walleye and the lake perch. Since I know better than to order beer battered freshwater fish I stuck to the standard cod with a side of the not-so-standard hash browns with cheese and onion ($0.50 extra for the cheese). For being the new kid on the block Murphy is already slinging the fish, and our plates were ready in about 10 minutes. The plates featured (from left to right) two pieces of cod, a large cup of coleslaw, a small cup of tartar, and a dinner roll riding atop a rectangular cut of hash browns. I started in with the cod and expected a mouthful of steam, but was greeted with a lukewarm sensation. While the batter actually had a really good flavor, and the fish was flaky, it lost a lot of luster thanks to the low temps. I plowed through it quickly, but more out of necessity than desirability as I didnt want it to get any colder than it already was. In addition, the fact that you only get two pieces for your $11 doesnt make it a great value, and while I would  try it again I would hope for a fresher fry the next time around. On the other hand, the hash browns were nice and hot and tasted delightful. The cheese and onion blend that oozed through the shreds was done just right and really perked up the well-fried spuds. When fish is served lukewarm it needs a good pick-me-up, and Murphys provided one with their thick and creamy tartar sauce. The merciful mix took the fish where it needed to go helping make an overall pleasurable experience. The slaw was of the finely-chopped variety and offered a little zest, although it could have used even more. The portion was hearty, and like that tartar it pushed this Fish Fry in the right direction. The roll was a roll. No complains here. Perhaps its the fact that Murphys is brand new and everyone wants see what the new guy has to offer, or maybe its that there just arent many good Fish Frys in Waunkaee in general, but whatever it is everyone and their mother seemed to be there this Friday. While our dinner was a little hit-and-miss it seems like Murphys has a recipe for success that will keep drawing them in. Overall, we recommend the Fish Fry we had this trip and will surely be back for a round two before long.  5344 State Road 113Madison, WI 53704     (608) 249-0505",3625,0.12201648178210678,0.41396160263347764

I've made it my own little tradition, and it's a hell of a good one.Red Pines has a fish special on Friday, but it's walleye and shrimp, and while I like shrimp, I don't swing that way on Fridays. So, I stick to the lake perch (which is available every day) that comes either pan or deep fried...today I stuck to the stove-top. It's only $11.00 for a ""stringer-full"" of lake perch and it was easily worth every penny. They pan-fried perch stay a little firmer than their deep fried counterparts and maintain a lovely sheen throughout the meal. They are home to a light breading (which is apparently Mies brand) that really complements the subtle flavors of the fish well. While I know there is MSG in Mies, I also know I don't really care. It's superb stuff. The Pines fries have a lovely orange tint to them and are perfectly fried such that the crisp crunch is offset by their pillowy pototo-y innerds. Not many places can do it as consistently as RP does, but every time I've had these spicy buggers they have been spot on. Tartar is often overlooked at a Fish Fry. They're all the same after all, aren't they? That couldn't be further for the truth and a bad tartar can ruin a good fish. The Pine's smooth and zippy sauce is the opposite of that and takes the fish to the next plateau...some said it was Greenland, and some said Mexico. I decided it was nowhere except for excellent. All others were just guessing, wouldn't help you if they could. Since it's not a Friday special, there's not bred with the perch, which is a bit of a bummer, and while you can choose Texas toast as a side I'll be damned if I'm compromising my fries or slaw for gluten. Speaking of slaw, the vinegar-style stuff shakes things up in the best of ways. It's perfectly balanced with just enough caraway seed that one is bound to get one stuck in your teeth. It's a thoughtful blend and definitely adds a welcomes zest to the meal. Traditional sides win at Red Pines! Any Friday where you get to eat fish is a good Friday. A Friday where you get to eat fish AND play hockey is a great Friday, and when the fish is from Red Pines it's even better. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and only wish we could have it more than once a year.

Every year a group of guys from my hometown travel to Mankato, MN to play in a senior mens hockey tournament  its a tradition that started about six years ago and continues to this day. We drink, we skate, we have a good time BSing and reliving memories from way back when. Last year I made a stop at Red Pines Bar & Grill in Onalaska on my way over to the tourney and quickly realized a new tradition had been born. The Fish Fry at Red Pines is as tradition worthy as any out there, and even though the only fish on special is a haddock/shrimp combo there are lake perch and walleye on the everyday menu, both of which are quite special I their own right.The perch can be ordered pan or deep fried and my smorgasbord exited its hot oil bath in no time flat. For $12 eight perch fillets fill out the order and are simply phenomenal. The perch is as flaky as they come and home to a crispy breading with sensational seasoning. Its salty and robust and really hard keep your hands off of. A side of crispy battered fries accompany the fish and are excellent as well. Crunchy exteriors offset the plush potatoes perfectly and feature a zesty curly fry style seasoning. A cup of big, bold tartar also attends and is everything the potent fish like this requires of it. Its a flavor combo to be reckoned with. Traditionally, coleslaw is the red-headed step child of the Fish Fry  often overlooked and rarely celebrated, its always there but usually no one cares. The slaw at Red Pines is a much more loveable brew. Its crisp, clean vinegar base has just the right balance - not too zingy, and not too wienie  making it highly gobbleable and worthy of your affection. Traditions have a way of fading over the years, but as far as Im concerned this one could last a lifetime. Red Pines is the perfect stopping point on my journey west and as long as the fish is there to keep luring me in, Ill keep taking the bait. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and think its one of the best the La Crosse area has to offer  Friday special or not.  redpinesbarandgrill.comW7305 County Road ZOnalaska, WI 54650     (608) 779-2800",2167,0.24292060212514757,0.5235123966942147

If, on the other hand, you are a logical individual who realizes that I have a life outside of Fish Fry and that Im not always in Madison on Friday night please continue on  youll be glad you did, especially if you ever find yourself in the La Crosse area on Friday.I heard about Red Pines Bar & Grill from a buddy of mine and had to wait quite a while before I was able to get up that way on a Friday. Of course, it happened to be the second Friday of lent and the place was SLAMMED. I was lucky to get a foot in the door more or less a spot at the bar, but eventually succeeded and got an order in. It was a small miracle. The only real special at the Pines on Friday is a haddock/shrimp combo and since I had no interest in the shrimp I went for the lake perch that resides on the regular menu. The food came fast considering how busy it was and everything looked superb. The fish amounted to seven meaty fillets each of which was coated in a brilliant breading. The fish itself was moist and tender which made it the perfect canvass for the superbly seasoned breading. It was delicious and truly outstanding. I chose the regular fries over the house-made chips and they turned out to be anything by ordinary. The skinny spuds were crunchy and delicious with a curly fry style seasoning on em. There were plenty of them to go around which means they outlasted the fish and then some. Saddling up next to the perch was a Solo cup of thick and creamy tartar that was just how youd like it to be. The rice wine vinegar based slaw was also what you want and probably some of the best Ive ever had. It was clearly house-made, super flavorful, and diverse. There were little green pepper chunks everywhere and while they could have overwhelmed the mixture their diminutive stature kept them on the mellow side. The only downfall to the perch plate was the fact that there was no bread served with it, whereas the Friday special haddock and shrimp comes with Texas toast. I would have absolutely loved a slice Fish Fry isnt just popular in Madison. Its a Wisconsin thing, and since you can stumble upon them anywhere in our great state I dont feel bad reviewing one thats not in the area from time to time. Overall, we highly recommend the lake perch at Red Pines, and certainly wont hesitate to stop again next time Im in the area. redpinesbarandgrill.comW7305 County Road ZOnalaska, WI 54650     (608) 779-2800",2571,0.21393601190476189,0.5000702075702076

Not only was the bar incredibly tiny, but it looked skeezy, and had a bad reputation. I skipped their Fish Fry for years until the place finally closed down in mid-2013. Not long after it reopened as Patricks Grill with a new owner and a new menu.Patricks claim to fame is BBQ, but when they recently won a local Fish Fry poll I sat up and took notice. A place this fresh, winning best Fish Fry in Madison? Balderdash! I said, and knew I needed to eat it to believe it. I waited a few weeks for any buzz to die down and finally paid them a visit on March, 21st. I didnt show up until 8pm only to find the place incredibly dead. I was a little surprised.Since it was quiet there were plenty of stools to choose from and I had an $11.75 3-piece in front of me about 10 minutes later (there is also a $10.00 2-piece on special). The Fish Fry comes in two baskets: one with the fish, fries, and tartar, and another with beans, corn bread and slaw  not exactly a balance of power but a thoughtful split nonetheless. As I so often do I started in with the fish, and liked what it had to offer. The flaky cod featured a very light, crumbly breading, that had a nice texture, but lacked seasoning and didnt hold the meat together. Thus, rather than dip the averaged-sized pieces as a whole I had to pull them apart in chunks and go at it that way. The fish itself was of good quality, but a couple parts were bordering on translucence although it didnt seem to affect taste. Overall, it was a good, solid, inoffensive cod, but even with three pieces the portion was on the small side. Some shoestring style fries shared the fishs basket and were kinda like McDonalds fries. They were golden and crispy, and came in good numbers although there were a few odd balls among the ranks. The last piece in basket #1s puzzle was a standard Solo cup of tartar. It was a thick and zesty mix, and its heart was in the right spot, but even it couldnt fully push the fish over the top. Basket #2 was full of sides, all of which allude to Patricks affinity for BBQ. I started with the creamy coleslaw which was a basic blend, didnt appear to be homemade, and was nothing unique. The cornbread came next and while it probably goes great with some brisket the petite cube missed the mark here as it was a little dry and flavorless. On the other hand, the baked beans were superb and easily the highlight of the meal. They had a marvelous smoky flavor and even some pieces of real brisket mixed in. While beans dont come standard with most Fish Frys I was certainly glad Patricks threw them in and I definitely would have eaten a bunch more of those babies. Theres no doubt in my mind that Patricks is a huge step up from its predecessor even though I never actually visited Becks back in the day. While I wouldnt say this Fish Fry is the best in the Madison area (Id put it in the same tier as places like Wilsons  a strong B/B+) it does have a lot going for it. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry, and definitely want to come back for the brisket and some more of those baked beans someday. www.facebook.com/pages/Patricks-Grill/5322040935278842515 Highway 51McFarland, WI 53558     (608) 838-7190",3302,0.17128898108064775,0.44565756774090115

In those days it was just the Dane County Coliseum and a big parking lot surrounded by marshland. There wasnt much going on out there besides that which gave the Coliseum Bar a stranglehold on thirsty hockey fans and parched concert goers alike. On our last visit lo those many years ago the food and atmosphere were atrocious which is why it took us so long to go back despite the fact we know they have a Friday Fish Fry that we needed to review. Since then much has changed at the isolated bar, mostly for the better. The interior has been totally remodeled, and the bar is actually quite inviting. It looks clean and modern, and much less dingy than it did back in the 90s. The CB runs their Fish Fry all day long on Friday, but doesnt give any cheaper options for lunch. All of their Friday specials go for $15 or more and come fully loaded so theres really no way to have a light lunch (unless maybe you want to get a sandwich or something like that, but thats no Fish Fry). Cod, haddock, and walleye and the main players, each of which comes with choice of potato, coleslaw, rye bread, soup or salad, and a cookie for dessert. There are three soups to choose from and the clam chowder we sampled was creamy and hearty, but boasted much more potato than clam. The fish arrived on the chowders heels ensuring that both would need to be eaten simultaneously. The cod is served in four thin pieces each of which has a light breading that looks flavorful, but lacks follow-through. This fish is supposedly soaked in beer before being breaded and fried, but it tasted more like it was soaked in whisky. The alcohol gave the cod a skunky flavor which was problematic since the fish wasnt of the highest quality to begin with. The tartar sauce didnt help matters either. While it was unique, it was probably too unique for its own good. It included a bunch of dill, bountiful capers, and some other stuff we didnt even attempt to discern. Rarely do we say that a tartar actually made the fish worse, but this one definitely did. Salvaging the sinking ship to some degree were a boatload of skin-on, julienne-cut fries with plenty of salt (probably too much salt for a lot of people). The spuds were well-fried and tasty, and offered a nice palate cleanser. Some homemade slaw came next and like the tartar was very diverse, but in the worst way. It was unappetizing to say the least and had a strange salty flavor. In addition, there were some hard twig-like pieces of cabbage that could barely be chewed and necessitated spitting out. Blech. The highlight of the meal was most certainly the whole slice of thick-cut rye although the cookie was pretty good too. The rye was soft and chewy and would have paired perfectly with a better slaw had it been available. Over time there have been a lot of improvements near the Coliseum including: the Exhibition Hall at the Alliant Energy Center, The Goodman Pool, and of course, the Coliseum Bar. While the revamped bar has nicely been brought into the modern age the Fish Fry could still use a little work. Overall, we dont recommend this Fish Fry and likely wont return for it any time soon. www.coliseumbarmadison.com/232 E Olin AvenueMadison, WI 53713     (608) 251-2434",3337,0.11867913832199546,0.48605442176870745

The fish I speak of is 1) cod or 2) walleye and since I was in splurge mode I went with the more expense freshwater fish. Now, there was a day in the Top's infancy when they were doing walleye in a way that no others were. While it was the same fillet you'll find today it had a breading that was 1) incredibly crispy, and 2) loaded with a peppery pop that none other had mastered. It was nothing less than exemplary, but unfortunately things have changed. Lucky the change wasn't a total loss as the new wave walleye at the tip top is still good just not what the old crunchy one was. The new incarnation is very Dexter's-like in both 1) taste, and 2) appearance. Thee current light breading has a simple seasoning but the highlight is the flavor of the fish. It's moist and flaky, so it's tough to complain about but, I definitely  yearn for Fry of yesterday. The Tip Top plays the Farm to Table card to some extent so I, and you, might expect a fancier French fry, but these babies are pretty basic. While they are 1) perfectly acceptable, and 2) adequately fried, they are just a shade better than the standard crinkles. They seemingly are made in-house and don't really take things to the next level.On the other hand the tartar takes things to 1) the next level, an two the level beyond that. This sauce is large and in charge and as homemade as they come. It's has almost too much pizzaz to handle and really jazzes up the sanzzy walleye. It's zz's to the max. The TTT has historically had a basic, purple cabbage, vinegar-bomb slaw, but a new blend has taken over. This mix is much more colorful and had what appeared to be apples in it. It was still overpowered by the vinegar, but I for one like it that way. The apples were lost to the acid, but if I could actually taste them it would have been way more off-putting. This mix was 1) new, and 2) more appealing to the masses. Verdict - win. The Tip Top has 1) never served bread with their fish, and 2) probably never will. We've come to grips with that and just have to let it be what it is. It's a good thing everything else is so good or this omission might really make us sad. This birthday lunch was a good one 1) because the food was good, and 2) (and even more importantly) because I was joined by my lovely wife and little boy. It was a great time at the Tip Top and one I will never forget. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and think you could do a while lot worse than the Tip Top on a Friday even if they have devolved a bit. www.thetiptoptavern.com/601 North StreetMadison, WI 53704     (608) 241-5515",2722,0.2550507783462329,0.45877115308933486

A Fish Fry on a patio is an even better thing. And a Fish Fry on a patio near a lake is pretty much the best thing ever. Unfortunately, there arent a lot of lakeside dining establishments in Madison despite the number of lakes, so the Tip Top doesnt stand much of a chance in that regard. What they do have is a nice big patio and an amazing Fish Fry, and, as we all know, two outta three aint bad.TT has walleye for $16 and cod for $14 on Friday both of which can be ordered deep fried or baked. They also have a new section of indoor seating which appears to have nearly doubled the functional space... The Tip Top is evolving! Despite the updated interior, and as you probably guessed from the intro, we chose to sit on the patio on this sunny September day and had an attentive waitress at our side in no time. Not only was she punctual, but was extremely gracious when she misheard our order and brought my wife fried cod instead of baked. She replaced it without incident which garnered her a princely tip and a note here on MFF.com. As per usual the walleye was good, but like the establishment itself, the breading has changed. No longer does the freshwater fish boast the dark brown, pepper-loaded crunchy deliciousness we loved so dearly. Its now more of a standard beige tone with flecks of seasoning throughout. Its more Dexters-style now, which is less unique and makes it slightly less intriguing in our opinion. While I preferred the old this was still plenty good in its own right and of course, the fillet was gigantic. A handful of fries appeared to be cut in-house as they came in all sorts of odd shapes and sizes. Most importantly, they were perfectly fried and played a respectable Robin to the walleyes Batman. The tartar was as smooth as silk and its zesty flavor paired perfectly with the flaky fish. The Tip Top is a bread-free zone so none came with the fish, but as per usual, but the pungent slaw made up for it. Its a simple red cabbage and vinegar mix that looks plain, but is soaked just long enough that some crunch persists without tasting raw. As times change evolution is inevitable, and were glad to see the Tip Top doing well and expanding. We have loved their Fish Fry from day one and while we would like to have the old breading back we can continue to get behind the new stuff. Its still great, and something well have no problem getting used to. Overall, we still highly recommend this Fish Fry and only wish they had a lakeside lot in their future.

Ever since I first laid eyes on the tiny taverns walleye I knew this Fish Fry was one for the record books. This is easily some of the tastiest fish around and is getting harder and harder for me to pass up come Friday.This round of walleye was classic Tip Top. For starters, it crazy that a Fish Fry can even be considered classic after only being around for a couple years, but this baby definitely is. Its a testament to the Tip Top staff and shows just how established theyve become in such a short time. Its delicious, its consistent, its consistently deliciouswhich is exactly what makes it classic. This fillet is simply gorgeous. Its thick and meaty with their crispy breading that holds it all together, but gives way effortlessly when provoked. When the crispy and crunchy breading meets the smooth and flaky fish a euphoric sensation washes over you, and even with a rambunctious toddler bouncing off the walls all was blissful in our fishy little world. This is easily some of the best walleye currently out there, no bones about it (and thats not even a pun although there were no bones in this fillet so I guess it actually could beits not though, I swear). The Tip Top fries arent cut in-house (as far as I can tell) and arent the best (based on my experience), but are also far from the worst. At the very least they are expertly fried and lovingly prepared which is more than a lot of places can say. Walleye this good could easily stand on its own two fins, but the Tip Top trots out some spectacular tartar sauce just to make things totally irresistible. This superb sauce has plenty of diversity and, while thin, adheres to the fish like glue. The walleye obviously doesnt need a push, but this loving caress takes it everything to a whole other level. A vinegar-kissed, purple cabbage coleslaw does all it can, but is a little raw (both literally and figuratively). Its super crispy and clean, but almost too much so. The shredded carrots laid on top lend some diversity to the aesthetic but do little for the flavor. While its not at all bad its just so basic that some (including myself) might not appreciate its subtlety. No Fish Fry is perfect and although this one is damn close, even it has a failing. The Tip Top still hasnt realized that bread strikes a balance to all their fried goodness and doesnt put any sort or starch on the plate. Even a small slice of rye would go a long way, but as of yet it remains absent. Heres to hoping they come around someday The more times I have fish at the Tip Top the more I think that its some of the best Madison has to offer. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and feel 100% confident that anyone who tries it would agree.

Its not much to look at. Its not in the swankiest of neighborhoods. Its not even the kind of place youd think is a dining establishment if you were just driving by and didnt know any better. Its a little bit of a hidden gem although probably not for long.The Tip Top has shed is once sordid reputation thanks to new ownership and a new philosophy  a philosophy that jives with Madisons burgeoning foodie scene. The Tip Top has a handle on suiting the discerning diners of Madison and their Fish Fry is no exception. On Fridays they have fish from open to close  the cod going for $13 and the walleye for $16. This round was walleye for us and it was the tops. We were early, probably the first or second fish order of the night, and the chunky fillet came out smoldering hot. Of course, being the glutton for punishment I am, I dove right in and torched the roof of my mouth in the process. It was a boneheaded move, but even the level of stupidity couldnt ruin this Fish Fry. The big flaky planes of walleye at the TTT are home to a crispy, crunchy, breading that typically has a peppery overtone that is hard to miss. Perhaps it was my scorched palate, or maybe the pepper boy wasnt in yet, but this fillet was more subtle, more demure. The grinder gave way to a more balanced blend of spices that was still crumbly and delectable, and complemented the exemplary fish just right. A bevy of thick Julienne-cut fries played Robin to the walleyes Batman and were fried to perfection. While not cut in-house from the looks of it, these boys made you wonder if freezer fries can be done any better. Theyre certainly no jokers. No great fish is complete without an equally saucy tartar and the Tip Tops tartar takes the cake. This stuff is tartarerrific and clearly made in-house. It packs a huge bang for the buck and even quells a burned roof of the mouth as well as any tartar can. Pulling up the rear was some of the taverns homemade coleslaw which is a vinegar bomb and straight to the point. It is crisp and clean, but in actuality looks much better than it tastes. There is also no bread served at the Tip Top which is a bummer but not a deal breaker. They say good things come in small packages and that sentiment is exemplified at the Tip Top. The place is small, but the food delivers in a big way and they really get the most out of every square inch, Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and think its currently one of the finest our fine city has to offer which is no small feat. www.thetiptoptavern.com/601 North StreetMadison, WI 53704     (608) 241-5515",2685,0.12887987012987015,0.46343113676446995

The Tip Top Tavern, it turns out, is a world-class sprinter. Away we go!It started with the walleye (which was already arguably the best in the city) but a newly added beer battered cod has shifted things into a whole nother gear. The walleye isnt cheap (17 beans) but is well worth every single one of those legumes. Its superbly moist, incredibly flaky, and a delight to eat. On each of our three encounters it has been perfectly fried and decked out with a light, flaky, appropriately-seasoned breading which complements the supple fish just right. Its really amazing and literally some of the best we can remember eating anywhere. The walleye sounds like fifth gear but there is still more to come in the form of the newly added cod. While it might be more of a lateral shift, for arguments sake well just say this is a six-speed. The cuts of cod vary vastly in size, but the 3-piece adds up to 6-8 ounces or so in our estimation. The fish is home to a rich, dark beer batter that bordered on Owls Nest-like excellence (I kid you not). The fish itself is pure and flaky and not the least bit greasy. It is all-around impressive. While there is a choice between fries and mixed-greens it is basically irrelevant in our book. Im sure the greens are fine, and assuredly much healthier, but the standard Julienne-cut rendition fries are always going to win. They are more than plentiful, thoughtfully-seasoned, and flat-out well-executed. Reinforcing both walleye and cod alike is the Tip Tops thick and decadent tartar which is truly tip-top. Its tangy and rich with a little something savory on the backend thats hard to put your finger on. The house-made slaw is a vinegar-based, purple cabbage variety with some subtle carrot shreds to keep things interesting. While palatable, its not necessarily alluring, but it offers nice change of pace if nothing else. While every element of this Fish Fry hits the mark there is one obvious detractor  no bread. Bummer. I almost hate to give this place such a glowing review because it is tiny, I repeat TINY, and they are already pretty busy on Friday nights meaning this might be the last trip for our small family (babies and hour long waits in a cramped bar simply dont mix).

Of course, there are the old standbys like the Esquire and the Avenue but recently a new crop of establishments have marked their territory and are making a lasting impression on the city. Places like Dexters Pub, the Villa Tap, Stalzys Deli, and Alchemy have all found their niche, and in some cases usurped patronage from the venerable supper clubs. Its a vibrant scene to be sure, and a new player is adding yet another dimension to the diverse mix.The new guy in this instance is the Tip Top Tavern on the corner of North and Commercial. While the Tip Top has been around forever it recently reopened with a new focus, and a new Fish Fry to match. The fish of choice is walleye and it comes in at $17.00 which is in the mid-range price-wise. The Tip Top is tiny, but turnover is high so if all the tables are full just get a stool at the bar and wait for a minute or two (or better yet, just eat up there). Despite the small footprint the kitchen takes their time in preparing the fish which amounted to a good 20-25 minutes on both of our visits. Despite the wait the grub comes out as hot as can be and pretty as a picture. The walleye fillet is a large one and every bit of the quoted 8 ounces (if not more). Its chockfull of delectable, flaky meat and paired with a crumbly breading that has an extremely satisfying crunch and satisfactory amount of seasoning. Its a harmonious pairing and textural balance that needs to be eaten to be appreciated. Lots of thick-cut, julienne potatoes join the party and are pretty basic, but a definite step up from skinny crinkles. A house-made tartar also does the dance with a noticeable pop that complements the walleye wonderfully. The remaining member of the quartet is a vinegar-based coleslaw that really tickles the taste buds. Its a red cabbage variety which gives it a pinkish hue thats quite intriguing. Whats not so pretty is the lack of bread which leaves a bit of a sour taste in our mouths especially since kind of expect a lot for $17.00. The east side is the side of town as far as Fish Fry is concerned and the Tip Top is just helping to bolster that reputation. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and will line it up any time we want to sink out teeth into a nice hunk of walleye. www.thetiptoptavern.com/601 North StreetMadison, WI 53704     (608) 241-5515",2395,0.23369933097205822,0.5233754755345663

The North Street bar was an intimidating looking spot associated more with a beer swilling crowd than alluring grub. It was one of those places you just kind of stayed away from, but oh, the times they are a-changing. After recent renovations they diminutive dive has been born anew with a sleek atmosphere and an emphasis on high quality chow. We heard the Fish Fry was one to be reckoned with and made the trip the first chance we got.The Tip Tops menu is concise, but features intriguing options including several veggie-friendly ones. On Fridays, and only on Fridays, an 8 oz. walleye Fish Fry is listed on the chalkboard for $15.00 and serves as the daily special. The Tip Top kitchen hums and plates their fish in a flash. The walleye comes steaming hot with a breading that is light to the touch but dark brown in color. The crumbly coating is crispy, with a slight hint of seasoning. It plays off the thick fillet nicely in a way that lets the moist meat take center stage. However, there were at least a half dozen bones to deal with (which is never ideal), but they werent enough to ruin the fish or anything like that. Under the substantial fish fillet sat a pile of thick, julienne-cut fries. They were the skin-on style and possibly cut in-house, but thats doubtful. In any event, they were very good and had some pre-applied seasoning, although a few were under-fried. For those dunkers in the crowd some homemade tartar joins the fun and brings a lot of flavor to the table. Its a very diverse mix with a deceptively thick consistency  its clearly not your typical mayo/relish mix. It has some serious pep (possibly supplied by cayenne pepper) and a discernable amount of lime juice. It brought the heat and really gave the walleye a welcomed kick in the pants. No bread comes with the fish at the Tip Top so the last item on the plate was some homemade slaw. It was a rice wine vinegar variety, with lots of red peppers, and other colorful entities. It had plenty of zest and tasted pretty darn good, but of course, anything with rice wine vinegar does. For those who avoided the Tip Top in its previous life (like we did) the time has come to put your fears aside and pay them a visit. While the place is tiny, the food looms large and characterizes a remarkable transformation. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and will be back to see if they can improve on their first performance. There is certainly enough room for them to take things over the top. www.thetiptoptavern.com/601 North StreetMadison, WI 53704     (608) 241-5515",2692,0.12332936507936507,0.4653333333333333

They usually range from $8 to $12 with anything cheaper being a real deal and anything more expensive being questionable. Recently the price of fish (especially freshwater varieties) has shot up and places are charging more and more for their Friday specials. Its not uncommon to pay upwards of $15 for a plate of lake perch or $13 for cod, but usually these high price tags have more to offer than just the fish...the new(ish) Brocach on Monroe Street definitely does.Brocach is pushing the limits with their Friday offering at $16, but they certainly do what they can to justify the cost. Before the fish comes, and big rectangular starter dish with some pickles, coleslaw, pumpernickel-rye bread, and tartar shows up (although there is nothing to actually dip in the tartar unless youre into dipping pickles which would be weird). The rye is flat-out phenomenal and absurdly plentiful. The Badger Den trots out three huge half slices that are soft and fresh with the perfect amount of rye stank. They pair divinely with the smooth and creamy homemade buttermilk coleslaw and really start this Fry off right. Before you can get all that eaten the fish will almost assuredly show up. Like the starters, the fish is abundant and lovingly prepared. Four grand pieces of haddock weigh in around 10 ounces and feature a thick beer batter that only adds to their might. Despite the thick batter they are well-fried and only minimally greasy thanks to the high quality fish. While the batter is too thick for our tastes it is tolerable when paired with the flaky fish although it could use some flavor of its own. In the end the smooth taste of the haddock comes through which is good enough for us. Some shoestring-style fries come with the cod, but this round was under-fried and limp. The potion was fair, but their mushiness made me wish Id chosen the sweet potato fries or one of the other many side options. More of the homemade tartar came with the fish and got devoured despite its thin consistency. While wed like to see a thicker sauce that could stand up to the brawny haddock, the Brocach blend has a zesty taste that still picks it up to some degree. This aint yo mamas tartar and we wouldnt even want to begin to try and decipher all that goes into the homemade mixture. Since there was so much fish we actually wound up using the cup that came on the starter plate as well, so that whole thing turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Still, its strange it was there initially. The Brocach location on the Square has been an institution in Madison for a long time so its no surprise that their new location on Monroe is thriving as well. As far as Irish Restaurant & Bars go it is way up there and no doubt one of the best youll find in the state. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry even at the lofty price tag. The food is high quality, the atmosphere is clean and inviting, and Brocachs reputation speaks for itself. www.brocach.com/mmonroe/home.html1843 Monroe StreetMadison, WI 53711     (608) 819-8653",3084,0.14456611570247935,0.5393690148235603

As Americans we expect to get our monies worth when we eat out and if for some reason we dont we more than likely wont be returning to the establishment that burned us. Its just a fact of the matter and something we all deal with. As Wisconsinites we tend to be even more frugal with our cash, and if we feel like weve be overcharged for a Fish Fry you can bet there is no way well be back for it again. If, on the other hand, we feel like we got a great deal, that place immediately becomes one of our favorite spots and somewhere we end up at often. Hacks Sports Page in Oregon falls into the latter category.Hacks does fish for lunch and dinner with cod, lake perch, and shrimp available for both and grilled walleye added on after 4:30. The prices take a $2 jump during dinnertime, but even at $10-$12 are still a good deal. During the lunch hour the fish emerges from the kitchen quickly and looks superb. The $9 lake perch plate boasts 10 hearty fillets in a light, crispy breading. While the coating could use more seasoning, there is just enough so as not to mask the lovely lake perch flavor. Each morel is moist and flaky and definitely the genuine article (not pike-perch or some other non-yellow species). And maybe most importantly, 10 fillets for nine bucks is an amazing deal  thats less than $1 per not including all the sides and such. Speaking of sides, Hacks definitely does them justice. There are several spuds to choose from and we selected the beer battered fries over the regular fries, the house-cut chips, or the baby reds. The BBFs had a nice crunch, but an almost smoky aftertaste (perhaps due to some old fryer oil?). Regardless, they were still good, and most importantly, abundant. The tartar was a little heavy on the relish and really didnt do the fish any favors. It tasted suspiciously Sysco-y and while it had the desirable thick consistency the flavor was simply not pleasing. The basic dinner roll also left a bit of an odd taste in our mouths, although more figuratively than literally this time. It was a little crusty and just didnt taste fresh. When you hear the term coleslaw you think of the kind served at Hacks. It is thick and creamy, with a zesty flavor and minimal diversity. Its surely not bad, but also isnt going to win an award any time soon. Value plays a major component in our daily lives and Friday Fish Fry is no exception. While some places seem to do all they can to make every last buck, there are others that go the exact opposite route and you wonder how they can even make a profit at what theyre charging. Hacks is somehow able to swing 10 perch complete with sides for $9 whereas a lot of places give you 5-6 fillets for $12 or more. While were not sure exactly how theyre doing it, were certainly glad that they are. Overall, we recommend this Fish fry and will take the drive to Oregon any time we want a lot of fish for a little dough. www.facebook.com/pages/Hacks-Sports-Page/104429539589771?rf=203317083030765126 Braun RoadOregon, WI 53575     (608) 835-8611",3110,0.21080729166666665,0.4684576274420025

The Hound gained instant acclaim for their Friday specials (specifically their cod) and have since spawned another restaurant called the Waypoint Public House in Monona. The Waypoint has its own Friday offerings which are akin to, but uniquely different from its Fitchburgian brother. I visited both places on the same Friday in order to draw a comparison between the two. You might be surprised at what I found. The first stop was lunch at the Flying Hound which consisted of lake perch and French fries. The perch costs a reasonable $13.50 and comes with everything it should except bread. Ive had perch at the Hound three times now and this was best of the lot although it was still exceedingly salty (and this coming from a guy who loves his salt). The fish was pliable and flaky, but all of the subtle fishy goodness was lost to the hyper-seasoned breading. It was simply overbearing and needed heaps of tartar to mellow it out, and even that couldnt quite do it. Tons of skin-on matchstick fries are piled next to and beneath the perch, and fried right to the sweet spot. They were golden sticks of deliciousness, but like the fish, salted more heavily than most people could handle. A unique house-made tartar accompanies the fish and has a good flavor. While mayo-based, it has much more in there than just relish. As an aside: there is a kids fish and chips available as well. Its one piece of cod, served with fries, and ranch dressing instead of tartar. Weird I know, but that must be what kids are in to. The Hound has some very interesting slaw which is clearly made in-house, but kind of runny. Much like the other items is also has a very unique seasoning applied. I couldnt say exactly what it was (coriander or something out of the ordinary), but it really overpowered the blend making for a very unbalanced dish. While I really appreciate all the effort the Flying Hound goes through to make their Fish Fry unique the heavy-handed seasoning gets to be a bit much. What we found at the Waypoint draws a stark contrast. Ive had the cod at the Waypoint in the past and thought it paled in comparison to that of that of the Flying Hound. This time I decided to try their $14.00 walleye and found it to be markedly better. For starters, the Waypoint (and the Hound for that matter) are both exceedingly accommodating to families with young children. They seat smartly to ensure families have the space they need without taking anything away from the experience of other diners. The food also comes quickly at both places which is a godsend when youre sitting there with a hungry child. If you have a kid you know what Im talking about. The Waypoint walleye fillet was on the small side, and covered in a dark and crispy coating that melded well with the flaky fish. Since it was clearly a young fish it didnt have any musty flavors or anything which allowed the breading to take center stage (which it did thanks more to its texture rather than its taste). Since it was small, it went fast but was still better overall than the salty perch I had for lunch. Both Point and Hound appear to serve the same fries although they more conservatively portioned at the dinner destination. The Waypoint tartar was noticeably different however, with more zip and much smoother consistency than its comrade. The Waypoint mimicked its sibling in that there was no bread provided, but stood apart from it with a peppy, much more balanced slaw. While the Flying Hound made my write-up in the Isthmus those many months ago, the Waypoint might actually have the better Fish Fry at this point. The perch at the Hound was again too salty, but I will say that of all the fish Ive had between the two places their cod is still the best. The Waypoint is doing a better job of striking a balance, and while the Hound has the highest highs, it also reaches the lowest lows. Overall, we still recommend the lake perch and the Flying Hound, but recommend the walleye and the Waypoint Public House more. Both are good, but staying on the beam is critical and Public House strikes the right balance. www.flyinghoundpub.com/6317 McKee RoadFitchburg, WI 53719     (608) 310-4422",4335,0.21505945353347944,0.4390819137572384

Their claim to fame is their cod and its really something special. The 3-piece goes for $11.00 and is best when preceded by a cup of the Hounds signature clam chowder.Clam chowder is the Soup of the Day on Fridays and easily some of the best our fair city has to offer. Its rich and flavorful with big chunks of clam throughout. There is enough clam that almost every bite has a bit which is a rarity as far as chowder goes. The kitchen at the Hound flies and the food always comes quickly, almost too quickly. Three lightly-breaded and flaky pieces of pristine cod take center stage on the plate making their presence known immediately. The fish has a delicate texture which pairs miraculously well with its well-seasoned and crumbly breading. Its effortless eating and makes you want far more than the three pieces provided. House-cut fries are the side of choice with the fish, and as you might expect they lack uniformity but have that certain something that makes them genuine. While not always perfect, they are usually well-fried although when you have small bits along with full-sizers its inevitable there will be a few that are overdonethats just the tradeoff you have to deal with. The velvety smooth cod is good enough to be eaten solo, but of course its always nice to have some tartar to dip it in. While a beefier sauce could easily overwhelm it, the Flying Hounds mix is thin and tasty, and complements it well with a mild dilly undertone. It does just enough. No bread comes with the Fish Fry but that little oversight cant ground this Hound. Plenty of thinly-sliced coleslaw picks up some of the slack with its careful, well-balanced preparation. While this isnt the perfect Fish Fry, the Flying Hound is doing a lot of things right with it (especially the fish itself). Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and count it among the best of the newcomers in the Madison area. www.flyinghoundpub.com/6317 McKee RoadFitchburg, WI 53719     (608) 310-4422",2111,0.25748838559814174,0.5797793263646922

Even the best restaurants can have an off-day (or even just an off-plate for that matter) and if given another chance will reward you for your loyalty. Some places have earned this opportunity at redemption and we were hoping this was the case with the Flying Hound. For starters, our first visit to the Flying Hound was nothing less than exemplary, and we figured they would become a mainstay in our Fish Fry arsenal. This initial encounter featured a couple impressive pieces of cod which had us seeing stars. After a second visit, and a second fish selection, the glitter faded somewhat under the weight of a few tough pieces of perch. Based on the first run-in we believed theyd earned the shot at redemption and figured theyd bounce back in a big way. You could call today the rubber match. We started our third get-together differently than either of the others  with a cup of the Hounds homemade clam chowder. The thick and spicy soup was superb and featured at least five to six nice-sized chunks of clam. While we usually abstain from the chowder we were happy we went all-out this time as it was easily some of the best weve ever had. Really...Ever. We were early, as we so often are nowadays, so the fish came in the blink of an eye. Salt is the name of the game with the breading at the FH  which made it a bit overwhelming. Its pungent and crispy and basically makes the thin fish disappear beneath its sodium sheath. Its a shame because the perch is clearly high quality and while we love a well-seasoned breading we still need to taste the fish to some extent. Plenty of fries accompanied the briny perch and were fried just right. While we werent sure if they were house-cut after our last visit we concluded they must be after a third helping. They show plenty of skin (which is always a good thing) and there were a bunch of little nubs which you have to assume food distributors (like Sysco) would weed out. Verdict: house-cut all the way.Helping to make the perch more palatable was the Hounds homespun tartar sauce. It was nothing less than excellent and although nondescript, mellowed the salty fish out. Whereas the slaw tasted funky on both of our previous visits this time around it just tasted fresh and clean. It was an angel hair slaw and still lacked pop, but did what it needed to do. No bread came with the $14 perch plate so there was nothing it could do.  The Flying Hound is still making their way and clearly working out some kinks. While we loved the cod (and if we were to come back wed be sure to get it again), the perch needs a little work. Overall, even with an overly-salty breading, we still barely recommend this Fish Fry due largely to the supporting cast. If and when the Hound starts firing on all cylinders all the time they will be a serious force to be reckoned with. www.flyinghoundpub.com/6317 McKee RoadFitchburg, WI 53719     (608) 310-4422",2959,0.1777555555555555,0.43064126984126977

The fish was phenomenal, the service shined, and the atmosphere was awesome. I just knew we needed to come back as soon as possible and try some of their other fish offerings and today was the day.This time around we came for lunch and tried the lake perch rather than the cod. Whereas the cod dinner of two weeks prior was spectacular the lake perch lunch was lackluster. We were surprised to say the least, but as they say, thats why we leave no stone unturned. Unlike dinner, the crowd at the FH was sparse during the daytime which detracted from the ambiance somewhat. The service was still fast while sitting at the bar, but not quite as engrossing. Regardless, the fish came very quickly and thats whats really important. The lake perch at the Hound carries a hefty $14 price tag which gets you five fillets, a side of fries or a salad, a cup of tartar, and a bowl of homemade coleslaw. The perch carried an ultra-crispy breading that tasted a bit over-fried. It was dark and very firm to the point where the edges on two or three of the fillets needed to be ripped apart or gnawed through. The breading had a lot of flavor (which we normally drool over) but it was actually a bit too much for the fragile fish. That said, the perch seemed to be of high quality and we would give it a second shot hoping for a less heavy-handed fry cook. A forest of fries occupied the periphery of the plate in a dense undergrowth that took some serious lumberjacking to get through. The amount of fries was totally insane when compared to the portion of fish and we had to spend a few minutes thinning their numbers after the fish was clear cut. The tubers were well-fried and tasty but after having them a couple times I dont think they are cut in-house, and at the very least not freshly cut. On both visits the tartar was tremendous although its on the thin side as far as tartars go. It was actually more necessary on the second turn as it covered some of the imperchfections in the fish with its pop and clingabilty (I know, I made up a couple words there). Besides the unimpressive perch the biggest detractors in this Fish fry were the coleslaw and the lack of bread. No bread is a bummer but that was expected since there wasnt any the first time around either. Similarly, we also expected the slaw to be so-so and it certainly lived up (or down) to that expectation. While the portion seemed even larger than our previous encounter with it that wasnt necessarily a good thing since it was still dry and used an odd flavored vinegar. Im not entirely sure if it was the vinegar or the cabbage used but in all honesty it almost tasted dirty. So it goes. No Fish Fry is immune to an off day but the best of the best have ways of minimizing the damage. At this point the Flying Hound is one for two, with one amazing meal and one that was iffy at best. Overall, we barely recommend the lake perch based on this visit, but will be back for a rubber match to see what the real Flying Hound Fish Fry is. Im still banking on the greatness of our first rendezvous. www.flyinghoundpub.com/6317 McKee RoadFitchburg, WI 53719     (608) 310-4422",3293,0.10389989483209826,0.48771895712573676

Fish Fry fans in the Madison area have been lucky enough to have these experiences time and again with places like: Dexters Pub, Crawfish Junction, and Buck & Honeys. These restaurants burst onto the scene and instantly secured their position among the areas best by offering a commitment to quality and a willingness to improve. Rarely do you find a place that can do what these places have done, but the new Flying Hound Alehouse in Fitchburg has made their own claim to fame in just a few short months. You know the Flying Hound takes their Friday Fish Fry seriously before you even walk in the door. Their website has a whole page dedicated to nothing but their Friday specials which does a nice job of expounding the virtues of their wild-caught fish as well as getting you in the mood to chow down. Like most places that are serious about Fish Fry they have cod, lake perch, and walleye available and in order to gauge their worth we started with the standard cod since thats what most people prefer. The cod comes in at $11.00 which isnt cheap, but is reasonable considering portion size and the type of establishment. For starters, the wait staff are on top of things, and we received friendly, punctual service from the moment we arrived until the second we left. Of course, this means the fish came out steaming hot and looking pretty. The 3-piece Wild-Caught Alaskan cod was truly top-notch, and incredibly impressive. It was pure and flaky with a light breading that was nothing short of delicious. The coating had a unique blend of seasoning and was fried so perfectly that no grease developed even upon sitting. It was really remarkable stuff. Some thick, Julienne-cut fries with skin-on come on the side and featured crispy exteriors and supple interiors. They seemed to be cut in-house, and while tossed greens were also an option we felt good about our deep-fried decision. The Hounds house-made tartar wasnt a traditional mix by any means. It wasnt thick, it wasnt loaded with relish, but it still clung like the dickens and had a great taste that put a superb finishing touch on the smooth cod. Like the fish it was exceptional, and while untraditional it was also undefinably delicious. Whereas the fish, fries, and tartar drove the bus, the slaw was just along for the ride. Like the tartar it was also untraditional, but crisp and fresh, and clearly made in-house. The uplifting mix had a lot of potential but lacked the zip to really take it home. This Fish Fry is easy to rave about, but for all the thoughtfulness that went into its creation there was one glaring omission: bread. A little slice of rye would certainly have gone a long way. While we adore old school supper clubs and admire neighborhood taverns that have stood for decades, were encouraged when new places throw their hat in the ring and give it their all. Overall, we highly recommend the cod at The Flying Hound and foresee great things as they continue to hone their craft. This place is definitely taking off and their Fish Fry is ready to soar. www.flyinghoundpub.com/6317 McKee RoadFitchburg, WI 53719     (608) 310-4422",3244,0.2925198976370852,0.5754784451659452

So many places have been doing fish for so long that ground rules have been established and expectations exist. That said, theres always room for unique interpretations on the standard so long as they are actual improvements. The new Bassett Street Brunch Club has their own take on the Wisconsin tradition and we recently paid them a visit to see what it was all about.The BSBC is a Food Fight restaurant which means a number of different things. We wont get into it too deeply here, but in a nutshell they offer good food, in a clean environment, although their Fish Frys usually fail to impress. We arrived at 5:30 this Friday and the place was relatively empty. Since there were only a handful of patrons at half past five the service was attentive and the food came very quickly. It all looked pretty as a picture although it was more of a 3 ½ x 5 than an 8 x 10. The 2-piece cod is served for lunch and dinner and the same tiny portion comes at both. The fish was delicious, featuring a flaky texture and a delightfully airy beer batter. It was so good that it wound up being a huge problem since we wanted much more than the exceedingly small allotment. We would surly have given it an Excellent score had the portion been a little more princely, but as it stands that just wouldnt be right. Matching with the conservative amount of cod was a wee portion of wedge fries. It was easily the smallest on record as there were literally six of them. S-I-X. Whats more, there was nothing really special about them which made the small portion seems all the more minuscule. It was a bit of a slap in the face (or a kick in groin depending on who you are) and doesnt even warrant a point per fry. The tartar at the BSBC is homemade, that you can be sure of, but homemade doesnt always translate to greatness. It was diverse mix, but the predominant flavor was lime juice, and there was a lot of it at that. It overpowered the sauce and was just way off base. To use the parlance of our times, wtf BSBC? Whereas the portion size and tartar composition missed the mark, the dense roll was a bullseye all the way. It had a subtle sweetness that was very enticing, although some rye would have been even better (and we know they have it since two grilled slabs came with the wifes salad).The slaw was homemade and fresh and while others might think it boring, we thought it was slightly above average. Weve found that Food Fight places tend to miss the mark with their Fish Frys and this is just more evidence to support those findings. Its really too bad because the fish was delicious, but the conservative portion really painted everything in a bad light. Overall, we dont recommend this Fish Fry, but think it shows a lot of potential. Another piece of fish (or two), a few extra wedges, and a little less lime juice in the tartar would get the BSBC heading in the right direction.www.brunchclubmadison.com444 W Johnson StreetMadison, WI 53703     (608) 467-5051",3029,0.1287355118000279,0.5396982497788949

Maybe Cheech and Chong? Or perhaps Rock and Roll? Then of course theres brats and beerthose are all amazing combos, and while they are legendary in their own right they all fall a bit short in my opinion. The only thing that comes close to the magisterial mix in is the meal that contains them and enjoying said meal with good people. I speak of course of enjoying a Fish Fry with friends, and our troop got our fill of just that at the Watertower Chop House in Sun Prairie.    It was Big Norbs Big 3-0 and Adam, his wife Jess, Nick, and myself all rendezvoused at the peak of the frying hour. We had a decent wait in the spacious bar before being summoned to the starboard side of the supper club, a theme that would percolate throughout the evening. Menus awaited our arrival and I was slightly taken aback, although not shocked to see the price hike since last we visited The ½ lb of lake perch now sits at an even 20 bones with an AYCE available for $28. There were also a whole bunch of other options including walleye and the omnipresent fried cod. All come with a bevy of sides to choose from and I went for the soup and salad bar and the French fries (for some reason  I should have stuck with the homemade potato pancakes). Watertowers salad bar is a big as they come in 2016, and features pretty much everything under the sun (except for pickled herring  the old man would be pissed). If you dont enjoy this salad bar thats 100% on you as its tough to screw up with this much variety. I dont even want to try and list everything they have, but if you can think of it its probably there. Our romp through was towards the end of the evening and while he chowder was pretty low and the scrapings at the bottom didnt have much in the way of clam it was still aces. The rolls were also available on the salad bar and these guys were plush and sweet. They tasted very fresh and were a solid step up from a basic yeast roll. I made it through my full salad before the fish arrived and was slightly surprised when they did. The lake perch were large, and seemingly too large to be true yellow perch as claimed. I guess maybe they could have been farm-raised monsters or something, but usually yellow perch are 3-4 inches and served in butterfly form. These goliaths were at least 6-7 inches long and had a really mild flavor. Like I say, maybe they were just farm raised or some world record breakers, but more than likely they were European perch or pike-perch. Regardless of their species, the crunchy panko breading offset the smooth texture in the right way although the fact they were so meaty made any seasoning fade into obscurity. Its not that the fries were bad, they werent, but they were still a mistake on my part. They are your basic supper club style fat julienne cuts, which are fine, but certainly cant hold a candle to homemade potato pancakes. Ugh. My bad. A thick and creamy tartar came along for the ride and made the fish something more. In reality, the portion was small for the large amount of fish, and while I probably should have gotten a second cup I managed to scrape by with one. I cant say if it was just April Fools or what, but the joke was definitely on me. The perch certainly through us for a loop and while I cant say for certain that it wasnt the genuine article my Spidey Senses were tingling. Regardless, everything was tasty although a couple standard deviations above the mean price-wise.

Most of the chatter is related to shoddy service and the like which, in my opinion, is a really hit or miss thing. It also seems that most of the negativity stems from some personal conflicts so it really is necessary to take a see it for yourself attitude. To that effect, Ive been there three times and while the service has been a little spotty, its nothing that overshadows the outstanding grub.My first two visits were for lunch and the only fish on the menu then is cod. The cod is a quality rendition, although the portion shrank dramatically from our first to second visit. During dinner the menu opens up and lake perch and walleye join the school. While both are expensive ($18) they come with a trip through the Chop Houses impressive salad bar which is worth a good $4-$5 on its own. This bar is one of, if not the best, salad bars the area currently has to offer. It comes fully stocked with fresh greens, all the usual accoutrements and some additional items you dont always find like chocolate mousse. The soup of the day is located at the end of the line and as youd expect it was clam chowder today. The bread should also have been up there but the last bun got taken right before I got to it and it was never refilled before we left. I piled the salad high and filled the bowl of chowder to the brim. I enjoyed every last bite of the fresh greens and every last slurp of the savory soup. It was a great start to the meal, and before you could say yum the perch was presented. Three fat butterflies adorned the plate and were clearly the real deal. They were surprisingly meaty with had a near perfect flavor. They were home to a crispy breading with plenty of seasoning. Its crumbly texture was pleasing to the eye, crunchy on the gums, and simply superb all around. There are numerous potato options at the Chop but when potato pancakes are on the list my decision is essentially made for me and these are some great cakes. They are medium-thick and supple with plenty of seasoning to keep your interest. Equally thick from edge to edge the delectable discs are kicked into high gear by a generous helping of apple sauce. Topping things off (quite literally) was the Watertowers homemade tartar. This stuff is the supper club standard thick and creamy variety with an extreme clingability (I know, I made that word up but its true). It was rich and zesty and iced this cake to perfection. When Herremans closed the Fish Fry fire went out of Sun Prairie. It successors, Babas and Harrys, were never able to rekindle that flame so its nice to see that the Watertower Chop House is packing them in and reestablishing that reputation. Overall, we highly recommend the lake perch and were hoping they keep that fire stoked for years to come www.watertowerchophouse.com109 W Main StreetSun Prairie, WI 53590     (608) 318-1857",2974,0.22120149911816575,0.5007231040564373

Whether its a brand new restaurant in a brand new building or just an old favorite that closed and reopened under new ownership, renewed vigor for our classic restaurants is evidenced across the state. It certainly is a great time to be a Badger. Although its called the Watertower Chophouse the venerable Sun Prairie establishment could just as well be called the Watertower Supper Club. Its basically unchanged since it was Herremans Supper Club and continues to boast all the hallmarks that make our states iconic restaurants so great. However, unlike some of the more stringent supper clubs out there, the Chophouse actually does lunch service and thats what we showed up for this Friday. The lunch Fish at the Watertower features a 1-piece cod for $7 or a 2-piece for $9. Since one piece is a little ridiculous most everyone in our party of five went for the 2-piece, with Jeff adding a $3 trip to the impressive-looking salad bar. While the waitress was a little hit and miss, the fish arrived quickly and in good shape. This was our second visit to the Chophouse, and while our first visit was only a couple months prior the cuts of cod were already noticeably smaller. They were probably around 3 oz. each, but still high quality and tasty. The highlight of the fish was its flavorful beer batter which eased the pain of the portion somewhat. While the 2-piece was decent it certainly would have been nice to have an option for more. I would gladly have ponied up the dough for an $11 3-piece. While the fish is fine and the salad bar looks stupendous the real standouts at the Watertower are the sides. There are tons of scrumptious sounding options to choose from and I (again) chose the potato pancakes. The cakes are likely the best of the bunch, and if theyre not the other options would be inexplicably amazing. Served with a side of apple sauce, the rich, flavorful cakes are very impressive and produce an unrivaled taste sensation. They are easily some of the best weve had anywhere at any time. Finishing off the fish was a thick and creamy homemade tartar sauce. It provided a real punch which pushed the cod further across the delectability spectrum. Unfortunately, no bread came with the fish and it didnt appear as though there was any on the salad bar either. A sassy slaw did make the soirée though, and brought a good bite that finished things off with a bang. While not overly plentiful, every element of this Fish Fry was crafted with care. It was a tidy little plate of joy and everyone in our party left satisfied  quality food tends to do that. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry, and are happy to see another of our states classic supper clubs back in action.

The Sun Prairie staple simply did everything right, from streak to salad bar, and of course, Fish Fry, they were Class A all the way. After they shut er down a place called Babas, tried to fill their shoes, but met a similar fate after only a few short months in business. Next in line was Harrys which seemed destined to fail. The spacious restaurant sat vacant for a number of years after that, only to be reopened on Mothers Day 2014 in the form of the Watertower Chophouse.The Watertower is striving to be everything Herremans was and more. They offer a sophisticated menu of steaks, seafood, chops, and on Friday an ambitious Fish Fry. We showed up for lunch when the only fish on special is cod, but during dinner time lake perch and bluegill can be found as well. The lunch affair consists of two pieces of Icelandic Cod for $9, although there is also a 1-piece available for $7, but cmon1-piece? We were there right when the doors opened at 11:30 and had the undivided of Kevin, the outspoken bartender, throughout. He had our fish on the bar within 10 minutes of ordering and we got right to business. The two chunky pieces of pristine cod were cloaked in a moderately-thick, Guiness beer batter that was rich and flavorful. The fish was clearly high quality, fantastically flaky, and pure white. It was well-balanced, but due to the thickness of the batter some grease was smattered about. We turned them periodically to keep it from settling too much, but despite our diligence the second piece did have some soft spots so if youre a slow eater you might be in trouble. Regardless, the fish received high marks, but could be even higher with a few subtle tweaks. There are several sides to choose from, but for us the choice was an easy one  potato pancakes, please. The latkes were lavish and easily some of the best weve had to date. They were incredibly salty and onion-y and gave us a real kick in the pants. Not many places around Madison put the time and effort to make the traditional side, especially when most feel the fries will do, and these babies are certainly gonna help the Chop House stand out in the crowd. Our one petty complaint? We would love to see some apple sauce or maple syrup on the side *hint hint* Some near-perfect tartar put the finishing touch on the dynamic fish with its thick and creamy consistency. It had the perfect relish ratio and improved the cod in every way possible. No bread comes along at lunch, but at dinner time a romp through the salad bar would assumedly avail starch seekers of some. The cup of slaw that did accompany the cod was almost perfect and made up for the missing bread. It was sweet and zesty, and beautifully balanced. If all slaw was like this stuff everyone would love slaw. The supper club renaissance is in full swing, and I have a feeling well be seeing a more places like the Watertower popping up here and there. Although the dinners are on the expensive side you supposedly get a lot for your money, and leave feeling satisfied. We waded in for lunch, but will definitely take the plunge after 5:00 one of these days to sample the freshwater fish and the salad bar. Overall, we highly recommend the fried cod we had for lunch at the Watertower, and think youll love it too. www.watertowerchophouse.com109 W Main StreetSun Prairie, WI 53590     (608) 318-1857",3423,0.1648815628815629,0.5012722832722833

Spring Creek has every kind of freshwater fish commonly associated with Fish Fry and do every one of them incredibly well. They are bosses of bluegill, lords of lake perch, and wizards of walleye; so naturally I got the cod...Im a rebel like that.Actually, the cod just sounded right this Friday; partially because Id eaten bluegill for lunch and partially because the 3-piece is about five bucks cheaper than the cheapest freshwater fish on the menu and I was feelin frugal. The average-sized cuts of cod were as flaky as youll find and come coated with an incredibly light and crumbly breading. The airy fish retained the slightest amount of grease, but it served more as a lube than a soaker. Thus, the coating remained crispy and perfectly intact until the very end. A handful of thin, house-cut fries rode shotgun and were a breath of fresh air. While they werent as crispy as the freezer fries we see all too often, they were far more satisfying and much tastier. Spring Creeks tartar also had the skills to pay the bills, but the zippy mix ran out slightly before the fish did. Basic dinner rolls do what basic dinner rolls need to do, but the places that really care go a little further. The multigrain roll at Spring Creek is definitely a step up from grandmas basic bun and makes it known that they are in it to win it. Their homemade slaw is also a winner with plenty of pop and a noticeable hint of horseradish. The creek-side building that houses the Spring Creek Restaurant & Bar has changed hands a few times over the years, but hopefully it remains in these capable mitts from now on. Its arguably the finest incarnation yet with the some of the tastiest fish the area has to offer. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and will be back for more soon.  www.springcreekrestaurant.com/118 S Main StreetLodi, WI 53555     (608) 592-0600",2021,0.17747425997425997,0.466010296010296

This place is really marking its territory.Back in August our indoctrination began with the bluegill. Then in September we got close up with their cod. Both were nothing short of spectacular so come January we knew wed be pleased with the perch, and we were. The $15 perch plate is as well-executed as they come especially when yours is the first order of the day. The plate looks remarkable when it arrives. Its clean and carefully laid out, clearly copious amounts of care go into its preparation. Five pretty perch take center stage with their eye-catching, light yellow breading. A small amount of seasoning is carefully mixed in and allows the fish to shine, and shine it does. Its smooth and flaky with no odd aftertastes or unexpected flavors. Overall, its very solid although another dash of garlic salt or pinch of pepper would definitely do it some good. Winning the Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role are a stellar batch of battered fries. The pile is absolutely huge with a satisfying crunch. They are fried just right and keep you crunching well after the fish supply is exhausted. Thick and creamy tartar is the coup de grâce when it comes to fried fish and the Spring Creek sauce finishes things off with a bang. Its got a lot of zip and transports the fish from admirable applicant to the total package. A finely-chopped homemade slaw is carefully placed into large cup and is just an all-around good mix. A nice little multigrain roll caps things off and provides a palate cleanser between mouthfuls of fish. While Lodi is a little out of the way the drive to the Spring Creek Restaurant & Bar is worth every mile. Overall, we highly recommend each and every fish they have one the menu and love the fact that you dont have to wait until Friday to enjoy them.

I mean, why should I blow the cover off a great Fish Fry if it means that it will be more difficult for me to get later? Why would I risk exposing a hidden gem to my own detriment? I guess I just cant help myself and feel an overwhelming need to be completely honest. Man, am I ever a sucker. While the general populace hasnt caught on yet, the Spring Creek Restaurant in Lodi is quietly killing it. They do a Fish Fry every day of the week, but still, youd expect them to be much busier on a Friday. They arent. We showed up at 6:30 (the peak of the frying hour) and had no trouble getting a table. It was kind of surprising, but who am I to complain? I knew great fish was on the way. On our last go-round I went for the bluegill and was blown away by the quality and the taste. It was all I could do to not simply get it again, but I wanted, no needed, to branch out. I had to see what the cod was all about since that is what almost everyone (other than me) likes the best. I managed to get a $10 3-piece ordered before I could change my mind, and a wave of relief rushed over me as I did. The food came quickly and had a lovely, clean presentation. The cod was pure white, flaky, and clearly very high quality. It housed a crisp panko breading that was lightly seasoned and completely grease-free. Although the portion was hearty it was very easy to eat, and so light that I didnt feel weighted down at all afterwards. I could easily have eaten five or more pieces of the fantastic fish. A small but satisfying portion of battered French fries came along for the ride and had a congenial crunchiness. The tartar was also yummy and paired beautifully with the pristine cod. It was a match made in heaven. The SCR steps it up when it comes to bread and their soft, multigrain roll is a welcome departure from the standard dinner roll you find at so many other establishments. It had some substance but was still easy on the gums. A finely-chopped, homemade slaw was plenty peppy and polished off the plate perfectly. While Id love to keep the Fish Fry at the Spring Creek Restaurant a secret I just cant do it. This is one that everyone needs to know about an experience for themselves. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and love the fact that they offer it every day of the week   it will make it much easier to get once word finally gets out and they get crazy busy on Fridays.  www.springcreekrestaurant.com/118 S Main StreetLodi, WI 53555     (608) 592-0600",2532,0.25593500273672687,0.5469919266557196

Perhaps not surprisingly, Fish Frys have a tendency to do the same thing. Sure, the best Frys can stick around for years, but some of good ones cant survive the competition. Theres a place up in Lodi thats had that exact problem.The restaurant in question started as Nick and Willies (or something like that), which eventually shut down and reopened as The Spring Creek Tavern. It wasnt long before the Tavern failed too, only to reopen as Willies Wet Spot some time later. Apparently Willes wasnt the spot to be either and closed up shop after only a few short months. The creek-side restaurant sat idle for a bit after that, only to be reincarnated as the all new Spring Creek Restaurant & Bar earlier this year. The SCR has Fish Fry every day of the week, but we showed up on Friday when we assumed theyd bring their A game (and the certainly did). Cod, lake perch, and bluegill are all on the menu and we chose the bluegill as we so often do when given the option. We also opted for the clam chowder which came before the fish and had 3-4 real clam strips and a zesty, creamy flavor. It was a tasty rendition that we would definitely get again. The fish came right after we polished off the chowdah and looked amazing. Nine fillets covered the plate and varied in size from small to large. It had a subtle bluegill musk with a crispy, well-seasoned, beige breading. It was incredibly well-balanced and really kept you coming back for more. Great gill. There are plenty of potato options to choose from and we picked the battered fries instead of baked or mashed. The battered beauties came in a huge portion and had a satisfying crunch. They worked well with the wondrous fish making for quite the dynamic duo. A pert near perfect tartar also played it part with a thick consistency and zesty flavor. We slathered it on the fish which enhanced its subtleties in every way possible.A better-than-average dinner roll was also served and featured an appealing crust and subtle sweetness. Some nice, homemade slaw was finely-chopped and peppy and really finished things off right. Fish Frys come and Fish Frys go, but we have a feeling this one is going to stick around.

Normally we would never consider a place like that for a Fish Fry, but we heard theirs was great, and what many said was the absolute best in the Madison area. This we had to see for ourselves.Now, the Dells is clearly a family-friendly destination and Sarentos looks kind of fancy when you walk in, but its more of a faux fancy. There is a big bar to the right, a hostess station to the left, and if youre like us (a party of 7 including 3 kids) youll promptly be escorted to the Pizzareia (otherwise known as the basement). Mercifully, its a pretty nice basement with plenty of lighting and a couple flat-screens so it doesnt feel overly dungeonesque. The wait staff will be buzzing all over the place and we had waters and a basket of breadsticks on our table practically before we were all seated. The Friday Fish is cod and comes either fried or broiled for $13.00. Both include a baked potato or French fries, and a house salad, but the boiled also includes sugar snap peas (a bonus side for the broiled even though their the same price, whats up with that?). In addition a humungous bowl of clam chowder can be added for just three bucks. Since the breadsticks were the first thing on the table well start there. The sticks come whether fish is ordered or not and are soft, but not very flavorful. They reminded us of the kind served a Fazolis (is that place even still around), but sadly were probably not even that good. Conversely, the chowder was good, but mostly because of its abundance. It had much more potato than clam, but for $3 its hard to really complain. After the chowder came the house salad arrived (which is substituted for coleslaw whether you like it or not). The salad was a basic garden variety, but jazzed up with some garbanzo beans and cucumber cubes. It was just fine as was the vinaigrette style house dressing that accompanied it. This first course (if you want to call it that) all came in a flash, so it was a bit surprising when there was a noticeable delay with the fish  we figured itd be ba da bing ba da boom. When it did arrive it actually looked quite appetizing as four long cod fillets artfully graced the plate. The fish was cloaked in a golden colored batter that didnt do the so-so cod any favors. The batter had very little flavor of its own and couldnt save the fish which had a bit of a musty flavor. Overall, it was very run-of-the-mill and doesnt stack up to some of the other places out there. A zesty tartar could have saved the fish to some extent but the Sorento sauce was kind of boring and left us wanting more. The julienne-cut freezer fries were also unappealing mostly because the portion of them was teensy weensy. We realize everyone likes Fish Fry for their on reason and have fierce allegiances to their local spots, but this is one that we just dont get. There was really nothing special about it, and we cant really think of a reason to go back. Overall, we dont recommend this Fish Fry and would definitely go to the Del Bar instead. Their fish is the exact same price, and much better in our opinion.  www.sarentosrestaurant.com441 Wisconsin Dells ParkwayWisconsin Dells, WI 53965     (608) 253-3300",3240,0.20712691326530602,0.4392644557823128

Well, hip may be a bit of a stretch, but bb Js is definitely new and clearly the place to be on a Friday night in the bustling burb. For starters, there is a lot to like about bb Jacks so I can see why theyre drawing them in like they are. Its immediately apparent from the moment you walk in that they are as kid-friendly as they come. The whole main dining room is basically reserved for families while those without little ones tend to be seated in the dining spaces surrounding the generously proportioned bar. It is a good system in which keep the noise generated by the adults in one space, and the screams and exuberance of youth in another. Since weve had our baby with us on both occasions we have been subject to the back room, but that is far from a bad thing since youre with a whole bunch of people that are in that same boat. A full-blown fish menu is laid out on Fridays with cod, lake perch, and walleye (strips) all in attendance. The cod is a beer battered version and pretty standard as far as that preparation of fish goes. The fish is on the flaky side, while the batter is on the mild side. The coating rests somewhere in the middle thickness-wise, but isnt greasy or slimy in any way. It is an all-around solid rendition and one wed definitely try again. The perch, on the other hand, has a crumbly breading and a lot more flavor making it a little more desirable in my book. Ive yet to try the walleye, but from what I could gather it looks very well thought out (i.e. cutting it into strips makes it much easier to handle and raises the meat to batter ratio significantly). bb Jacks does house-cut fries, and while I normally cant resist fries that are done start to finish in-house, I have bowed to the Featured Side Dish: Cheesy Hash Browns on both our visits. These spuds are truly unique and have an incredibly dense, sticky, texture. They hold together like slowly-drying glue, are clearly loaded with real cheese and plenty of cream making them a true gastronomic powerhouse. If these babies dont put your GI tract to the test Im not sure anything will. Some thick and creamy tartar comes with the fish and has a pleasurable pop that blends seamlessly with the beer batter. A small slice of toasted garlic bread, and a cup of creamy slaw round things out, and while the garlic bread is a little strange to see next to a Fish Fry it is still pretty tasty. The slaw is pretty much just slaw, but does everything a slaw should do. bb Jacks is relatively new, but they seem to carving out a nice little niche for themselves. DeForest is a bedroom community to be sure, and as such is a great place to raise a family. Thus, you are going to have a lot of young couples with young children that want to get out for fish on Friday at a place where they feel welcome. bb Jacks is that place.

When they say theres a new place with a great Fish Fry that I havent been to yet I really listen. When they elaborate and I realize its a place Ive been to that closed but reopened anew I dont just listen, I get over there the first chance I get. bb Jacks is a place like that.bb Jacks in DeForest used to be Swansons Supper Club and some friends I are partook in their Fish Fry back in 2011. While we felt it wasnt exactly a supper club we thought the Fish Fry was decent enough, although we werent completely surprised when they closed. bb Jacks doesnt claim to be a supper club, and theyre not, which is just fine by me. bb Jacks has a more modern feel than its predecessor and a slightly better Fish Fry too. Of course, they have cod, but the rumor was the $13 lake perch was the way to go so I went that route. The featured side this Friday was cheesy hash browns, and while I really wanted to try their house-cut fries how could I pass up a special like that? I couldnt, but being the connoisseur (glutton) that I am, I ordered a side of the fries too. I dont care what mom would say. Our waitress was good and had the fish on the table in no time. The perch was the real deal (yellow perch), but was slightly fishier tasting than youd expect. These fishy overtones were masked for the most part by a light crumbly breading that had a pleasant flavor with an adequate amount of seasoning. The cheesy hash browns were ultra-cheesy and quite tasty, but sat in my belly like a rock. Maybe I ate them too quickly because they were so delicious or maybe it was just copious creaminess in a massive portion, but whatever it was they were hea-vy. Ugh. As advertised, the fries were cut in-house, and much better than the standard Sysco freezer fries. Further quelling the pungent perch was a thick and creamy tartar sauce. It was pretty basic but flavorful enough to cover the im-perch-fections and make for an overall pleasurable experience. A nice slice of garlic toast and some tasty slaw (that didnt appear to be Sysco) came on the side and offered exactly what theyre supposed to  a change of pace without stealing the show. Play on, players. While the ketchup on the table was House Recipe (the Sysco name brand) this isnt what Id call a Sysco Fish Fry. Everything appeared to be made fresh in-house and while Sysco products might have been used in their construction it wasnt a slapped together pre-battered afterthought kind of deal. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and will definitely give it another shot hoping for some less fishy tasting fish.

The original spot on Regent Street has been a Badger football Saturday staple ever since taking over from Luedtkes Oakcrest back in the day, and definitely knows how to draw them in. When Sweet Sophies closed and reopened as Luckys Waunakee we werent the least bit surprised to see them doing big business as well. The owners have the clean-cut sports bar thing down to a science and really know how to work it. Apparently they have a strong desire to expand the brand even further by venturing into new, more supper clubby markets. They recently took over the defunct Anchors Away up in Okee and are in the process of revamping the entire operation into Luckys on the Lake.Full disclosure: we showed up for lunch as construction was in progress (they are doing a massive expansion) and only the remodeled portion of the original Anchors building was operational, makeshift bar and all. We took one of the many open tables and waited for the lone waitress to come over, which took quite a while considering there were only two other parties in attendance. Eventually she swung by, got us some beverages, and took our orders. Luckys has a 3-piece cod for $11 and a $15 perch on special although the perch said it was a 2-piece which makes me think it wasnt yellow perch (the true lake perch). We, of course, went for the cod since all the fish are beer battered and beer battered freshwater fish is not our thing. In addition to all the standard Fish Fry accoutrements LotL gives patrons a soup or salad option too. We chose the chowder over the greens and it was thick and hearty brew. While there wasnt much clam, the base was very zesty and set the stage perfectly for the fish. A basket of cellophane-wrapped breadsticks and supper club style cheese spread acted as props and wound up being a huge bonus (although they unfortunately didnt come until after the fish was served which was disappointing). Three bulky pieces of fish finally arrived bringing with them a thick beer batter. Moderate amounts of grease oozed from their substrate but the fish was pure, flaky, and white. In our opinion, the batter was average at best as it really didnt have much flavor of its own. It necessitated tartar, but thankfully there was plenty of the sauce to spread. Luckys tartar was a good mix, and helped the fish as much as it possibly could. It had a little bit of zip which gave the fish a boost and while it wasnt the thickest it wasnt the thinnest either. Some thick, Julienne-cut fries sat in a lump under the fish and were under-fried but still tasty. Push. A nice half-slice of light marble rye added a necessary jolt to the meal and the creamy coleslaw finished things off with a well, lets just say it finished things off. This is an interesting Fish Fry as the peripherals were all plentiful and well-executed, but the fish, fries, and tartar (the heart of the Fry) were all average at best. While we are curious to see what LotL will look like when all the remodeling is said and done, we have to assume fish wont change. Overall, we barely recommend this Fish Fry and appreciate all the thought that went into it, but are awaiting a smoother execution and more alluring fish. We think they have it in them although their track record isnt exactly glowing.  www.luckysbarandgrille.com/W11579 Highway VLodi, WI 53555     (608) 592-5825",3390,0.12578803255032767,0.5298884630851843

Its not often that several of these worlds collide, but when my family goes out for Fish and it winds up being at a hockey rink I have to think the planets have somehow aligned just for me. This Friday everything was in sync.Truth be told, I had no idea that Willie Tys was located in the same building as the swanky new ice arena in Sun Prairie, but when I checked out their website and saw a Friday Fish Fry listed I knew what had to be done. In all honesty, had I known it was adjacent to the hockey rink I would have been there much sooner, probably on opening night as a matter of fact. The Fish Fry at Willie Tys is only served for dinner (after 5pm) and goes for $12. When we showed up at 5:30 this Friday the place was pretty busy, but there were a few open tables. It was also well-staffed, and probably over-staffed for how big the place really is. We somehow wound up with the worst waiter in the bunch, but despite his aloofness our food still came quickly (I credit the kitchen for that). A 3-piece cod is the only fish offered, but its a well-reasoned special. It has an extremely unique batter with what appeared to be a buffalo wing sauce in it (in fact I think there may have been some Franks Red Hot in the mix). It boasted a really great flavor which complemented the cod canvass very well. It was quite enticing, but there was a problem  grease. And not just a hint of it, but enough that it saturated the batter on pieces two and three. Despite my efforts to turn them throughout, little could be done to keep the coating intact. While the grease wasnt a total deal breaker (since the batter was so flavorful), if they can somehow eliminate it they will have a true winner on their hands. Plenty of thick, julienne-cut fries played the supporting roll and were nothing special, but there was nothing wrong with them either. They did just enough, but the tartar did so much more. Willie Tys mix was thick and creamy with lots of pop and just enough relish to let you know that it wasnt just mayo. They specialize in aioli at Willie Tys so youd expect the tartar to be crackerjack, and it is. The only detractors being that it was $0.75 for an extra ramekin (which was necessary) and the cup wasnt quite big enough to fit the wide cuts of cod. Like missing an empty net Willie Tys failed to provide any sort of bread with the Fish Fry. While I knew that was the case going in, it doesnt make it any less annoying. Their unique, but funky slaw didnt help matters either as it lacked flavor despite the obvious attempt to avoid that fate. It was roughly equal parts carrot and cabbage, and tasted like they were going for a chipotle-cumin kind of thing, but it just didnt manifest that way. Oh well. I love hockey and I love Fish Fry so any time the two meet its going to be a huge winner in my book. I can only imagine how great sitting down to a cold beer and a Fish Fry would be after a good skate and really hope I get to do that someday. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry despite a few shortcomings and will definitely come back to see if they can get rid of the grease. Greasy goals are one thing, but greasy fish is quite another. www.willietys.com/836 Grove StreetSun Prairie, WI 53590     (608) 318-1057",3342,0.05752794383746764,0.49409457385647865

We liked almost everything about The Place and their Fish Fry, with the exception being the fish they were frying (which was Tilapia). We hoped that as they grew their Fry would evolve to offer a real Fish Fry fish instead of the less desirable oceanic variety Lo and behold it finally did.A name change ushered in a new era in Brooklyn Fish Fry as the revamped Holstein added a fried cod option to their menu. While there are still a couple versions of Tilapia to choose from (with the Parmesan variety coming highly recommended), we, like almost everyone else we overheard ordering, stuck to the cod. The $12.29 cod is a 2-piece affair, but like any gluttonous Fish Fryer we felt the need to ask if we could have an additional piece to which they happily obliged. Had we known the extra piece was going to be $4 more we may have thought better of it, but as they say, live and learn. While the overall price tag was kind of steep everything was homemade and prepared to order so its not totally unjustified. The fish itself was good and clearly high quality. The pieces were large (in the 4-6 ounce range) and flaky as can be. The pure meat partnered with a light batter that had a great texture but lacked any discernable flavor. The delicate coating also concealed a moderate amount of grease which seeped forth from its hiding place once its restraint was punctured. Regardless, it was still serviceable and we had no problem gobbling up all three chunks. Sucking up some of the seepage were the Julienne-cut fries that lay beneath the fish. They were a small but resilient bunch, although unlike everything else, didnt appear to be homemade. While they would have been well portioned given the standard 2-piece, they ran short long before we made it to the third piece of fish. Luckily, the thick, creamy, homemade tarter lasted until the end and enhanced every bite of the fish it touched. It had plenty of pop, and was brawny enough to conceal every drop of grease it encountered. It was pretty much ideal in every way and brushed away any blemishes with ease. Holsteins homemade slaw also did the job with a uniquely sweet twinge that really livened up the whole meal. It also paired perfectly with the slice of thick caraway rye on the side. While its not a supper club, and there was no relish tray beforehand, Holstein did offer us a nice little sampler and soft cheese and delectable salami which we gladly accepted. It was a nice way to start the meal and made the slightly higher-than-average prices more palatable. We really enjoy the farm-to-table concept and the care that Holstein puts into their food, but mostly were glad they added cod to their Friday menu. The owners clearly love their restaurant and have listened to the community they serve. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and think Brooklyn has something to be proud of in Holstein.www.holsteinrestaurant.com233 Douglas DriveBrooklyn, WI 53521     (608) 455-1115",3038,0.23543854991968205,0.54091834789948

Caityn used to babysit for one of our mutual friends and we met her and Cale at another friends wedding (details of that night shall go undisclosed). That said, they had no idea we were coming in this Friday, and we had no idea as to whether they would be working or not. It turned out Caitlyn wasnt even in town, but Cale did stop to say hello after wed gotten some of our food. Despite the acquaintance well keep this review as unbiased as possible.For starters, Wendigo has a great modern atmosphere that would fit right in with the nicest gastropubs in Madison, or even Chicago for that matter. We were pretty early for a Friday night since we had our baby in tow, and there were several tables available (these would quickly fill up throughout the course of our dinner). We started with some of their-soon-to-be-famous cheese curds which were simply superb. They were gooey and stretchy yet feathery to the touch, clearly hand-battered to order, and served with two sauces (ranch and Sriracha aioli) that played off each other perfectly. All very well executed. We barely had a chance to finish the scrumptious curds before the fish slid into place. While ocean perch is on the menu it usually falls short when stacked up against a good chunk of cod so you know which route we took. The cod goes for $12 and is a 2-piece affair with each being a hefty 4-5 oz. The fish was on the high end quality-wise and had a wonderful white flakiness. The pristine meat was home to a relatively light batter that was similar to that of the curds. The coating was good, and 100% grease-free, but didnt really have much flavor of its own. Still, it was quite enticing and both pieces were gobbled up with ease. While most everything at Wendigo is made in-house the fries were not even though we expected they would be. They were the basic thick, Julienned, freezer numbers and were well fried, but the sort weve had 1000 times over. Three sauces came in three separate ramekins: one ketchup, one tartar, and one sort of shrimp sauce like entity. The tartar was the standout of the trio with a noticeable pep and the correct proportion of mayo to relish. While it would have been adequate on its own it was nicely offset by the horseradish pop of the shrimp sauce which was a unique addition for a Fish Fry offering a nice change of pace from bite to bite. The last item on the plate (save for an unused lemon wedge) was a big cup of pink coleslaw. It was red cabbage based with a creamy, sweet flavor and some other indiscernible elements. Even the cream had a rosy hue and while we suspected beets played a roll we really couldnt be sure. Generally, it was tasty and bore a striking resemblance to the pink stuff served on the salad bar at the Aztalan Inn.As with any place getting their feet wet (and any new Fish Fry for that matter) some things are bound to get overlooked and at Wendigo the bread went missing. Hopefully theyre on the lookout for it. For being the new kid on the scene Wendigo is already doing a lot of things right as far as their Fish Fry is concerned. Aside from a pinch of salt here and a slab of rye there everything was accounted for and very well executed. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and think it makes a great addition to the dining scene in Stoughton. And the curds? Well, they just might be worth the drive on their own. www.wendigostoughton.com121 E Main StreetStoughton, WI 53589     (608) 205-2775",3536,0.25020815295815296,0.4804345839345838

Sometimes its about trucksbig trucksand 14 month olds. 14 month old boys love big trucks. Thankfully the Pine Cone has big trucks, and a big old Fish Fry too.No matter what kind of fish you fancy the Pine Cone has you covered. Today our desires fell on the lake perch and at $11.50 its more than a square deal. Regardless of what fish is chosen a few sides from their long list will come beforehand. The homemade chowder, while thin on clam, is thick on taste. Its rich and creamy, and while the clam is hard to come by there were at least a few bits here and there. Plenty of potato filled the void and kept the little man almost as satisfied as the passing 18 wheelers. The roll is ridiculous (in a good way) - you have to see this monster to believe it. Grandma would be proud. While none of the fish weve had at the Cone have lived up to our first visit (due to a lack of seasoning) it has all been good enough to recommend. This lot of four fillet wasnt outstanding, but even average perch makes the cut as long as its the real deal (and the Pine Cone perch is). The highlight is their crispy, fried chicken-like breading, that has a consistent crunch even is the seasoning is anything but. As a truckers oasis the Pine Cone knows hash browns and these babies could easily satisfy the most road weary travelers with their ample American cheese and ominous onion slices. The mashed potatoes are rich and creamy and equally satiating - accompanied by a ladle full of gravy that apparently has all the salt the fishs breading ia lacking. While some might think two potato sides is downright nutty, we think the double shot of spuds is the way to go seeing as weve tried the other sides and found these to be far and away the best. Thick and zesty tartar always has a home at the Fish Fry and the dueling pleated paper cups at the Pine Cone did just enough to give the fish the boost it needed. The Pine Cone isnt sexy, the Pine Cone isnt chic, and the Pine Cone really doesnt give a crap. They care about one thing, and one thing only: good food at a great price, and on that front they deliver (and then some). The amount of food you get for the money is downright ridiculous making this place a definite truckers delight. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry, and how could we not? Good fish at a great price, and a way to entertain a 14 month old for hours. Thats priceless in our book. www.pineconerestaurant.com6162 Highway 51DeForest, WI 53532     (608) 249-8778",2558,0.173125,0.508888888888889

Most places have phased out AYCE altogether and those that still have it charge a mint because they know people are going to take advantage of it. Its a tight spot for restaurants to be in, but if youre like the Pine Cone squeeze is your middle name.The AYCE is served all day long and since the Cone is open 24/7 I assume that means from midnight to midnight. Furthermore, its not just AYCE fish, but chicken as well ($1.50 more for all white meat). The bottomless portion comes with one of their signature massive dinner rolls and three sides of your choice. The list is lengthy but this time I chose the slaw, baked beans, and French fries (which actually arent on the list, but they seemingly could care less about substitutions). The slaw and roll came first but since its AYCE and I wasnt about to fill up on bread I pushed the soft bun aside and took it home. The slaw was the creamy variety (although it was quite watery), plentiful in portion and horseradish quotient. It was not great by coleslaw standards.  The baked beans arrived along with the fish and fries, and were pretty basic all things considered. They were slightly smoky, and easily edible, yet Id still take a can of Bushs any day. The fries were about as boring as they come and served in a surprisingly small portion considering the gargantuan servings everything else comes in. The cod was easily the star of the show, although more of a B List celebrity than red carpet material. It was a good, solid rendition, but a little plain all things considered. While I loved how flaky the fish was, the light and crispy breading was under-seasoned and didnt do it justice. It appeared to be the same coating that was on the perch a few weeks back, but that rendition was heavily seasoned and ultra-crispy which really took the perch up a tick. If nothing else, the cod was consistent from round 1 to round 2, and had I been there for dinner instead of lunch I certainly wouldnt have hesitated to get a third helping. Youve got to take advantage of the AYCE, right? The saving grace for the under-spiced fish was the Pine Cones thick and creamy tartar which is served in the little McDonalds-style ketchup cups. While theyre impossible to dip into, theyre fun to grab and squeeze which is really the only way to get the necessary amount onto the fish. At this point weve been to the Pine Cone three times and have met with mixed results. The perch from our first visit stands head and shoulders above the walleye and the AYCE cod, although we do give the cod some bonus points since it is AYCE. The sides have also been hit and miss as the slaw is so-so, the beans are basic, the fries are forgettable, the potato pancakes didnt perform, and the chowder is commonplace. Overall, we still recommend this Fish Fry, but will likely order the perch with a side of hash browns (or possibly mashed potatoes and gravy) from here on out since that has been the best combo thus far by far.  www.pineconerestaurant.com6162 Highway 51DeForest, WI 53532     (608) 249-8778",3120,0.03998015873015873,0.45444444444444443

There simply cant be anything special about their food and its certainly not some kind hidden gem, right? Well, not exactlyThe slip of paper inserted into the menu with the Friday specials says it all. The Pine Cone takes their Fish Fry seriously: AYCE cod and chicken (a little extra for all white meat), lake perch, walleye, and even a combo platter lay it all out. The AYCE is cheap too, coming in at $10.50, while the perch and walleye are just an eyelash more at $11.50. While weve yet to sample the cod, the perch and the walleye are both well worth the price (especially the perch). Included with the fish is your choice of three, count em, three sides. The finely-chopped coleslaw comes in a massive dish and is highlighted by a hint of horseradish. The clam chowder is rich and creamy, heavy on the salt, and presumably straight out of a big old tin can. Its tasty enough just not as good as some of the homemade chowders weve had around town. The side salad is something that really should be avoided especially considering the other quality options. While it is a hefty portion of iceberg lettuce, ours was watery and browning, only slightly salvaged by the incredibly heavily seasoned croutons. Garlic bomb! This salad would surely make a vegetarian weep, but as a wise man once said, You dont win friends with salad. You win them with fish. In addition to the trio of sides a gargantuan dinner roll comes along for the ride. This thing is so massive it requires its own plate and even that barely contains it. Presumably made fresh in-house, it is warm and yeasty and available in a six-pack on your way out the door if you simply cant get enough. Its the biggest, the baddest, the doughiest, the everything-est dinner roll weve ever had the pleasure to sink our teeth into. The Cone kicks out food like MC5 kicks out the jams and your overflowing plate of fish will likely arrive before youve finished your salad or slaw. The perch is an impressive lot as four fat and meaty fillets lure you in immediately. From all accounts its the real deal yellow perch and comes bathed in a crispy, fried chicken-like breading. While it looks like KFC extra crispy, it isnt overbearing and actually pairs quite elegantly with the moist fillets underneath. The walleye filet is average sized and has a similar breading although with slightly less seasoning (or maybe it just varies by the day, we cant be sure yet). Ours was flaky but a little dry and slightly over-fried. The choice of sides includes several potato options and while weve yet to try the fries or the mashed with gravy, the hash browns and the potato pancakes have found their way into our belly. The hash browns are aces (as you might expect them to be at a truck stop). The spuds are coarsely grated, served in a plentiful pile and for an extra buck fifty slathered with two slices of American cheese and large onion chunks. The potato pancake (yes, singular) is an interesting rendition to say the least as the large pancake is thick as can be but without much flavor. It necessitated the accompanying apple sauce but also came with a huge ball of butter on top much like a traditional pancake. It was a little odd. Both the perch and the walleye come with two tiny paper cups of thick and creamy tartar which barely suffice, although Im guessing a place like the Pine Cone would be happy to provide more if requested. The mix is rich and zesty, and puts a nice finishing touch on the tasty perch, and covers up some of the imperfections in the walleye. The Pine Cone isnt necessarily known for their Fish Fry, but maybe they ought to be. Were not sure how many places out there deliver more bang for your buck, but we know its not many. While the walleye could be better, the perch is pristine, and from what weve seen the AYCE cod and chicken looks like a force to be reckoned with.

I'm not sure what it is with Next Door. I want their Fish Fry (and their beers for that matter) to be so good, but just they never are. It's tough, since I love their vibe, their style, and their 'hood, but when the product doesn't match the aesthetic it's hard to swallow.NDBC has $9  cod, $12 perch, and $17 walleye available all day on Friday, and since all of them come beer battered I stuck to the basic cod (since that's basically the best fish when beer battered). The 2-piece I received was middling at best. The beer batter had zip for flavor and while the cod was long and thin it was maybe a couple ounces per piece.After I saw it, it made sense while it was only $9 - there just wasn't much to it. While the fish fell flat the frites blew up. The house-cut spuds had the perfect fry job and really stood out among the crowd. The cup of tartar on the side took the fish up a tad but was odd to say the least. It was thick (which is a plus), but had tiny chunks throughout, almost like a Parmesan peppercorn. Of course, there was no bread, and I died a little inside. The slaw was clearly made in-house and had notable black pepper overtones that dominated the flavor profile. While it wasn't bad in the least, it wasn't necessarily something I'd seek out again. At this point I'm not sure what I can do... I want to like Next Door, and the food on their normal menu has been good enough, but I think I need to cut ties with their Fish Fry. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.

It is so close to being great, but it just doesn’t get there and it makes me kinda sad.Today we stopped at Next Door for lunch and the specials were a $9 cod or a $12 lake perch, which seems like a square deal, but man, the portions are TINY. First off, there is no bread so let’s just get that out of the way. Next, both the cod and the perch are served as a 2-piecce (yes, a 2-piece perch, you heard that right). Both share same APA beer batter as well and come with a maple glaze, which is something no one else does (and probably for good reason). MFF Jr. hated it the glaze, but I thought the sticky substance was acceptable and made the fish unique (at the very least). Both fish seemed to be of decent quality with the flakiness you expect, but there was just so little of them it was hard to get a good read on it even at a petite price.The best part of this Fry were probably the house-cut fries which were plentiful when compared to the fish and pretty much spot-on all around...skin-on, supple, stupendous. If only the fish could live up to them. If only…A ramekin of tartar with a twin ketchup sat confidently atop the plate as if to say, we’re here and we are perfectly ready to serve you. The sauce was on the thin side, and more ranch-y than mayo-y, but still improved the fish. Its subtle sweetness offset the glaze to some extent and although it was thin, it stuck to the slippery fish well.Keeping with a recent trend, the slaw was stupendous. I’m not sure if I’ve just warmed to it over the years or what, but it seems that I’ve had a ton of great ones recently. This mix was pungent, and although simple, it tasted fresh with a smattering of lettuce to coincide with the crunchy cabbage.It’s hard to judge any place based on a single visit and I wanted to think our first trip to Next Door was just fluky, but after a second time I feel like I’ve got a pretty good bead on it. I’ve been teased by their alluring atmosphere and promise of “neighborhood favorite” perch, at the end of the day the portion is just way too small. Overall, we still don’t recommend this Fish Fry, and although there are a lot of element we like about it, they’re not the most important ones.www.nextdoorbrewing.com2439 Atwood AvenueMadison, WI 53704     (608) 729-3683",2315,0.13773665223665224,0.5153562610229276

While we love beer batters (at least the good ones) we know that they can go south and go south quickly. When places put such an emphasis on the batter it has a tendency to get thick at which point the fish becomes an afterthought. Its a fine line to toe, but the places that know to take their foot off the gas tend to have the best fish. Thats just the way it is.The (relatively) new Next Door Brewing Company on Atwood recently dove feet first into the Fish Fry pool offering cod ($12.50) and lake perch ($14.50), both beer battered of course. Since freshwater fish is best when lightly breaded we stayed away from the lake perch, instead opting for the cod where beer batter makes a lot of sense. The place was none too busy at 6:00 so our food came quickly. It actually looked really nice although the fish appeared to be greasy. In actuality it wasnt greasy at all but rather comes with an unrequested drizzling of malt vinegar. The vinegar didnt ruin the fish by any means, but it was certainly unexpected. The 2-piece was a little undersized especially at $12.50. The cod itself was flaky and moist, but for being a brew pub the batter was surprisingly uninspired although not overly thick. While there wasnt anything wrong with the fish in general there was nothing to set it apart either. Highlighting the meal were Next Doors house-cut fries. There were lots to pick through and each hit the right note. The Julienned potatoes were well-fried with the skin-on leading to plenty of pleasurable crunching. Some thin but tasty tartar was more of a sour cream/ranch hybrid than a true mayo/relish mix, but it got the job done to some extent. It made the fish better and thats half of the battle right there. The slaw mixture was house-made and unique as the come. While it wasnt real creamy it wasnt vinegar laden either. Despite its indefinability it had a good balance and was inoffensive. Its one of those that wed definitely eat more of it but wouldnt seek out. There was no bread served with this Fish Fry. Bummer Next Door Brewing Company is our kind of place. In fact, we used to work in the building right next door to Next Door back when it was the Appliance Service Center and certainly would have patronized the brew pub frequently had it been there at the time. The cod itself was kind of hit and miss and while it was perfectly acceptable we dont see ourselves rushing back in for it. Overall, we dont recommend this Fish Fry, although it is right on the cusp. www.nextdoorbrewing.com2439 Atwood AvenueMadison, WI 53704     (608) 729-3683",2673,0.17857244956301557,0.45790247488360697

Whether you venture up to Lake Wisconsin or prefer to just hang out on Main Street there are Fish Frys everywhere. Oh Lodi, how lovely thou art.The newest addition to the Lodi Fish Fry scene is Dales Place. We were at Dales not all that long ago when it was Dolphins Pub and nothing has changed all that much with the transition. The bar is still long, the one wall is still lined with booths, and the Fish Fry is still really good (and one heck of a value all things considered). Dales fish of choice is haddock which goes for only $11 (broiled for $1 more). I was on the backend of the lunch rush so there were a lot of orders in front of mine, but the Spotted Cow was crisp and cold an I had no problem with just sitting back and watching some fancy schmancy cars roll across the floor at the Barrett Jackson auction while I waited my turn. The fish eventually showed up after Id downed beer #1, so I ordered a second and dug in. The fish was good and without the slightest hint of grease despite a semi-thick batter. The beer-laden barrier was pretty plain and the haddock was just haddock, but there was nothing wrong with it although nothing that set it apart either. Dales homemade tartar comes in a mammoth squeeze bottle, and features an equally hefty amount of dill. While the consistency was good and the sauce was essentially unlimited, the dill quotient was a bit high. It neither helped nor hurt the fish in the long run. While the fish was fried on time the fries were forgotten so as they took their oil bath I turned my attention to the baked beans and bread that arrived along with the haddock. Baked beans are always a welcome addition to a Fish Fry and this little dish had some hamburger in the mix which was a bonus on top of bonus. The ciabatta-looking bun was squishy and delicious and a definite step up from a regular roll. About three minutes (or 1.5 pieces of fish) in the fries and coleslaw finally arrived. It was a little slapdash to say the least, but not the end of the world by any stretch of the imagination. The fries were pretty basic, skin-on Julienne cuts, but in the haste to get them out some wound up being way over-fried. The slaw was clearly made in-house and while it was ultra-creamy it was a bit odd to say the least. It had golden raisins, I repeat, RAISINS throughout the mix. It was a little strange to say the least, and while Ive never witnessed such a thing, they didnt totally ruin the zesty blend. They gave the slaw a unique texture, but by the end I found myself picking around them. Hey, maybe you love it when raisins show up where you least expect them, but I for one gotta say I like my slaw raisin-less. Sorry, Dale. Dales Place is yet another in the long line of admirable Fish Frys in Lodi that just seem to go on and on. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and definitely see ourselves swinging back in for it someday. This is a solid Fry.  www.facebook.com/dalesplacelodi111111 South Main StreetLodi, WI 53555     (608) 592-2777",3047,0.07676053113553113,0.48812306283460116

There are those that simply love its all-inclusive atmosphere, and others that decry it as a liberal hellhole. These feelings are pretty much par for the course for anything in the Willy St. neighborhood, and while I tend to enjoy the tavern it's not somewhere I'd put high on the list of places to take my parents for example. Mickey's also doesn't have a classic Fish Fry every Friday (so call ahead to ensure they do this week), but when they do it's definitely a treat.Mickey's fish of choice is cod and has been prepared a couple different ways when we've been there. On our previous encounters it was dusted with a light, superbly-seasoned breading, but this meeting we found a benevolent beer batter instead. Like the breading of yesterday, it had a superb flavor, but was much more decadent and pillowy. The twin cuts of cod were hefty, although not too hefty to handle, and made for a substantial amount of meat. The stark white flakes of fish paired remarkably well with the spongy shell and made for a tasty and satisfying meal. To my knowledge Mickey's was the first in Madison to do the whole ""Sexy Fries"" thing and while the homespun favorite isn't available with the Fish Fry the regular fries sufficed. They were skin-on freezer jobs, fried crispy, and basically just like the Sexies without all the sexy stuff on top. A zippy, yet thin, tartar had enough oomph to make things noticeable although the rich fish did overwhelm it a bit. Gluten-free is the name of the game with the enlightened crowd and those that think they are in-the-know must not realize that any traditional Fish Fry comes with some sort of starch (either that or they just don't care). While the lack of bread wasn't totally unexpected at Mickey's it as no less disheartening. Oh well. A sizable ramekin of their signature red pepper slaw did come along for the ride however, and was as unique (and as peppery as they come). Literally, the only thing you can taste is the red pepper, but hey, if you like the taste of bell pepper this baby is for you. I'm guess just okay with it. If you're going to Mickey's you just need to know what you're getting into, and on most Fridays what you're going to find is a damn good Fish Fry at a damn good price. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and Mickey's Tavern in general. The fish won't have you seeing red and the price certainly won't give you the blues either. www.facebook.com/MickeysTavern1524 Williamson StreetMadison, WI 53703     (608) 251-9964",2523,0.22794708994708993,0.5471485551485552

Ebbs and flows. Ups and downs. However you describe fluctuation its undesirable at a Fish Fry. On Friday consistency is king and the best places have no problem churning out plate after plate of flawless fish. Its a hallmark of the greats and after two impeccable visits we had Mickeys Tavern on the verge of joining that exclusive club...HAD being the operative word.While the fish at Mickeys this time around was far from a total bust, it was also miles away from the excellence we expected. On our other visits the cod was billed as a Proper Fish Fry but today it was listed as Uncle Franks Fish Fry. While we cant be sure if the name change indicates a different preparation there was definitely a difference in the taste. Regardless of the name, Mickeys Fish Fry is a 2-piece affair. While the Proper version was salty and robust, Uncle Frank must have a restricted diet as the sodium quotient was dialed down significantly. The batter was still light, and satisfyingly crispy, but really suffered from the lack of seasoning. In addition, the cuts of cod were less than pristine and without the full-bodied batter it was hard to ignore its shortcomings. Mickeys knows fries whether theyre Sexy, Super Sexy, or just the regulars that come with the fish. This batch was fried to perfection and all-around alluring. Mickeys also has a talent for tartar and while this cup wasnt as zippy as weve become accustomed to it was no slouch either. Perhaps Uncle Frank has an aversion to zest as well? You wont find any bread with the fish at Mickeys, but some of their scrumptious slaw makes an appearance. The vinegar-based blend is plenty pungent with subtle bits of heat here and there. Theres some spice in that there slaw! When it comes to Fish Fry variability is public enemy #1. If you have a great fry somewhere you want it to be the same each and every time you go back and that wasnt the case with this visit to Mickeys. Overall, we still recommend this Fish Fry, but not quite as highly as we did previously. Hopefully Uncle Frank gets a little more proper next time around.www.facebook.com/MickeysTavern1524 Williamson StreetMadison, WI 53703     (608) 251-9964",2207,0.16024603174603175,0.5157460317460316

As the epicenter of Madisons counter-culture the neighborhood proudly endorses this reputation wearing it as a badge of honor rather than letting it serve as some sort of stigma. The attitude prevails at nearly every establishment up and down the street, culminating on the easternmost end at Mickeys Tavern. More often than not proper isnt going to be one of the words you find amongst Willy Streets descriptors. Proper connotes an uptight, stuffy, traditionalist mentality, which Willy is anything but. However, Mickeys isnt afraid of the term, at least as far as Fish Fry is concerned. While Mickeys always has a Friday fish special, it isnt always their Proper Fish Fry, but when it is hungry patrons are in for a treat. Mickeys fry is only $10, which is an appropriate price for a Fish Fry of this size (although Id gladly pay a couple more bucks for it if thats what they were asking). Two generous pieces of flaky cod are offset by a crispy, heavily-seasoned beer batter resulting in a very well balanced offering. Its a salty sensation that makes your mouth water in anticipation of each bite. Its simply great all around. Adding even more sodium to the bloodstream are a sizeable stack of Mickeys super-seasoned fries. These spuds are crispy, savory and potent as all get out. While theyre surly too intense for some folks, a saltaholic like me simply cant get enough. When fish is this pungent only the boldest tartars can stack up and Mickeys deluxe sauce does the trick. Its ultra-creamy and zippy as can be which helps to quell the seriously salted cod. The only part about this Fish Fry that really isnt proper is the fact that Mickeys stiffs you on the bread, but luckily their homemade slaw actually makes up for it somewhat. Its a zesty vinegar-based blend that is as diverse as they come with a hint of heat from time to time. Its a good one.  In such a diverse and eclectic neighborhood its great to see a place that can still pull off a traditional Fish Fry. The fish, fries, tartar, and slaw are all superb, and while theres no bread its such a minor oversight with this one that I could really care less. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and think its only proper to do so. Its a current favorite of ours.  www.facebook.com/MickeysTavern1524 Williamson StreetMadison, WI 53703     (608) 251-9964",2487,0.20816378066378063,0.5783080808080808

Its quite the remarkable little Fry. Not only does Mickeys make some tasty fish, but they only want 10 measly skins for it. 10 skins!Its one heck of a deal, and a deal we wish they had every Friday. Mickeys is as much tavern as it is restaurant (if not moreso), but they really do take pride in their food. Our fish came within 10 minutes of ordering and looked pretty great despite a few fryer basket indentation. The fish is cod and its pretty outstanding. Its fall-apart flaky with a great texture and a breading to die for. This breading is heavily seasoned with an absolute pantload of salt. Regardless of the sodium quotient its still light and crispy and really keeps you going back to your bottle of beer (Ale Asylum Bedlam in this case). We loved every delectable morsel and only wished there was more of it to be munched (even though the portion was plentiful). This is great fish, and did we mention it would be nice if they did it every Friday? Mickeys claim to fame are their Sexy Fries which are hand sliced potatoes tossed with white truffle oil, Parmesan cheese, chives, and crushed red pepper, but if we learned anything this Friday its that their regular fries are plenty sexy. The portion is gigundo, the spuds are perfectly fried to a satisfying crunch, and doused with a mine full of salt. They are simply salivary and paired perfectly with the potent cod; and guess what? They have them every Friday (and every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday for that matter). Good fish can stand on its own, but an outstanding tartar can put even the greatest of fish over the top. Mickeys home brew is thick and creamy with just the right amount of zing. Were surprised they dont have it more often, like every Friday for instance. Mickeys is also proud of their homemade slaw and the crisp, vinegar-based rendition has plenty of contrast. It comes with far more than just the fish so you know they take stock in it. Its a great change of pace and more than makes up for the lack of bread. It took years for us to get to Mickeys but it certainly wouldnt have if they had their Fish Fry every Friday. Its quite a nice little Fry and one that we really enjoyed.

I want to like every Fish Fry I eat and I want them all to be great, but I also understand places have a desire to be unique and to stand out from the crowd. I applaud these efforts when they work, but sometimes they just dont, and The Spots Fish Fry just didnt.The Friday Fish Fry at The Spot is what Id call a fancy one. Its not the typical beer battered cod, or even a lightly breaded perch; its pan-seared walleye, and not even a full piece. For $14 three small chunks pepper the plate equaling roughly 1/3 of a total fillet. The soup du jour is clam chowder and anticipating that the fish might be skimpy I grabbed a cup. It was clearly house-made, but not great by any stretch of the imagination. The fish followed shortly after and featured a light, flour breading. It was extremely delicate and wispy  definitely fork food rather than finger food. While the flavor was decent there just wasnt much of the fish to love. The petite portion of fish needed some help, and the aid came in the form of a stupendous tartar sauce. It was clearly made in-house and had a uniqueness that is rarely seen. It was sweet and peppery with a great twist that kissed the silky fish ever so gracefully. Two thick and fluffy potato pancakes with a pleasant texture beefed thing up somewhat, and while they lacked the traditional oniony flavor, they were a very classy rendition nonetheless  very well executed. The cakes are accompanied by a homemade mango apple sauce that was a very nice addition, although the mango didnt really come through (which is 100% fine with me  not a fan of mango). A vinegar-drenched, red cabbage slaw was basic but beautiful at the same time. If you dont like vinegar slaws you wont like this one, but I love the pungent stuff so it gets a pass from me. No bread came along which shouldnt get a pass from anyone, especially me. Mildreds was one of the first places I fell in love with in Madison and Im glad to see its rebirth in the form of The Spot. While Mildreds was straight-forward, microwaved sandwiches on pita bread their unique flavor combinations were endearing. I hoped The Spot would take a cue from its predecessor, but they may have jumped that shark with their Fish Fry. While its definitely an attempt to class up a classic it works on some levels but not all as the portion is too small regardless of the quality of the preparation. The potato pancakes are good, but again small by all standards. The tartar is aces, and the slaw gets the job done for vinegar devotees, but foo-foo rarely wins in Fish Fry and this one might be a little light in the loafers.

These guys have been great all year and when the Big 10 Tourney rolled around I figured theyd dominate the competition and I went to Monks with some coworkers to see them do just that. They struggled with a scrappy Michigan team from the opening tip, and unfortunately the Fish Fry did the same.In the end Bucky recovered and closed things out strong as a couple key contributors really stepped up  there were no such heroes for the food. The cod is available as a 2-piece for $12 or 3-piece for $13 and features a light beer batter. The coating is flaky, but thats about where it ends. Its devoid of flavor and home to a notable amount grease. It was wispy and crispy and nearly fried to the point where it fizzled offfortunately it was pulled at just the last moment. The portion was generous and likely totaled 8-10 ounces, so thats a plus I guess. Lots of battered fries bounced around the basket and were not bad at all. While I expected a little more seasoning from their appearance it never manifested. Some middle of the road tartar was completely necessary and absorbed by the brutish fish. The single cup failed to go shot for shot and ran short while the cod still had plenty of legs.  Like most everything else at Monks the coleslaw needed a good kick in the pants. It was pretty uninspired; creamy but not creamy enough, fresh but not fresh enough, decent but not good enough. Not serving bread with a Fish Fry is the equivalent of missing am open layup and Monks needs a little work around the rim. The 2014-15 Badgers are an impressive team and proved it today against Michigan. Much like a great Fish Fry each guy knows his roll and contributes in his own way. Monks Fish Fry was more like Michigan  some decent parts but far from a championship contender.

The noise of the nearby highway 14 crept in along with the spring breezes for you see Bay 5 really is the 5th Bay of an industrial building right near the road. While that might seem strange (and it kind of is) it makes for an interesting but not unpleasant dining experience. Furthermore all those vehicles and the hullabaloo were Shangri-La for our 15 month old. Trucks, Trucks, Trucks!For being in a garage Bay 5 has a surprisingly upscale menu. Its locally focused with some interesting twists on Wisconsin classics. We started with a ½ order of the curds and the pillowy puffs were nothing less than superb. The ½ order was larger than the full order you find at most places and served with a smooth ranch that itself was sprinkled with grated cheese. The curds werent cheap but were worth every penny; the fish on the other hand totally broke the bank. The sushi quality Icelandic cod is listed at $15 for one piece, $20 for 2 pieces, or $25 for 3 pieces. That sounds like a lot, doesnt it? I have to agree. While the pieces are pretty large they still dont really justify that price. Since Im not a millionaire I went for the 2-piece and felt a little guilty even doing that. The cod was definitely as high quality as advertised. It was white as a sheet and as flaky as weve seen. Despite its smooth flake it hung together remarkably well. Usually flaky fish just falls apart but this stuff wanted to be wholeit needed to be whole. The unblemished fish featured a light batter that had some seasoning evident. The blend appeared to be have some dill included and while too much dill can easily overwhelm a fish this pure this dill faded elegantly into the background. It was great fish, but Im not sure its $20 great. Fries or baked potato are both available and for twenty clams I figured Id get some sort of house-cut greatness. Unfortunately all that came with the fish were a handful of thick-cut freezer fries which were fine, but every bit of basic. I guess maybe I expected too much based on their food philosophy, but I dont think Im alone in that assumption. Its rare to see tartar sauce served without a container (be it cup or a big squeeze bottle) but Bay 5 just puts a big old dollop on the plate and calls it a day. While the unbridled sauce was hard to scoop it was thick and creamy with a pleasant pop that complemented the cod well. A nice little football shaped roll passed the test, but again, was nothing unique to justify the price tag. Some homemade slaw with a crisp, clean flavor also came with the fish and also contained a subtle amount of dill that added more than it detracted. All in all this is a pretty nice Fish Fry and Id gladly pay $13 for it. $14 would be pushing it and $15 would be a stretch, but $20 is just too much all things considered. When you take into account Mazomanie is a good 30 minutes out of town there is just no way we could justify coming back for itgarage door or not. Overall, we dont recommend this Fish Fry, but that is mostly due to the steep price tag and not the quality of the food. I guess Im just not a sushi kinda guy.

Gotta have thatwait, on second thought, nevermind, you can have the Funktheir Fish Fry anyway.Funks Pub was once Naminios (which we never went to) and before that Byrds (which we did go to). Byrds was nothing special fish-wise and sadly, Funks isnt either. While Funks fish does show some promise the execution is lacking. Cod and perch are both on special on Friday and since I clarified that it was indeed lake perch thats what I ordered. It was a lie, although not necessarily a bold faced one. Funks $10 perch is one of the yellow perch imposters, most likely Zander or pike-perch. The entire order is comprised of one, count em one, piece of fish (and it isnt even a big one). The solo swimmer came fast, and was freshly fried (props to the kitchen), but thats about where it ends.

It was a couple ounces at most, light and flaky with a surprisingly tasty batter, but way too skimpy for any real Fish Fry fan. The fries were the standard freezer jobs and just fine, although slightly under-fried. The tartar was a bright spot with a thick texture and zippy taste. It looked homemade and was really impressive, if only there was more fish to enjoy it with. A sweet and crusty roll added some much needed substance while a raw tasting slaw lacked a binding agent to really bring it together. It just wasnt appealing. A 1-piece Fish Fry isnt going to cut the mustard anywhere unless youre talking walleye, and the perch at Funks is no walleye. Despite the fact the fish tasted decent and the sides were respectable the portion was just far too small regardless of the price. Overall, we dont recommend this Fish Fry and dont see ourselves coming back for it at this time. funkspub.com5956 Executive Dr #101Fitchburg, WI 53719     (608) 442-9500",1920,0.21009253903990746,0.4974840948525159

Many restaurants in the area have it on the menu all the time while others have special catfish feeds throughout the year. In Madison catfish is a different story. The bottom feeder can be hard to come by as its thought of more as a Cajun or southern option rather than a true Fish Fry fish. Thus, the catfish you find in Madison usually isnt anything special. UsuallyThat BBQ Joint on Willy quickly made a name for itself on the Madison culinary scene with some radical ribs and bodacious brisket. We figured wed give it a try some day, but were more than a little surprised to see their sandwich board advertising a FISH FRY a few weeks back. We were less surprised when we found out catfish was the fish they were frying but knew we needed to get over there ASAP to see what it was all about. For $12 three big pieces of catfish hold court on the plate. Catfish has a tendency to be mushy and amorphous when deep fried, but the BBQ Joints had a nice flakiness and didnt get gelatinous or mushy at all. The texture held up throughout and paired perfectly with its crumbly breading. The crispy coating featured plenty of seasoning, and although you couldnt tell exactly what the spices were, they were exactly what you want. It well could have been the best cat weve ever hadits certainly up there. That BBQ Joint has French fries on their everyday menu but curiously none come with the Fish Fry. A couple hush puppies filled the void to some extent, but really cant compare. The seasoned balls of cornmeal were breaded and fried to a golden brown and quite tasty. They had a bit of heat on the backend that made them anything but bland and had us reaching for our water glass time and again. The tartar appeared to be straight mayo but there was definitely a little something buried in there. Like a ball of yarn the smooth flavor of the sauce played nicely with the feisty cat. No bread came with the Fish Fry, but two cups of slaw did. Thats right, TWO cups. Apparently they really want you to have both the creamy and vinegar varieties and while we appreciate the effort wed rather have a choice of slaw and side if fries instead. Anyway, the creamy slaw was good, and while it had dried cranberries in it there wasnt enough to overpower the mix. The vinegar version was much more diverse and had some jalapeño or something which lent it some heat. Both were equally enticing but in a different ways. As you might expect That BBQ Joint knows slaw. You see plenty of freshwater fish on Friday menus, but when youre in Madison catfish usually isnt one of them. Its a polarizing offering as some people just cant stomach the thought of eating a bottom feeder, but the open-minded among us know that when done right catfish can have an alluring essence that is truly memorable. That BBQ Joint does it right. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and with a few tweaks think it could be something special.  thatbbqjoint.com1511 Williamson StreetMadison, WI 53703     (608) 709-1300",3069,0.1668308702791462,0.4635262725779967

No one knows about it. No one talks about it. No one seems to care about it at all. And maybe theres a reason for that, but then again maybe theres not. Truthfully, I wouldnt have even known about it if it wasnt for their FISH FRY sign out front on Friday afternoons, but as soon as I found out about it I knew I needed to try it out. First and foremost the Varsity is a great looking bar complete with shuffle board, bubble hockey, foosball, pool, darts, and then some. There are also plenty of TVs and fruit machines, so you know there is fun to be had. On Fridays they have a $10 3-piece cod as well as a $12 2-piece walleye. Both come with all the basic sides.In all honesty, the cod looks pretty uninspired and delivers on that promise. The Sysco fish featurs a nondescript batter that has miniscule bits of pepper scattered throughout but is otherwise bland. The fish itself is more flaky than mushy and not too greasy although there might be a hint. The  walleye is the baby variety and is much better than the adult cod. It features a light breading rather than the beer batter although even it lacks seasoning. The fish is flaky, and quit meaty making for a much more pleasurable dining experience. There are plenty of sides to pick from, including regular fries, wedges, and bagged potato chips among others. The fries  are the standard Sysco skin-on freezer fries and come modestly portioned. There is nothing really remarkable about them save for the amount of salt they are slathered with. The sodium chloride is more than plentiful and while a salt fiend like myself could handle it, many would say they were waaaaay over-seasoned. The wedges were equally average although much lighter on the seasoning. While they appeared to have a Cajun style coating it didnt manifest that way. Regardless, they were plump and well-freid. When fish is bland it needs a potent tartar and this chunky blend delivers to some extent. Boatloads of relish and a smattering of dill dominate the mix and gives the cod the lift it needs, but is a bit much for the delicate walleye. While it doesnt really leave a lasting impression it is acceptable. A half slice of marble rye leaves a deeper impression and is an unexpected, but welcomed surprise. It has the stank you want and we really have no complaints save for the rock hard butter that accompanies it. The final piece of the puzzle is the slaw which has a huge horseradish blast and is above average in every way. Its creamy but not soupy, and potent but not off-putting. All in all this is a pretty solid Fish Fry. I actually liked the bar quite a bit and the food was decent all things considered. The cod was by far the inferior fish and I wouldnt come back for it, but the walleye is a different story. It was much more alluring and a fair deal at $12. Overall, we dont recommend the cod, but the walleye definitely makes the cut. www.varsitybargrill.com1205 W Main StreetSun Prairie, WI 53590     (608) 318-2729",3006,0.1671768707482993,0.5063317634746206

Although the well-known dining establishments can be tough to define we all know what the supper club is and why they are so celebrated. Most supper clubs have been around for ages but once in a while a newcomer emerges on the scene. Cross Plains has seen such an emergence.While Jodis bills itself as a Bar & Grill it is really more of a supper club lite. What was once merely an average bar called Sheltons is now so much more; its well worth the drive into the country especially for those dining with a vegetarian and young child. For the Fish Fry fans they have bluegill ($15.00), lake perch ($14.00), haddock, walleye and some other options as well. Its a great variety of fish, all of which include the compact salad bar which is short in length but long on options. Unlike many of the old school supper clubs Jodis goes beyond the basic iceberg lettuce with a fresh bowl of mixed greens featuring romaine and spinach. Four tubs of dressings follow, along with two different rolls (white or pretzel varieties), potato salad, cottage cheese, coleslaw, and plenty of the other usual suspects including that fluffy green marshmallow looking stuff. For being a small bar it is impressively stocked although there is no pickled herring of chocolate mousse. With so many fish options on the table narrowing the field is difficult, but the pan-fried bluegill is a wise choice. Eight or so generous fillets come caressed with a light - almost transparent - breading. It has a bevy of flavor, highlighted by plenty of pepper and a smattering of salt. It pairs elegantly with the delicate bluegill which itself was devoid of any off-putting fishy flavors. Like the fish, there are plenty of potato options, the best among them possibly being the potato pancakes. Only one cake comes with the order, but the lone soldier is very solid. While it lacks the traditional oniony essence, it does have a certain something that is tough to discern with an almost creamy or velvety sensation. The tartar also holds its own as the thick and creamy blend is clearly made in-house. While a Sysco coffee maker is prominently displayed in the dining room, it doesnt appear anything on the plate comes pre-prepared including the tartar. Not only is the fish at Jodis great, but they have some impressive options for vegetarians, as well as a nice big patio out back complete with horseshoe pits and plenty of space for the kiddos to run. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and will definitely be back, more than likely on a Wednesday for their $10 AYCE walleye feedyes, you read that right - AYCE walleye for $10 on Wednesdays!

We all expect outstanding fish at the supper club or our favorite tavern but rarely do we expect much, if anything, from a bowling alley. Bowling alleys are for bowling not for eating after all, right? Theres just no way a cook at a bowling alley could care enough about the dining room to make a good Fish Fry is there? Maybe there isSchwoeglers Sugar River Lanes is way out in Belleville, but those up for the drive will be rewarded with a tasty Fish Fry at a great price. For under ten bucks diners can choose from beer battered, baked, or Cajun cod or get fancy with a shrimp & cod combo. We sampled the beer battered and the Cajun and were pleased with both offerings. Good beer battered cod starts with (as you might imagine) a good beer batter, and this is. Its clearly a special recipe that plenty of thought went into. Its dark and smoky with a really delectable flavor reminiscent of the Tip Top Tavern in Madison or the Hooterville Inn in Blue Mounds. The three pieces arent huge, but arent skimpy either, and thankfully those with big appetites can add more for $2.50 a piece (which I would probably do next time around). The Cajun cod was equally good if not even better. While it was baked, it was a far cry from the typical boring broiled loins sprinkled with paprika. It was robust and dynamic and could easily be eaten with or without the drawn butter that accompanied it. While standard crinkle-cut fries are available I had a feeling the homemade cheesy hash browns were the way to go and I was right. They were rich and creamy and clearly head and shoulders above the other options. Partnering with the cod was a plain-looking tartar with a complex taste. While it looked like straight mayo it had a hint of relish and a sweet tinge that brought out the smoky flavor of the cod even further. A small slice of fresh French bread rode atop the cod like a white knight aboard a dark stallion. While it was just bread it was just enough. The scoop of slaw on the side had a nice hint of horseradish to go along with its creamy texture. Schwoeglers Sugar River Lanes shows that a great Fish Fry can show up just about anywhere as long as youre willing to look for it. The cod was great, the sides were thoughtfully prepared, and the price was definitely right. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and will definitely try to strike out at Sugar River again. sugarriverlanes.com807 River StreetBelleville, WI 53508     (608) 424-3774",2525,0.2119129720853859,0.512101806239737

I was raised Lutheran and while I don't actively go to church anymore I don't disparage those who do practice their religion. I was never really ""good"" at Sunday School so for me it's all just became a part of the bigger picture. It's not a focus in my life and when a parochial school has a Fish Fry fundraiser I figure it's okay to have a little fun with it...apparently others don't agree and take offense to some of my wordplay and puns so I'll try and tone it down this time around. These reviews are supposed to be informative first and foremost and I'll do my best not to offend anyone since I really don't want to catch hell like I did the last time (OK I'll stop there, I promise).The Fish Fry at St. Pete's is still one of the best AYCEs around (when it's offered - see their website for details) and I like to get over there once during Lent every year if I can. Your $12 experience usually begins with a line of people out the door, and some cheap beers while you wait in the hallway. Don't be discouraged though, the line moves quickly and once you reach the end (the basement) you are seated and eat immediately. Everything in the basement is served family style (including the seating) so get ready for some fellowship with strangers. Everything basically hits the table at once, shepherded by students from the school. Any good Christian knows the drill - grab some fish and pass it to your neighbor, grab some fries and do the same. The fish is good, although a bit of a mixed bag. Since there are thin cuts and thick cuts entering the fryer at the same time, the thin pieces have a tendency to get over-fried. The move here is to stick to the thicker pieces if you have the option as those have a tendency to remain juicier. While the breading seemed to have less seasoning than that in our memory, it still held strong to the meat and harbored no grease. St. Pete's used to go straight crinkle fry, but the game has changed since last we communed. The new fries are a testament to their willingness to adapt to the times and feature a big battered crunch. Once the bowl is drained the kids keep 'em coming and I must have eaten 80 of the sticks if not more. The tartar on the table is still a little thin and lacks punch, but still slathers the heck out of those cod loins. Some finely-chopped coleslaw had a basic vinegar base and a pleasant pop. It was a great addition and a nice departure from the creamy concoction we remember. Oh yeah, there is corn too...bonus! Rounding things out are some factory white bread slices which are nothing fancy, but thank the Lord are still there, and milk or coffee for those who want something other than cheap beer. If there is one thing I remember from the Sundays of my youth (aside from the Packers stinking) it was the whole forgiveness of sins part. We all make mistakes and it's up to us to make things right and I hope I've done that to some extent. Like I say, the whole goal of these reviews is to share information about amazing Fish Frys and St. Pete's has one of the best around. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and think they rise to the occasion each end every time. stpetermiddleton.org/parish/fish-fry/7129 Highway KMiddleton, WI 53562     (608) 831-4846",3317,0.14672683710419562,0.439197772877018

The fish was delicious as you would have it no other way. We enjoyed each and every one of the eight pieces you blessed us with, and had no qualms about baptizing them in your thin, but ample tartar. We give thanks for you generosity and sense for spices. Of course, we cannot overlook the abundance of crinkle-cut fries thou hath provided. Their numbers filled our bellies with good nature, and filled the void between rounds of your cod. We thank you for your staunchness with the starches and appreciate the baked potato option thou hath graced us with even if we doth not eat it.

My day of worship falls on Friday rather than Sunday, and varies from place to place. I pay homage in supper clubs and taverns, and once in a while at an actual church. The Catholics at St. Peter in Ashton, while being devout Christians, are clearly also followers of The Fry. A handful of times during the year they draw a huge crowd of enthusiasts to one of the best all you can eat Fish Frys in the Madison area.  Being a good shepherd I put word out to my Fish Fry flock and let them know that they should join us as we partook in the goodness that is St. Petes. In these troubled times, with the go-go-rush-rush of modern day life, only the ever loyal Jeremiah and the benevolent Mr. Bina saw the light of The Fry. We met at the church right at 5 oclock hoping the Fish Fry gods would smile on us and favor us with a quick turnaround. Praise be to the loyal followers, the Lord smiles upon thee.Since we arrived right at the start (they serve from 5-8pm) we were able to cruise through the hallway relatively quickly. 30 minutes, and two MGDs later, we were downstairs and in the thick of it. We hit Table 8 with our temporary family and within a couple minutes the homemade bread, corn, and coleslaw revealed themselves. We all dove right in and grabbed a generous portion of each.The bread was billed as homemade and the plain white slices clearly were. The excessively finely chopped slaw was also likely homemade and suited my palate just fine, although it wasnt very zesty. The corn was just corn, but was a nice addition to the lineup and worth some extra credit. After clearing our plates of these forerunners we were assured the fish would be right out.  A couple minutes later the scalding hot cod made its appearance. I pulled three off the top and instantly went to work. This fish is ungodly good. While it is difficult to put your finger on exactly what makes the fish so good it is not difficult to eat a ridiculous amount of it. Both the batter and the fish were light and flaky resulting in almost perfectly tender filets that practically fall apart in your mouth. Our table got at least three full plates of fish delivered, each being hotter than the one that preceded it. Simply divine.While the fish is out of this world, the fries and tartar are good but certainly not on that level. The crinkle cut fries are served all you can eat, and were equally as hot as the fish, but there is really nothing special about them. The tartar was probably a little bit better than the fries but was very thin and really spread out on the plate rather than piling high. It is homemade and I suspect this thin mix is due to the addition of Ranch dressing which makes it tasty, but runny.After eating as much fish as I could eat I wasnt sure I would have room for the desert which was to follow, however, when the plate of homemade cakes made its appearance I quickly found space. The delicious cake, all the pints of milk you can drink, and the great service from parents and students alike help to round out this truly great Fish Fry.Overall, I highly recommend you check out St. Petes website and attend one of their upcoming events. When you take it all in, this is simply a fantastic deal. For $11 (tip included) you get all the fish, fries, corn, coleslaw and tartar you can eat, all the milk and coffee you can drink and a piece of cake to top it all off. This was yet another divine experience at St. Peter, I only wish we could have shared it with more followers of the Fish Fry.St. Petes which art in Ashton,Hallowed be thy Fry. Thy Friday come. Thy will eat fish, In Madison as we do in Ashton. Give us this Friday our weekly Fish Fry, And forgive us our overeating, As we forgive those who dont come to your Fish Fry with us, And lead us not into Filet-O-Fish, But deliver us from servers who make cheesy jokes. For thine has the cod, the fries and the tartar, That we would like to eat forever and ever.

I knew we were in for a busy one regardless of where we were went so I figured I’d do ‘em one better and head to Saint Peter Catholic School. We found out about this Fish Fry from a friend a couple years ago and quickly came to realize it is a local tradition and one of the best in the area. Saint Pete’s only serves from 5pm until 8pm so if you are used to eating late it can be a bit of a challenge to get there. We showed up about 7:30 figuring the line would be short and we’d slip right it. Think again. The line was practically out the door, which if you know the layout of the place, is really long. We grabbed a couple beers and headed to the back of the line to wait. Yes you heard right, you get to drink beer in the hallway of the Catholic school while you wait in line for fish. Now, that is Wisconsin right there.A few MGD’s and about 40 minutes later we had seen all the kid’s artwork we could stand and exited the hallway for the glory of the basement. This is no ordinary basement however, it is a Mecca of Fish Fry and merely entering gave me a good feeling. We were actually lucky, since it was just the two of us we got in at least 15 minutes quicker than if we would have came with a big group. As soon as we hit the seats the food hit the table. The first course was slaw, white bread and corn, all served family style and more than plentiful. We enjoyed our food with our temporary “family” and waited for the cod to make its appearance. The fish came out and was served ungodly hot. I grabbed three pieces up right away and went after them. It was fresh tasting, and delicious, fried just perfectly with a unique batter that was nothing short of phenomenal. The batter and fish were both tender and flaky and fell apart with little effort. After putting away the three good sized chunks I was only able to handle a couple smaller pieces on the next round which was alright because I knew dessert was coming and I wanted to have a little room.The crinkle cut fries are also served AYCE and are just what you expect to see at a Fish Fry. They aren’t going to blow you away but they are tasty. The tartar sauce comes in a big bottle but is straight forward and delicious, although passing it around the table does get to be a bit of a hassle. What is somewhat surprising is how well this Fish Fry is coordinated. Everything flows in and of the kitchen and dishes seem to be cleared as soon as they are used up. It is well worth the $11 price tag when you consider that you get: AYCE fish, fries, corn, milk, and a cupcake at the end (unfortunately mine was coconut). Not to mention there is no “waitress” to tip. We were lucky to get in when we did as I heard that about 20 people got turned away and missed their Fish Fry at St. Pete’s this Good Friday. I bet those folks show up earlier next year. Overall, this is truly one of the best places to get Fish Fry in Madison. It is well worth the short drive out the Ashton and the long wait with two dollar beers.

The venerable establishment has been slinging burgers since well before my shadow ever shown on the capitol city and will likely be doing so long after Im gone. While it still seems like they lost a little something when they were uprooted by the Overture Center way back when, they still draw them in like few others and grill some of the best beef this side of the Mississippi. Youll never hear me knock their burgers, other than the fact they are on the pricey side, but after having their Fish Fry for a second time I cant help but be unimpressed.For starters, I realize its technically Dotty Dumplings, but everyone calls the place Dottys so Im just going to go with that from here on out. Dottys Friday fish of choice is walleye and the basket runs fourteen big bucks. We were very early this Friday (as we so often are these days) and our fish flew out of the fryer. Unfortunately, it didnt make its way to our table with the same haste as it clearly sat for a few which allowed it to soften and become slightly limp. The two small fillets (small for walleye) were home to a relatively light beer batter which was good but far from awe-inspiring. I say the batter was relatively light because BBs tend to get thick in a hurry and this stuff still had some flake to it. The fish itself was decent, but in all honesty I cant be positive that it was actually walleye. The fillets were small, but not baby-pike small, and not big enough to be fully grown adults either. They were tweeners which made me think it might have been pike-perch or some other walleye-like species. Regardless, the overall flavor was good, just not top shelf and not very walleye-y. As a burger joint youd expect Dottys to know their way around a potato and their fries bear that out. While the skin-on spuds dont appear to be cut in-house they are fried to perfection and generously portioned.In my previous review I ragged on Dottys tartar for being ultra-dilly which really did the walleye no favors. This incarnation seemed to be less dilly than that in my memory and came in a mammoth cup  there is certainly no fear of running out. The brew had a good zip and complemented the fish well, and while the dill was dialed down in the sauce the quintet of pickles that came on the side more than made up for it. Wait, whats that you say, a side of pickles? Yep, thats right  a side of pickles. Weird, I know, but somehow charming. Of course, there was no bread with the fish, which is all too common in this day and age, so all that was left was the slaw. The mix did its job as it was thick and creamy, and from what I can recall had a hint of horseradish or somethingerother that made it more interesting. While I dont want this to sound like a total condemnation of Dottys Fish Fry I just left feeling like something was still missing. Overall, we dont recommend this Fish Fry and think that if you find yourself there on a Friday its probably best to just stick with the burgers.

We were going to meet some family members and take the drive to the Ding-a-ling Supper Club. The Ding-a-ling has been on my list for seemingly ever, and I was pumped - it was finally happening! Until...it wasn't. Something came up and they backed out at the last minute. I scrambled to come up with a sufficient alternative - The Fish Finder pointed to Angelo's in Monona, and off we went...we pulled up only to be greeted by a note on the door stating they were remodeling and the kitchen would be closed until sometime in July! Ugh. It was 5:00, the witching hour when you have a five year old, and I panicked. The wife was famished and didn't want to drive so we chose the next closest place with a Fish Fry - Waypoint. Truth be told, I'd had a couple decent Fish Frys at Waypoint so I wasn't too worried, but wasn't really confident in that decision either. Turns out Waypoint has totally lost their way. They still have cod, lake perch, and walleye on the menu, and the $16 perch piqued my interest, but as soon as I saw the plate any optimism quickly faded. The five fillets looked hastily scattered on the plate, and were lukewarm at best. While they were real lake perch, their soft, flaky texture was buried under an unpleasantly hard and crunchy breading. This crumbly tomb was supposedly ""Cajun"" style, but it had no spice, no flair, no flavor whatsoever. Looking almost equally unappetizing was the smattering of fries on the side. They were skin-on, but not cut in-house, and so scarce that they were gone in an instant. A thin ranch-like tartar didn't do a lick to help matters, while the lack of bread, and pathetic little scoop of watery slaw only sealed their fate. It's funny how fast a night can turn from potentially legendary to pathetically lame, but it's bound to happen once in a while. The $16 lake perch was a huge bust and everyone was pretty unhappy with the night. Overall, we don't recommend this Fish Fry and probably won't be back to Waypoint until we hear they've changed direction. www.waypointpublichouse.com320 West BroadwayMonona, WI 53716     (608) 222-0224",2121,0.020545977011494253,0.6129310344827585

The Hound gained instant acclaim for their Friday specials (specifically their cod) and have since spawned another restaurant called the Waypoint Public House in Monona. The Waypoint has its own Friday offerings which are akin to, but uniquely different from its Fitchburgian brother. I visited both places on the same Friday in order to draw a comparison between the two. You might be surprised at what I found. The first stop was lunch at the Flying Hound which consisted of lake perch and French fries. The perch costs a reasonable $13.50 and comes with everything it should except bread. Ive had perch at the Hound three times now and this was best of the lot although it was still exceedingly salty (and this coming from a guy who loves his salt). The fish was pliable and flaky, but all of the subtle fishy goodness was lost to the hyper-seasoned breading. It was simply overbearing and needed heaps of tartar to mellow it out, and even that couldnt quite do it. Tons of skin-on matchstick fries are piled next to and beneath the perch, and fried right to the sweet spot. They were golden sticks of deliciousness, but like the fish, salted more heavily than most people could handle. A unique house-made tartar accompanies the fish and has a good flavor. While mayo-based, it has much more in there than just relish. As an aside: there is a kids fish and chips available as well. Its one piece of cod, served with fries, and ranch dressing instead of tartar. Weird I know, but that must be what kids are in to. The Hound has some very interesting slaw which is clearly made in-house, but kind of runny. Much like the other items is also has a very unique seasoning applied. I couldnt say exactly what it was (coriander or something out of the ordinary), but it really overpowered the blend making for a very unbalanced dish. While I really appreciate all the effort the Flying Hound goes through to make their Fish Fry unique the heavy-handed seasoning gets to be a bit much. What we found at the Waypoint draws a stark contrast. Ive had the cod at the Waypoint in the past and thought it paled in comparison to that of that of the Flying Hound. This time I decided to try their $14.00 walleye and found it to be markedly better. For starters, the Waypoint (and the Hound for that matter) are both exceedingly accommodating to families with young children. They seat smartly to ensure families have the space they need without taking anything away from the experience of other diners. The food also comes quickly at both places which is a godsend when youre sitting there with a hungry child. If you have a kid you know what Im talking about. The Waypoint walleye fillet was on the small side, and covered in a dark and crispy coating that melded well with the flaky fish. Since it was clearly a young fish it didnt have any musty flavors or anything which allowed the breading to take center stage (which it did thanks more to its texture rather than its taste). Since it was small, it went fast but was still better overall than the salty perch I had for lunch. Both Point and Hound appear to serve the same fries although they more conservatively portioned at the dinner destination. The Waypoint tartar was noticeably different however, with more zip and much smoother consistency than its comrade. The Waypoint mimicked its sibling in that there was no bread provided, but stood apart from it with a peppy, much more balanced slaw. While the Flying Hound made my write-up in the Isthmus those many months ago, the Waypoint might actually have the better Fish Fry at this point. The perch at the Hound was again too salty, but I will say that of all the fish Ive had between the two places their cod is still the best. The Waypoint is doing a better job of striking a balance, and while the Hound has the highest highs, it also reaches the lowest lows. Overall, we still recommend the lake perch and the Flying Hound, but recommend the walleye and the Waypoint Public House more. Both are good, but staying on the beam is critical and Public House strikes the right balance. www.waypointpublichouse.com320 West BroadwayMonona, WI 53716     (608) 222-0224",4338,0.21505945353347944,0.4390819137572384

Then came the Flying Hound Alehouse in Fitchburg. Now theres the all new Waypoint Public House in Monona. These three sisters have surrounded the city with their suds and are doing everything in their power to put their stamp on the Madison Fish Fry scene as well  although some are clearly doing it better than others.The newcomer has cod (fried or baked) and walleye available all day on Fridays. The 3-piece cod goes for $12 and is a very respectable rendition. The flaky fish features a satisfyingly crispy and extremely crumbly, dark brown breading. The brawny crust basically rules the roost leaving the fish no choice but to acquiesce to its might. Despite the coatings dominance it isnt as stellar as it could be as it lacks the seasoning that would put it over the top. As it stands, its a step up from Free Houses fish, but a few rungs below the Flying Hounds exceptional offering. Lots of shoestring style fries attend and bring even more crunch to the party. Where the seasoning misses the fish it hits the mark on the fries making for pure munching enjoyment. The homemade tartar also strikes the right note as the pinkish sauce adds a little something the cod longs for. While it isnt as peppy as it could be, its uniqueness is welcome. This is a breadless Fish Fry and Ill leave it at that. The homemade slaw is also the take-it-or-leave-it type, although it is fresh and crunchy so theres that. Out of the three sisters the Waypoint might be the youngest of the bunch but already has a leg up on its oldest sibling as far as Fish Fry goes. A reasonably- priced, respectable cod will always play in this town and the Waypoints offering is all that and more. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and have to imagine it will improve incrementally over time. www.waypointpublichouse.com320 West BroadwayMonona, WI 53716     (608) 222-0224",1909,0.27742704826038156,0.5434664101330768

Some places have great fish and do so at a reasonable price, while other places have great fish but charge $17, $18, $19, or even more for it. Clearly the places that offer the good stuff at a good price have a leg up on the competition, and thats where they separate from places like Olivers Public House.Just so were clear, the Fish Fry at Olivers is really good, but at $18 is one of the most expensive out there. The fish of record is beer battered bluegill, but make sure to give em a call or check facebook ahead of time because its not available every Friday. Olivers is in a nice new building, but even that couldnt keep us away from the spacious patio this gorgeous Friday. The attentive waitress came over in a jiff and had a plate of home baked focaccia in in front of us not long after. The bread was airy and crusty, and when paired with the salted sweet butter started this Fish Fry off on the right foot. The fish followed about five minutes after the bread was gobbled up and looked kinda fancy. It was hard to tell exactly how many fillets were on the plate as they were strangely prepared. While they looked like butterflies they were eerily thin and perhaps just single fillets that were sliced down the middle. I really cant be sure, but either way they tasted quite nice. The beer batter was light and flavorful and didnt overwhelm the waifish fish. Not a hint of grease was present and the fish was clearly high quality. Olivers is pretty swanky and instead of French fries some American blue potatoes fill the role. They supported the fish admirably with subtle seasoning and while they were supple they didnt blow me away. In a word they were solid. While capers have the ability to ruin a tartar sauce, the homemade lemon-caper aioli (A.K.A. fancy tartar) was superb. It was zesty and rich with just a subtle hint of lemon and nominal capers. Its understated sweetness melded well with the delicate fish making it slightly more enjoyable. The homemade buttermilk slaw was also outstanding. It was fresh and flavorful and while it was light on the cream it was heavy on the flavor. It was easily some of the best I can remember. When most people think about a Fish Fry they think it will be cod will cost ten bucks or so. Any reasonable person knows that bluegill will be a few bucks more and most are happy to pay it. When any Fish Fry starts pushing $20 most are going to shy away and that is something we have to take into consideration when we rank Oilvers. While this Fish Fry was really tasty, and clearly prepared with care, we cant look past the fact that others cost far less and are almost, if not equally tasty. Overall, we still recommend this Fish Fry, but have to dial down the enthusiasm to some extent since its so pricey. oliverspublichouse.com2540 University AvenueMadison, WI 53705     (608) 819-8555",2941,0.21243828763828765,0.5167791245791247

While I always hold out hope that places in La Crosse or Eau Claire will deliver I know that the deck is stacked against me. In all honesty Im relieved to even find places that have fish even if it is just the standard beer battered cod. Through a brief internet search I stumbled upon Taverna Grills page and since it wasnt too far off I-94 and had some decent sounding vegetarian options I figured wed give them a shot. We showed up around 1:30 and found the place pretty much empty giving us our choice of tables and the full attention of the waitress. Within five minutes of sitting down I had a cold Cow in front of me and an order for a $12 3-piece in to the kitchen. The food came about halfway into the pint and looked chic on it modern, square plate. Being that it was 1:30 I was plenty hungry and dug right it. The cod was every bit of average as the moderately flaky fish was home to a basic beer batter that was nothing special. The crinkle-cut fries were also about as standard as you will find, although they were spiced up a bit which made the cold beer even more desirable. A small Solo of Sysco style tartar saddled up next to the spuds and improved the cod, but how could it not? In an effort to go beyond the basic a nice little slab of garlic bread accompanied the cod and was untraditional but a small step up from a basic dinner roll. A sizeable cup of slaw also played it safe and had a decent flavor, but no pop to speak of. When youve had as many Fish Frys as Ive had you get bored with the basic beer battered cod and French fries. Thats not to say that cod and fries cant be good, but there needs to be something done to make it standout. This is about as basic as any Fish Fry I have ever had.

You have to be joking, right? Actually no. El Poblano has a Fish Fry, and not just on Fridays. Whats even more surprising is how traditional it actually is. A lot of times when ethnic restaurants try to play the Fish Fry card things go haywire. Bizarre tartar or odd fish choices turn a simple meal on its head and make for a less than pleasurable experience. El Poblano keeps it simple: fried cod (or tilapia), fries, tartar, coleslaw, and a roll. Its so simple that it almost worksalmost. A $10.50 3-piece or $8.50 2-piece are on the menu all day every day, although if I were coming any day other than Friday I would certainly stick to the traditional taqueria-style Mexican fare. Despite the fact you might be getting fish, the standard chips and salsa come beforehand and are really good. The chips are thicker than most taquerias and the salsa has a good bite without being overwhelming. As per usual at Mexican restaurants the main dishes are prepped in a jiffy and come well before the chips run dry. The three pieces of cod were about 3 oz. each and very flaky with a yellowish batter. While the fish appeared to be of decent quality the batter didnt have much flavor, which came as a bit of a shock. It resulted in a bland rendition that was grease-free but not much more. The fries were thick crinkle-cuts and just the basic freezer to fryer type. Nothing special here either. A surprisingly good tartar joined the fold and was nice and thick with a traditional pop. Like the fish it hit the fat part of the bell curve, but little else. Also surprisingly traditional, was the thick and creamy coleslaw. It could well have just been Sysco (and it wouldnt surprise me if it was), but it did what it needed to do. There was no bread served with the fish, but the chips more than made up for it. By and large this was a decent Fish Fry, but about as basic as you can get. While it is surprising how traditional they tried to make it I think they played it a little too close to the vest. Adding a little ethic flair can be a good thing it its done right, and Id rather see them take that risk instead of going so conservative. Overall, we cant recommend this Fish Fry and would rather go back for the real Mexican grub or the bakery items that looked so pretty in the case.  www.facebook.com/ElPoblanoMadisonWI3737 Milwaukee StreetMadison, WI 53714     (608) 204-2642",2411,0.12823593073593073,0.4432900432900433

The original Stamm House was lauded for being one of the finest Fish Frys in Dane County for years and when 1847 opened in its place they had a rather large reputation to live up to. They attempted to recapture the original Stamm magic with a local whitefish Fish Fry which for one reason or another fell flat. After a few years of floundering (no pun intended) they scrapped the slimy whitefish for the more traditional cod and from the looks of things it's already paying dividends.The revamped Fish Fry goes for a reasonable $13 and is comprised of three petite pieces of the aforementioned cod. These are well-prepared pieces which start with a pure and flaky fillet. From there a light beer batter is applied and fried until it's golden brown. Like the best batters, it's not hefty and ours didn't get greasy. It also had a pleasant flavor with a subtle smoky undertone. By and large it was excellent with the only problem being the size of the pieces. While there were three of them the they probably didn't even quite add up to the weight of most place's 2-piece. A marked improvement in the fish didn't mean the same for the fries as the skin-on Julienned potatoes were s surprisingly plain. They were still plenty enticing, and this is the kind our kid adores, so I can't complain too much. Some house-made tartar tagged along with the fish and while it wasn't runny, it wasn't clingy either. It was more of a scooper than a dipper, but the light zip and sweet flavor let the fish star. The slaw was also surprisingly simple, and about as inoffensive as slaw gets. It was easy to eat, but hard to love, and just kind of an add-on. A nice basket of very warm French bread was anything but ordinary however. The slab was cut 3/4 of the way through and melted any butter that graced its steamy surface on contact. It was a great opening act, whether you were eating fish or not. 1847 definitely figured something out here, and while it's not a unique Fish Fry anymore I'll wager they sell 10x more of it than the whitefish. And hey, if you're feeling more adventurous there is still walleye and lake perch on the everyday menu, and while both are cost prohibitive, the walleye is apparently a whole fish...that's two fillets! That's a lot of meat... Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and think 1847 is finally earning back some of that original Stamm House swagger. www.1847stammhouse.com/6625 Century AvenueMiddleton, WI 53562     (608) 203-9430",2627,0.2540539157811885,0.5633661944116489

One day its sunny, and the next it is gray. One day youre sailing free, the next youre stuck in the bay. One day youre swooning over what you think is a great Fish Fry, the next you come to realize it was all in your mind. What a difference a day makes dining at 1847, you find yourself in hell when you expected to be in heaven. Hell is too strong of a word obviously, but for the sake of the rhyme its what Im going with. Our second visit to 1847 at the Stamm House was far from hellish, but the angelic voices we heard on our first trip were nowhere to be found. The Friday special at the revamped Middleton spot is still $16 and still locally sourced (Lake Superior is as local as you can get, I suppose). Its also still whitefish, which isnt traditionally a frying fish, and this visit it became apparent why. To be blunt, the fish simply wasnt as good this time around. As someone who appreciates the fishier flavors of our native freshwater species (like yellow perch and bluegill), this whitefish was over the top. It was much more pungent than that of our previous encounter and had a silvery sheen of skin left on it. Whats more, the lone fillet also wasnt fried long enough so the batter was more pliable than crispy. The resulting flavor missed the mark and left me wondering what had happened as last time we were in the thick of it, and this time we were literally the first fish order of the night when the oil should have been fresh and screaming hot. While the fish fell flat the frites were as excellent as ever. The house-cut tubers were fried just right  par fried then flash fried - and made for an excellent accompaniment for fish. The side we got for our son came with the same tartar as the fish, so I guess its aioli all around at 1847! You wont hear me complaining as this sauce is thick as glue with a creaminess that masked most of the flaws in the fish. It was a very diverse mix, but when it get served with multiple things I guess it had better be. 1847 is a classy place and as such a nice little basket of crusty rolls precedes the fish. The buns appear to be made in house, and come warm with a crock of whipped butter. They are delightful. The last piece of the puzzle was their homemade slaw which was weird (if I do say so myself) and had a fruity essence that did nothing for the cabbage nor the carrots. Im out on that. What a difference a Friday makes. I have no idea what happened this time around, but this trip was a total regression from our stellar first visit.

It was a dark period in our history, but something big was looming and bright skies were on the horizon. It took a while for a new owner to see the potential, move in, and totally revamp the place, but all that waiting was worth it. The new 1847 at the Stamm House is a treat. I had a strong desire to visit 1847 the day they opened, but decided to let them get their feet wet before putting them to the test. Truth be told, I was hesitant to try the Fish Fry at 1847 since it is made using whitefish which isnt one of the usual customers when youre talking Fish Fry. Regardless, I knew it had to be done at some point and this Friday was it. The Friday special goes for $16.00 which is inline pricewise with everything else on their menu. One long, skinny piece of whitefish constitutes the portion and comes enrobed in a semi-dark beer batter. While it appeared as though it might be overly crispy and dry it actually had a really dynamic flavor that was smoky yet smooth. Despite its bulky appearance it was incredibly light. The fish was flaky and batter was deceptively airy and while whitefish isnt typically a Fish Fry fish, this stuff made the cut. It was very tasty. Many people in the upstairs dining room had the fish so I got a pretty good idea of what the roasted potatoes were going to be. Since Im a sucker for frites, and my better half wasnt in the mood for sharing the frites appetizer, I asked if they could be substituted to which the gracious waiter gladly obliged. It was a sage move on my part as the frites were nothing less than outstanding. They were light and crispy, but still soft and plush. I had to playfully slap the wifes hand away several times as she came for more after I gave her one to try.I think she is convinced that maybe a whole app wouldnt be a bad idea next time around. Keeping pace with the fish was a smooth and creamy tartar that made the fish better than it would have been alone. It was clearly homemade, and prepared such that it complemented the fish rather than overwhelming it. The slaw was also clearly made special for Friday and was fresh tasting. There was nothing funky or off-putting, and it just kind of did what it was supposed to do. Lastly, a basket of fresh rolls come before the entrees (whether they be fish or not) and are superb. They are little crusty loaves of love and clearly made with care. If all that wasnt enough the icing on the cake is that 1847 actually takes reservations on Friday nights! So if youre the type who doesnt like to wait and have a drink you can phone ahead and show up at a set time. If however, you are the social type, 1847 has not one, but two bars at which to get your fill of their spectacular craft cocktails, and believe me, these bartenders know their craft. I feel like Im gushing a bit, but this was just a great all around Fish Fry, and simply a great meal in general (of course it doesnt hurt that this was our Anniversary dinner and it went off without a hitch). Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and can hardly wait to come back for another round. 1847 is the place to be in 2015. Oh yeah, I almost forgot; the Fish Fry comes with a relish tray of sorts. Ours was mostly pickled peppers. Peter Piper would have been proud. www.1847stammhouse.com/6625 Century AvenueMiddleton, WI 53562     (608) 203-9430",3514,0.17995732838589984,0.4872659245516388

Hopcat doesnt even have a Fish Fry. I went for the beer. Hopcat has that. Boy, do they have that.Besides a bunch of beer Hopcat has Fish and Chips, but its not a Fish and Chips Id ever want to try again. This Fish and Chips floats along on the everyday menu and is really nothing special at all. The small basket runs a hefty $11.50 and is comprised of five small pieces of beer battered cod and a bunch of their signature Crack Fries. The portion is small (which is why I consider $11.50 hefty)  probably only five 5 ounces total. The best way to describe the fish is blah. The crumbly beer batter fall apart and doesnt cling to the poorly chosen cuts of fish at all. The meat is stringy rather than flaky which really leaves something to be desired. Where the fish fails the Crack Fries excel. Not only is the portion gigantic, but they are ultra-seasoned and truly unique. These spuds hang their hat on the seasoning blend, and its a good blend at that. While it seems to be mostly salt and pepper there is also something sweet in there  sweet chili or something like - that really makes them hit a different spot on the tongue. While I expected them to be thicker that wasnt necessarily a problem; the fact that they werent as crispy as they should have been was though. Still, they were very good and close to as good as advertised, but not quite. The tartar was forgettable, but necessary as it covered up the flawed fish with some necessary zip. There was no bread or slaw with the Fish and Chips which doesnt really leave much else to say. While it might not be fair to review this as a Fish Fry I have reviewed plenty of Fish and Chips that have made the grade so I think its justified. Overall, we dont recommend this fried fish, and while I actually liked the place much more than I thought I would, I wont be coming back for the fish any time soon. I would however gladly come back and take another romp through their extensive beer list as all three I tried were enjoyable and left me thinking there was plenty more to seeId also take another crack at those fries. hopcat.com/madison222 W.

Well, maybe not all the way back to their heyday back, but back for all intents and purposes they are. The Food Fight group has revamped the Avenue and have a Fish Fry focus the former owners can be proud of. Both the cod and the walleye have the same Spotted Cow beer batter and as you might expect it works better on the cod. The pieces of cod are relatively large and as flaky as you'd like. It pairs perfectly with the rich batter producing a near-perfect flavor. A decent amount of battered fries come buried beneath the fish and can almost be heard gasping for air from underneath the chunky fillets. Despite their lack of air, they remarkably retain a super-crunchy skin. Like the fish, they pair well with the Avenue's amazing homemade aioli-style tartar. This sublime sauce has some serious sweetness and a perfect consistency. I could probably just drink it like water and dip anything and everything in it...fish, fries, fingers, you name it. A small slab of dense rye on the side tugs at the heartstrings and lets you know the AC&BUB really cares about their Fish Fry in an old school kind of way. The slaw further proves that point as the homemade mix had a real punch that offset the stanky starch just right. There was a day the Avenue boasted the best Fish Fry in Madison, no ifs ands or buts about it. Those days have come and gone, but they Avenue of 2016 is doing all they can to reclaim that throne.

Its still good on the walleye and only slightly greasy which is a huge since the freshwater fish has a tendency to really hold the grease when a beer batter is applied. The Avenues fillet is a fat one which is probably a good 10 oz. or so. The meat is rich, but as expected, most of the flavor comes from the batter. This isnt necessarily a bad thing, since the batter is done right, but its still slightly atypical.

Food Fight has taken over the Avenue, and made lots and lots of changes. The place is different. It now features a modern, 50s-inspired look, and all the campy and nostalgic stuff from the old place is gonebye bye antique phone collection, bye bye old farming tools. This isnt your grandpas Avenue anymore, and hey, Im okay with that. Times change. Evolution CAN be a good thing if you allow it be.The new layout at the nue is actually more functional than the old one was, although it seems the number of actual tables has diminished. On our first trial, we showed up at 5:30 and were quoted a two hour wait. Since thats a nonstarter with a toddler we headed to Stalzys with the idea wed come back, reservation in hand, and we did just that the very next week. We got our spot just as they promised and everything was off to a good start. At 4:30 the place was pretty much dead  which was actually quite nice for a toddler  (also, toddler is a misleading term, our 22 month old does anything but toddle and he was tearassing all over that joint). Anyway, we got a nice big booth all to ourselves and had they eye of the waiter soon after. A round of drinks was ordered, but took a surprisingly long time to find its way to us. Im not sure what the holdup was at the bar, but the kitchen seems to have the same issue as the fish also took its sweet time. I wouldnt say it sat or anything (as it was hot and crispy when it arrived) it just seemed to be slowly prepared. The sushi quality cod was actually really good and quasi-justified the $15 price tag. It was home to a Spotted Cow beer batter that was lavishly seasoned. Often times seasonings get lost in a hearty batter, but the salt shown through and made its presence known. The fish itself was topnotch, and while the Food Fight cod is a glaring departure from the Zachs cod cubes of yore, the generous wings were plentiful and pleasant. Big win here. The fries were thick-cut crinkles and nothing to scoff at, but nothing to tell youd run to tell anyone about either. The portion was plentiful and they did their job, but in the end they best you can say is that they were good. Just good, and just enough. The Avenue of old doled out some of the thickest and creamiest tartar mankind has ever known, but the Food Fight form is a far different animal. It was still homemade, but thinner than most sauces you see. That said, it was surprisingly clingy and had a pop that brought out the full potential of the cod. A huge, crusty slice of caraway rye sat shotgun and was a real tour de force. Ive never actually seen this in Madison before and am really glad theyre taking a chance on it. While it was tough to bite through it was also easy to appreciate, and while the Fish Fry purists will likely love the gamble, I assume much of the rye will find its way back to kitchen untouched. I give them full credit. Lastly, there was some slaw. This vinegar version was homemade and fresh, but lacked the taste bud zapping power I anticipated. Like the Great Pumpkin, I kept expecting something to show up but eventually gave up hope. The slaw was there, but little else. I know there will be a public backlash to some extent, as the supper club feeling of the old Avenue is gone, but like I say, times change and you can either get busy living or get busy dying. Ill miss some of the old school charm as well, but I can take some solace in knowing this is easily the best Fish Fry Ive had at a Food Fight place (and Ive tried them all). Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry, and think it certainly doesnt compare to the original, but then again, what does? avenueclubmadison.com1128 E Washington AvenueMadison, WI 53703     (608) 257-6877",3779,0.22090311134831675,0.47438168376524537

This time is was the $13 3-piece cod again and it just didn't work for me. The batter was far too thick for my tastes, but it did have a pleasant flavor so there's that. Since Hollander is a ""beer place"" the beefy batter was clearly loaded up with suds, but the brand was obviously indiscernible. The fish itself was plentiful and seemed to be of decent quality, but the only thing that came through was the flavor of the batter since there was just so darn much of it. A nice portion of matchstick fries comes with the fish, but like it piscene counterpart, were kind of limp and uninspired. On the plus side they were slathered with plenty of salt which was enough to make them palatable in my eyes. The fish needed tartar like I needed another beer and the spongy coating soaked the sauce up with ease. Despite the fact it was thick and creamy it still couldn't go toe-to-toe with the brawny batter which is really a comment on how overbearing this batter really was. A forgettable slaw came along for the journey and while I remember very little about it every bite of it got eaten so I guess that is saying something. The highlight of it all (if there was one) was rye bread which (while seemingly unpopular) made me smile and added a hint of flavor that was otherwise lacking. Hollander has a great ambiance, impressive beer selection, and stellar location, but the Fish Fry somehow keeps regressing. We initially found it chic and extraordinarily kid friendly, so maybe we were blinded somewhat, but whatever the case our last couple trips have not been great. Overall, we don't recommend this Fish Fry no matter how much we'd like to. cafehollander.com/hilldale/726 N Midvale BoulevardMadison, WI 53705     (608_ 237-3168",1890,0.154229797979798,0.5448653198653198

Pretty much everyone wants em and will do whatever they can to get em. Café Hollander was the shiny new toy in Hilldale for a good four months or so and everyone wanted to be there and do that. They didnt care how long they had to wait for a table or how expensive the beers were. It was a golden age for the Lowlands group.  As so often happens, shiny things start to fade and the true nature of the object is revealed. At this point its the genuine articles that start to shine and in the case of a restaurant the article is the food. No matter how cool the atmosphere or how expansive the beer section a restaurant must have good food if they want to survive. Hollander is toeing a thin line. The Firday special at Hollander is a 3-piece cod affair and comes beer battered or extra crispy (potato chip crusted). Our previous experience led us towards the beer batter and the fried morsels looked amazing perched on Hollanders patio under the golden sun. The cod was very basic but also hearty. The three meaty pieces were paired with a beefy batter that didnt have much favor, but covered a few minor imperfections on the flaky fishs belly. While we prefer thinner batters the cuts were big enough that the substantial sheath didnt take over completely. When compared to the plentiful portion of cod the serving of French fries was miniscule. The 20 or so shoestrings that made the trip were perfectly fried and tasty, but such a small sampling still left a bad taste in my mouth. Hollanders tartar was homemade and pungent, but not necessarily in a good way. It was overloaded with capers and bogged down by too much relish. While I still used some of it, much of the cod was eaten dry which doesnt say much for the sauce. A nice little crusty bun with salt sprinkled on top was the next order of business and this delectable number was much better than a basic roll. The slaw was also better than basic, but not a lot. It appeared to be made in-house and had a good flavor but nothing otherworldly. Well take it for what it is  not Sysco, but not much beyond either. We loved the shiny new Fish Fry at Hollander the first couple times we tried it, but some of the luster was missing this time around. The fish wasnt as sumptuous, the fries were scarce, the tartar missed the mark, and while the supporting cast was good, it wasnt enough to take things over the top. Overall, we dont recommend the Fish Fry we had this time around, but will likely give them yet another shot to prove the spark isnt totally gone. Why you ask? 1) The beer selection is impressive and Ive liked all of them Ive tried. 2) They have good vegetarian options (or at least have them, I have no idea how good they actually are). And 3) They are more kid-friendly than most bars or supper clubs.

Plain old beer batter is the other option and is actually a little superior in our opinion. The batter is decadent, but not over the top, and has a really great flavor with very little if any grease. The fish also remains much more flaky and moist with a pliability that was simply more enticing than the rigidity of the crispy kind. Overall, they were both recommendable but we found the beer batter to be more balanced. Any good fish is complemented by homemade fries (or frites in this case), and the Belgian-inspired tubers were super salty and extremely well executed. These were the kind of frites that always make us wonder, why cant every place just do it like this? and while we know not every place can, we certainly wish every place would. They were tender little sticks of love. Hollanders tartar is clearly made in-house but somehow missed the mark.

Its probably the only weak spot of the meal, but isnt even close to a deal-breaker. Since Hollander is a Milwaukee-based micro-franchise they stick with the traditional rye on the side. The lightly-toasted pumpernickel is good, but doesnt have the expected bite. Still, its a step up from a basic dinner roll, and huge leap from nothing at all (which is all too common in 2015). The house-made slaw comes in a little bucket-looking thing and while our cups didnt overfloweth, it was still plentiful enough to get the job done. We got a good bead on it, and thought the light, vinegar-based mix, was fresh and crisp. The toasted sesame and cilantro made it very diverse, and while it wasnt the best weve had, it was far from the worst. Quite commendable.

While our first visit wasnt all bad, a few things fell flat which left a bad taste in our mouths (pun only partially intended). We knew we had to come back, and the opening day of the Mad City Pond Hockey Championship turned out to be our chance.Previously we tried the cod, and while we liked it a lot the service was off which painted everything in a strange light. Luckily, the fish didnt suffer much which gave us a glimpse into all that Maxs had to offer. This time around we picked the $15 perch and everything seemed to go much smoother. Like the cod, the perch has a dark brown breading that is extra crispy. The crunch is satisfying, but as the breading doesnt have a ton of seasoning the flavors of the perch what remains. While that is a good thing to some extent, perch is mild and always benefits from a bump (usually in the form of salt). Regardless, the five fillets were quite tasty and went quite fast. Some truly excellent homemade tartar had plenty of pop, and paired really nicely with the perch. It created a dichotomy of delectability against the fishs crispy coating, which might be exactly what they were going for when they kept the breading demure. House-cut fries are always preferable and Maxs minions are thick and hearty. This bunch was fried to a point of supple attraction without being soggy. These are some truly top-notch spuds, and if you cant finish the generous portion feel free to pass the rest my way, Ill gladly gobble them up. Maxs slaw is some of the craziest out there, but that isnt necessarily the worst thing. The fruity fusion is loaded with dried cranberries and apple slices. Its clearly made with thought and while I dont love it I bet there are many out there that would. Its odd, but all that sweetness doesnt make it unappealing. A little glistening bun glowed under the lights and was a welcome departure from the prepackaged yeast roll. It was fresh and warm and just makes you feel good. Kudos to Max on this one.  Kinks cane be hard to work out, but it looks like Middletons newcomer is finding a serious groove. Everything this time around ran much smoother and everyone in our crew was happy (even our resident vegetarian who got a hearty salad this time around). Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and think it fits well on the Middleton landscape.

Is it a compulsion? Maybe. Is it an obsession? Probably. Do I really care? Hell no. I heard about the Fish Fry at Maxs Farm Table and the very next week swung by to check it out. It had to be done, and Im glad I did it.For starters this experience was far from perfect. The service was off, the fish wasnt cheap, and the veggies sandwich my wife got was laughable; but despite all that this Fish Fry made the grade. Maxs has cod ($14) and lake perch ($15) specials on Fridays and on this maiden voyage I decided to stick with the standard cod. We took a corner booth, ordered at the counter, and got our number. Apparently this was the first week of counter service as the normal table service wasnt working well for them, but even this upgrade was still wonky. No one really seemed to know what their job was, beer had to be retrieved from the upstairs bar, and things were just kind of slow in general. It was an odd introduction, but thankfully none of it caused the fish to suffer. The cod didnt sit too long before it came our way, but it wasnt steaming hot when it arrived. The flaky fish was highlighted by a light and crispy breading with a pleasant seasoning. The crunchy coating had a dark color, but that didnt mean it was burned. Maybe they use wheat flour? I dont know. But I do know it was tasty and grease-free. The three pieces were quite large, although Im sure some would still gripe over the $14 price tag. While I do think its a tad high all prices are trending this way so Max might just be a bit ahead of the times. Dividing the plate in half was a heaping handful of house-cut fries. The thick-cut spuds were right on the money and perfectly fried (which is difficult to achieve with house-cuts). They complemented the fish well but not as nicely as the house tartar did. This brew was thick and creamy, but ran out way before the big portion of fish did. While I would gladly have taken more of the splendid sauce I didnt even consider asking for it since would have required a trip to the counter and god knows how long it would have taken as there was a long line forming. A warm, glistening, white bun and a dollop of butter filled the bottom corner of the plate and was not your run of the mill dough. It was light and fluffy and a huge step up from a basic yeast roll. The house-made apple slaw was also head and shoulders above the Sysco standard and as diverse as they come. While fruity slaws usually misses me, this was charmingly bizarre. My vegetarian wife enjoyed it quite a bit and ate nearly all of it as her side-less sandwich was nowhere near a full meal. For $8 she received a roll dotted with a few sautéed peppers, and onions, and slice of provolone, that was it. It was puny, no sides come with it and it was basically a rip off, theres no other way to say it. All in all this Fish Fry was good, although on the high end for a 3-piece cod. Every element was above average and despite the shortcomings in service the Fry delivered the goods. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and while were not champing at the bit to come back well no doubt give them a chance at full redemption one of these days. Hopefully, theyll have their feet all the way under them by then.  www.maxsfarmtable.com/2831 Parmenter StreetMiddleton, WI 53562     (608) 824-0114",3395,0.16390151515151513,0.5151076050685425

Along those same lines, when in Milwaukee eat a Fish Fry. Its essentially the same thing, so just do it.I was at a conference at the Hilton downtown and since driving somewhere wasnt an option I decided to just hit up the lobby bar. I was down there the night before and it seemed like a pretty nice spot so I figured the Fish Fry (which appears on the everyday menu, but costs and extra two bucks on Friday) was worth a shot. I pulled up, started munching on a cone of the free house-made chips, and had a long neck of High Life in front of me in lickety-split. The bartender was a friendly chap and had my 3-piece cod on the bar in seemingly no time. Of course, the time flew by as I munched the marvelous chips so it may well have been 10 minutes or more, I really have no idea. The fish featured a Miller beer batter which was every bit of basic. The coating was uninspired but didnt leave too big of a greasy smear, so theres that. In addition, a couple bites of the fish were a little chewy but others we smooth and flaky so it was a definitely a mixed bag. Overall it was fine, but thats about it. Luckily for the flawed fish, the tartar sauce was superb. It was incredibly thick and creamy with all sorts of good stuff mixed in. It covered nearly all the imperfections in the cod and is literally some of the best I can remember eating recently. When stacked alongside the sauces that accompanied the hors douevres at the conference its clear that the Hilton has a whale of a sous-chef in that kitchen as every single one of them was electric. Speaking of singular, one, count it  one, potato pancake was positioned in the center of the long rectangular plate. It was eerily reminiscent of a Japanese flag and had me wondering if the sun would ever rise on this Fish Fry. In essence it did shine somewhat as the kinda thick cake had a legit crust and plenty of flavor. The best part was the seasoning which was so diverse there is no way you parse it out. While there was no onion-y overtone they were robust and thats what really matters. Milwaukee is the rye capital of Wisconsin so its surprising that none came with the Miller Time Fish Fry. It was unexpected and undesirable. The sweet and creamy slaw made up for it somewhat with loads of carrot and a bunch of other goodies in there. While this Fish Fry wasnt all bad there is no way that I would come back for it next time Im in Milwaukee on a Friday. Overall, we dont recommend this Fish Fry, and we know brew town has much more to offer elsewhere. millertimepub.com509 W Wisconsin AvenueMilwaukee, WI 53203     (414) 271-2337",2662,0.1451060744810745,0.41589438339438345

The venerable establishment always seemed to have its share of loyal locals, but for whatever reason the few regulars couldnt keep the ship afloat. It was a slow burn, but eventually the bar was razed (metaphorically speaking) leaving a smoldering sadness in its wake. Like a phoenix, the Badger Tavern has risen from those ashes and with it comes a fresh coat of paint and a fresh outlook on the Friday Fish Fry.Tony Franks hung their hat on their famous bar burgers, but their Fish Fry was far from noteworthy. Pre-battered cod and a side of freezer fries certainly didnt draw much fanfare, and with good reason  it was truly terrible. The Badger is taking things much more seriously than Tony ever did with a legitimate Friday special that runs all day long. Its a straightforward affair - $11 for a 2-piece cod or $13 for a 3-piece, along with standard sides. Just pulling into the parking lot is enough to get your motor running as the aroma of the deep fryer permeates the atmosphere and draws you inside on a cloud of oil-soaked oxygen. Once inside the bar its clear that some thought went into the remodel. While it may have lost some of the character the made Toby Franks Tony Franks, its now a well-lit and a very welcoming modern neighborhood bar. It also seems slightly more spacious, which is a big plus since it was plenty busy this Friday afternoon. Our waitress was super friendly and quite attentive considering how many groups were under her watchful eye. Our baskets of fish came fast and were nice and hot, just how youd want them to be. The cod had a golden hue and was just slightly better than average in our opinion. The tender loins were home to a light and flaky batter that paired well with the flaky cuts of fish. While moderate amounts of greased seeped from the bottom corners it didnt destroy the batter as long as the pieces were turned every so often  so be sure to do that or it could get soppy on you. A bevy of long, shoestring style fries played Cheech to the fishs Chong and were just as well-fried. There was nothing unique about them except for their length which pointed to a distributor that acquires elongated spuds. Stretched Sysco? Rangy Reinhart? Who know? Who cares? Looooooong fries were in abundance.A thick and relish-y tartar marginalized the grease almost entirely and while it could very well have just been Sysco, I wouldnt like it any less if it was. It did what it needed to do. Some finely-chopped slaw with a little something unique played its roll with a dry humor. It was just fine but could have used some more creaminess to pull it all together. The Fry could also have used some more bread since none came with the Fish Fry. Ugh. Tony Franks was a great bar, but their Fish Fry was downright pathetic. The Badger Tavern is moving things forward but there are definitely still improvements that could be made. Less grease, and a slice of rye would certainly put the Badger Tavern in the every week discussion. As it stands were satisfied knowing what its all about and will probably just come back when we happen to be in the area. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and are glad to see new life in old Tony Franks 1612 Seminole HighwayMadison, WI 53711     (608) 286-1450",3331,0.13428474510564065,0.5062097521052745

Of course, I knew it probably wasnt going to be all that great, but then again, I really didnt care. When a supper club themed concession stands opens up in the Kohl Center and offers a Fish Fry special on Friday Im going to be the one to take the bullet. I really wouldnt have it any other way. Luckily, I know a guy so the tickets to the game were comped which made this brutal Fry a little easier to swallow. $9.75 wont get you much in the way of Fish Fry regardless of where you go and since its the Kohl Center, where prices are high to begin with, it was definitely a bad omen. As you can probably guess, the fish is cod and it isnt hand-battered. The freezer fresh fillets are small, and barely a step up from Mrs. Pauls famous sticks. It was every bit of below average with its chewy texture and thick batter. It basically had no redeeming qualities except for the fact it was available at the Kohl Center. The waffle fries that come with were the highlight of the meal, but even they were pretty lowly. They had a massive amount of salt applied which made them pungent, but also pretty offensive. The tartar was just three packets of Tartar Sauce with nary a brand name even. Of course, no bread came along which really didnt matter much anyway. As if that wasnt enough the coleslaw was ultra-funky and almost tasted rancid. While I wouldnt quite go that far (as I didnt get sick or anything) it was some of the worst Ive seen. While I anticipated it wouldnt be great I dont think anything could have prepared me for how bad this Fish Fry really was. It doesnt even approach something worthy of calling itself supper club fare which is a shame because the stand itself looks pretty cool in comparison to what you normally see. Overall, we dont recommend this Fish Fry and suggest you just get your fish fix before the big game at the Big 10 or one of the other campus area establishments. Sorry, Travel Wisconsin, but it had to be said.  http://www.uwbadgers.com/sports/2015/08/21/GEN_2014010135.aspx601 W.

Ive known about it forever, heard it was decent, but for whatever reason never popped in for it. Even Im not sure why I never made the leap, but I just didnt. After looking at my Fish Finder a couple weeks ago I noticed it was still there, and near my office, so I finally did what needed to be done.The lunch special at B-A-V is a 6-piece cod nugget affair and comes with all the basic FF sides. After 4pm a 2-piece with normal sized pieces is available along with walleye and some other oddballs like fish tacos. Our lunch plate took a little longer than expected to fry and wasnt smoldering hot like we like it. The fish was ok, but as so often happens with small pieces it lost its flakiness. I had to rip and gnaw at it which is never a good thing. The cod was home to a very light and clingy breading that was unfortunately devoid of favor. While these nuggets werent great there is a lot of potential here as we also sampled the 1-piece senior/kids meal which features full-sized pieces and it was much moister and flakier. I guess next time well just come back after 4:00. The galley fries that come with the nuggets were fine but some were thin and some thick which led to uneven frying. The normal fries that come with the kids fish are Sysco crinkles so the alternative wasnt much better. The tartar was also basic Sysco and while fine, had a funny aftertaste. Perhaps it was on the verge of spoilage but regardless Sysco sauce usually does what it needs to do. A football-shaped roll was nicely warmed and paired well with the surprisingly good slaw. While Id guess it was also just Sysco I ate both mine and the kids so there is something there to like. The Vard is a surprisingly nice bowling alley and the dining area is actually very attractive. Its spacious, has free popcorn and plenty of pool tables. While the lunch Fry missed the mark I think dinner may be much better. Overall, we dont recommend this Fish Fry, but will likely come back some day after 4:00 and see whats what. www.bowlavard.com2121 East Springs DriveMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-7246",2120,0.15767421602787454,0.5448044909020519

The fish is trout and trout is not your typical Fish Frying fish. Of course, you can fry trout, but then again you can fry anything Snickers, Twinkies you name it. Still, Frieburg calls their Friday special a Fish Fry and for what its worth it isnt all bad.The trout schnitzel runs a hefty $16 and is focused around one huge piece of trout. The fancy fillet comes full skin-on with a light breading thats crunchy and delectable. For starters, the fish was fine, but trout is clearly not meant to be a frying fish. It got a little mushy and didnt keep a ton of the inherent flavors, but was at least plentiful. Luckily, the coating was perfectly crispy and balanced the lackluster texture out as best it could. Two nice potato pancakes sit shotgun and are well-shredded but lack seasoning. While the texture and consistency are spot on, the onion-y undertones are sorely lacking. Regardless, the homemade cakes still disappeared from our plates quickly and made for a welcome change of pace from the basic crinkle-cut fries. Such a massive slab of fish needs plenty of tartar and we had to ask for a backup. The homemade mix picked the fish up a tad with its thick, chunky texture and plenty of pep. The last piece of the plate was the slaw which looked raw and nasty, but was surprisingly supple and tasty. It had a nice vinegar base and a great balance which really threw us for a loop. It was simply great, no doubt about it. Before anything else comes, Freiburg provides a bountiful basket of bread and a couple different kinds of mustard. The pretzel rolls were particularly enticing and the dense white only further added to the abundance. In addition, the mustards really made them pop. I know, mustard on bread seems weird, and maybe its just a German thing, but they totally worked. The hot one featured a nice horseradish punch while the other was smoother but still had plenty of flavoreven on bread. Not every Fish Fry is traditional, but that doesnt mean theyre not worth eating. The Freiburg Fry is a tough one though since its so unique. The trout was alright, but in the end just isnt meant for frying. Luckily, the sides were all pretty stellar and brought everything up a notch. Overall, we barely recommend this Fish Fry based on the respectable sides and adequate fish. Despite the trout being atypical I think there are a lot of people out there that will like what Freiburg has to offer and we may well come back on a Friday again.  www.freiburgmadison.com2612 Monroe StreetMadison, WI 53711     (608) 204-2755",2672,0.14439628857732303,0.5637867879247189

In actuality, I was kind of surprised that they even have a Friday Fish Fry since its kind of an old fogy thing, but here we are, at the Blind. Lets start with the (very) good.The 7th floor bar is as cool as they come  subway tile, plaid bathroom (not kidding), amazing views, you name it, The Blinds got it. We showed up early (early enough for the sunset special in fact  if you need to know what this is just show up a few minutes before sunset some day), and had no problem procuring a spot in the surprisingly spacious dining room. We kicked it, and had a couple plates of the $13 3-piece cod in due time. The first thing you will notice is that the pieces of fish here are absolutely massive. Youre easily looking at a good 4-5 oz. each which adds up to damn near a pound of fish. Each is moist and flaky, and surprisingly grease-free. I say surprisingly due to the moderately-thick beer batter that enrobes it. This sheath doesnt get soggy and has a remarkable flavor. While I love a hearty portion this was so much fish it is almost too much to handle  dont let the pictures on Facebook fool you. Duck fat fries are all the rage these days and The Blind is hip to the scene. These babies are superb as the thick, skin-on cuts are fried just right. Duck fat gives the spuds a truly unique flavor that really keeps you coming back for more (and believe me, I did). Their tartar is also excellent with a subtle sweetness and perfect consistency. One cup was far from enough for the bevy of fish so look to add a second if youre planning to pound the pound. The Blind doesnt bring the bread and theres also no slaw so this is really more of a fish-n-chips affair than the traditional Wisconsin fish fry. Still, it is recommendable due to the quality of what you do get. Theres no doubt Id come back in a heartbeat if that was the end of it, but unfortunately thats not the case. While the atmosphere was great, the drinks were tasty, and the food was excellent, everyone (and I mean everyone) in our party of four got sick to varying degrees afterwards. While I obviously cant say that is was the food that did it, mine personally didnt make it through digestion and Ill leave it at that. It was a rough way to end what was such a pleasurable experience to say the least. Overall, we still recommend this Fish Fry and feel compelled to come back, if for no other reason that we want to reassure ourselves how great the food really is and our sickness was just a strange coincidence. graduatemadison.com601 Langdon StreetMadison, WI 53703     (608) 257-4391",2647,0.17546082949308758,0.5356470814132105

Everything about this one is well-executed, from the lightly breaded fillets to the perfectly portioned sides; it shows how remarkable a Fish Fry can be when all the elements comes together in just the right way. Anytime we're in the area (which is rarely, unfortunately) we take 15 minute detour north on 45 to the western shore of the Lake Winnebago. It's so worth it.There are other fish to choose from at Wendt's (like the HUGE Haddock), but their calling card is definitely the perch. The perch plates come in a few different sizes and we stuck with the regular portion, which is made up of three butterflies (or six fillets). These beauties take center stage and are a picture of perfection with their dense and flaky meat. Wendt's has been frying these perch for decades so they know the exact duration to dunk them for so they come out golden brown and without a hint of grease. Each is smooth and slightly sweet with a light breading that really lets the fish shine through. While I personally would like to see a hint more seasoning in crumbly coating, that's an incredibly minor quibble. This is truly the good stuff. As a supper club style establishment Wendt's brings several side options to the table, but we went for the cross-cuts (waffle) fries this time around and it turned out the be a sage decision. These babies are well-seasoned, perfectly crispy, and came in a plentiful portion. The tartar is thinner than you might expect so it's not exactly a supper club style zinger, but the sauce (served in a big squeeze bottle) has a superb flavor. Like the perch it's smooth and mild and takes things to another level. Some absolutely amazing vinegar-based coleslaw is incredibly zippy without being sour. It has a clean and fresh taste, and is likely be some of the tastiest slaw out there (and easily some of the best we can ever remember eating). Two big old slabs of white bread are pre-buttered and slapped face-2-face, but the only part of this Fry that aren't above average...but hey, at least they're there. It's hard to say what the perfect Fish Fry is because that means a little something different to everyone, but the lake perch at Wendt's might be as close as you will ever come to a consensus. This is really excellent fish that we'll seek out any time we are over on the east side of the state on a Friday. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry, and think it's probably one of the best you'll ever find. wendtsonthelake.comN9699 Lake Shore RoadVan Dyne, WI 54979     (920) 688-5231",2681,0.25555335097001763,0.4931043956043956

If, on the other hand, you are looking for great Fish Fry the world over read on, my friend. Wendts on the Lake is obviously not close to Madison, but believe me when I tell you, its a great oneand the world already knows all about it. I happened to be in the area on a Friday and had heard so many amazing things about Wendts perch I resolved to get there no matter what. Theres no doubt that Wendts is the place to be any old Friday, but today it was magnified by the start of sturgeon spearing season on Lake Winnebago. The place was buzzing, the entire parking lot was full, and a bus full of senior citizens was unloading to make things even more hectic. Ice shanties dotted the ice, stretching as far as the eye could see in all directions. And, not to be outdone, the Wisconsin Foodie was even there filming a segment for the show. It was madness, but I somehow managed to snag a stool at the bar without issue, which was a small miracle unto itself. As soon as I could get a bartenders attention I ordered my food (which was a difficult choice to say the least). Wendts fancies themselves the lake perch specialists, and as such have a few sizes to choose from - starting with a single order of three butterflies ($14) and topping out with the triple order ($25). Apparently this system has been instituted since my visit as my order was the regular (10 ouncer) which was made up of 5 butterflies for $17. I have no idea why the change was put in place, all I know is my portion was hearty and came alarmingly fast considering the number of orders pouring into the kitchen. The perch was nothing less than magnificent. It was light and flaky and the 10 full fillets filled out the plate. The succulent swimmers were home to Wendts classic breading, which claims to have been in use for nigh on to 80- years. While the coating wasnt super seasoned it had the perfect consistency. It was light and crumbly which complemented the pristine perch underneath just right. While Id like to see the salt quotient dialed up a notch, I also like the fact that they let the perch speak for itself and this stuff can definitely orate. Wendts homemade tartar comes in a big squeeze bottle and I went back for multiple squirts. It was clingy, but not overly thick, which only served to enhance the delicate perch. The relish was finely chopped which kept the nozzle clog-free, and the pop was there, but like the breading didnt usurp any of the perchs inherent majesty. Lots of potato options are available although none are cut in-house. I debated between the cross-cuts (waffle fries), regular fries, and steak fries, eventually settling on the ccs. The spud lattices were very good, and came dashed with season salt. While the tasty tubers arent quite on the same level as Dexters they arent far behind either. Maintaining the theme of excellence was Wendts slaw which was nothing short of wonderful. Purple cabbage and a few carrot shards were swimming in a pool of sweet and zesty vinegar that was perfectly balanced by a shot of sugar. Im not even kidding when I say its some of the best Ive had, and as you know, Ive had my share. A fat slice of French bread comes pre-buttered, split down the middle, and laid face-to-face. While it was nicer than what most place serve with their fish it was clearly the lowlight or what is a show stopping Fish Fry. All I can say is wow. This Fish Fry had it all and was nothing short of amazing from tip to tail. Wendts was vibrant, it was busting, it was the essence of what a Fish Fry is all about. In addition, more merchandise flew out in the half hour I was there than most places probably do in an entire year. Hats, tees, sweatshirts, all were fair game. People clearly love this place and it shows.

They have a really good Fish Fry and it only costs ten bucks. Yeah, $10thats like one mocha-frappa-choco-barfo-latte at Starbucks. You cant beat that price, and when you consider youre downtown it only sweetens the deal.It goes without saying that the Citys digs arent the most attractive  it is a basement after all, and making yourself descend the staircase a on beautiful Friday afternoon would be damn near impossible if not for the lure of freshly fried fish. Unfortunately for us, our fish, while freshly fried, was not up to snuff this Friday. It was super greasy and leaked onto everything in its path. The fries were soaked. The tartar and slaw were swimming. And the ryethe rye was fortuitously spared due to the high ground on which it sat. You see, we were literally the first diners of the day and I presume the fryer hadnt been started before our arrival. When fish is fried in lukewarm oil it tends to harbor grease which leaks out during the course of the meal and that is exactly what happened here. Fortunately, the breading was still flavorful (although it couldnt cling as it normally does), and salvaged the slick cod to some extent. The fries, save for those on the bottom, were still plentiful, crispy, and well-seasoned which buoyed the Fry to some extent. The cups of slaw and tartar, while lubed up, had contents intact. The diced, creamy slaw had the welcomed zip we expected, and the tartar packed the punch the cod craved. The rye was pristine as it sat perched atop Fry Mountain, and added an aridity that was sorely needed. This is our first less than stellar Fish Fry at the City and while the greasiness was a big problem its partially our fault for arriving so damn earlyunfortunately that is how were forced to roll these days. Overall, we still recommend this Fish Fry as the price is just too good not to. Rest assured well be back in due time and Im sure the next round will be everything we expect it to be if not more. citybarmadison.com636 State StreetMadison, WI 53703     (608) 250-2489",2112,0.09756756756756757,0.4892942942942942

Ive had plenty of food at the City in the past but they just started doing a Fish Fry a couple months ago and its already firing on all cylinders. Their only option is a $10 3-piece cod, but it comes with all the fixins. For starters, the fish is superb. And I do mean SUPERB.

It pairs perfectly with the cod and although the fish probably doesnt need it, it definitely welcomes it with open arms. Over the course of two visits we sampled two different styles of coleslaw  the first being a finely-chopped creamy rendition that had all pop you want and no odd flavors beyond that. The second was more of a vinegar base that was clearly made fresh for the day. Of the two, the vinegar variety was superior and I hope they stick with it moving forward.

That is, you would have been right until a couple month ago when they suddenly started a Fish Fry on Fridays. Of course, the moment I heard about it I had to have it and took the first available opportunity to do so.Arriving at 11am made us the first customers of the day and although the Fish Fry wasnt listed anywhere on the menu the big mixing bowls on the counter were a dead giveaway that it was indeed available. The Frites Fry is a 2-piece cod affair and goes for $12 (additional pieces are available for two bucks a pop). MCF is a small place and the pieces of fish seemingly take a cue from their surroundings. The two tiny cuts of cod looked tasty and were flaky, but little else. They housed a breading that was light to the touch but also light on seasoning. By and large it wasnt noteworthy, but has plenty of room to grow. A place that specializes in frites had better know their way around spuds and these were as advertised. They were thick (at least 10mm according to their thorough definition), crispy on the outside, and fluffy on the inside. Of course, they were double-fried (as all frites are) and well-seasoned (as the fish was not). Obviously a Fish Fry is supposed to come with tartar sauce, and maybe it was because I asked for the Mad Sauce with my frites, but no tartar came with the fish. MCF is big on the sauces (its kind of their shtick), and this stuff was spicy and delicious, but much better with the fries than the fish as you might expect. No bread or slaw came with the $12 Fish Fry so it was a very bare bones affair and really left me wanting more. Mad City Frites is a great little spot and their specialty spuds are delectable, but the Friday special is a little rough around the edges. Small portions, no bread, and no slaw really dont add up to $12 worth of food. Overall, we dont recommend this Fish Fry but see a lot of potential in those fryers. www.madcityfrites.com320 State StreetMadison, WI 53703     (608) 204-6150",2077,0.11978084415584415,0.4873430735930736

Its no secret that people in rural communities expect a little more for their money and nowhere is that exemplified more so than at Borgens Café in Westby, WI.Borgens has been filling folks up for decades and their $12 3-piece cod did the trick for metheres also 1-piece and 2-piece versions available, but those are more for the senior set, Id say. All the fish include a romp through Borgens salad bar which is chock-full of mixed greens, potato salad, cottage cheese, coleslaw, cheese spread, clam chowder, and much morejust like your favorite supper club. The benevolent bar is at least a $4 value and I took full advantage, as most folks would. A fresh baked roll awaited my arrival upon returning from the salad bar and was soft and crusty. It was as delectable as they come and proved once again that small towners fear no gluten. The fish arrived before I even exhausted the salad and looked picture perfect. Three hefty pieces of cod were home to a typical beer batter that is undoubtedly a people pleaser. While it was good clean fish there was nothing special about it and I for one would love some more seasoning. In all likelihood the older crowd they draw prefers their fish a bit blander so I can see why it is the way it is. Borgens is basically a diner and as such youd expect the hash browns to be aces and these are. While the cheese and onion will cost ya a buck extra they are well worth the upcharge so be sure to pull that trigger. These shreds were perfectly fried starting with crispy edges and finishing with a sheen of grease under their supple belly. Big beer batters necessitate thick and creamy tartar and Borgens delivers the goods although it was a bit heavy on the relish. As someone who grew up in a small town I appreciate what Borgens offers  bang for your buck and lots of it. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and think if you happen to be tooling around the Driftless Area some Friday you shouldnt hesitate to stop at Borgens.

From Superior to Milwaukee and everywhere in between, when the clock strikes 11:00, battered fish meets boiling oil. I happened to be just north of Madison this Friday and figured Id roll the dice on the Lucky 13 Saloon since Id heard their Fish Fry was worth a shot.The Lucky 13 is located at the junction of Highways 13 and 82, east of Mauston and north of the Dells. Like any good tavern, their Fry starts at 11:00 on Fridays, and this one features cod served three ways  breaded, beer battered, or broiled. It costs a scant $9.50 and Bev the bartender had my breaded bunch ready in no time. Since it was cod theres not much to say about the actual fish save for the fact it was flaky. The hand breading on the other hand can be dissected, although there wasnt all that much to piece out there either. It was light to the touch, but also light on flavor. It held the cod together well, but in all honesty, didnt do much to improve it. It was just a solid, inoffensive rendition but considering how much seasoning the fries had I could only wish some would have spilled over onto the fish. While Im on the subject lets talk about the fries. These beauties were a battered brand and extremely well-seasoned. The seasoning danced on the palate and offset the crunch of the steak-style cuts superbly. If only the fish had gotten some of that love. If onlyA 2 oz. cup of tartar was holdup next to the fish and was moderately zippy, but also a little rank tasting. If I had to wager a guess Id say it was standard issue Sysco which is creamy, but oftentimes has an odd aftertaste. Half a slice of thick white bread and some horseradish slaw finish things off and do so admirably. While neither are head and shoulders above their contemporaries they both do what they need to do with no letdowns. Once in a while an amazing Fish Fry shows up in the most unexpected of places and while the Lucky 13 didnt reach those heights it is a nice straight-forward take on the classic and if I was in the area I wouldnt hesitate to stop in again. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and thats that. www.facebook.com/Lucky13SaloonWI/1400 WI-82 TrunkWisconsin Dells, WI 53965     (608) 678-7272",2263,0.12182017543859654,0.4991228070175438

Since I knew all the fish come beer battered (save for the pan-seared walleye) I stuck with the $14 cod although bluegill and lake perch always tug at my heartstrings a little. As expected this cod is really good. While there are only two pieces to the portion they are chunkers. The thick, juicy loins play nicely with the beer batter which itself is surprisingly light and crumbly. In all honesty, pieces of the batter actually fell off in parts, and the fish a slightly slick at times, but overall it played the part well and I absolutely destroyed them despite talking shop the whole time. Any place that is willing to do the work and make house-cut fries instead of the alternative is going to receive high praise from me and OBD answers the call. These frites are right on the money, double fried and double delicious. They are some of the better fries you'll find in town, and very much like you'd find in Belgium, only more democratic. Off Broadway goes off-script with a homemade tartar and the cod soaked up the thick and zippy emulsion with ease. In actuality, some of the falling apart of the fish I mentioned earlier can be attributed to the clingy sauce which at times pulled the loosely adhered batter right off...like the Kraken taking down a ship many a cod flake was lost to an ooey, gooey, and oh so delicious, saucy grave. mmmm mmmm mmmm Like most everything else associated with this Fry the slaw was homemade and creamy.

Of course, Madison is a modern city and the modern restaurant design philosophy of exposed brick, reclaimed barn wood, and Edison bulbs has taken center stage. While these places definitely have the look, and don't necessarily lack character, they are becoming more and more cookie-cutter in nature. The Off Broadway Draft House is one of these new wave of restaurants, but contrary to their modern design philosophy they maintain a classic Wisconsin Fish Fry, so they're A-OK with me.OBDH has a few different fish available on Friday (cod, lake perch, and bluegill) all of which share the same beer batter. The cod is a 2-piece affair and runs $14 whether you come in for lunch or dinner. On previous visits we've sampled the perch and the bluegill, both of which are good, but mostly lost to the bountiful batter. Today was the day for the cod, and since beer batter is generally best applied to saltwater fish the cod at Off Broadway only served to reinforce this axiom. The batter (as expected) was on the thick side and had a little grease in it's midst. It complemented the cod as well as can be expected but was very middle of the road overall. While I can't really complain about the fish as a whole, I can't say a ton of great things about it either. Sure, there is nothing glaringly wrong and it's definitely worth getting, but it's not really inspiring. Just solid cod. Where the cod left off the house-cut fries picked up and took everything to another level. These puppies were outstanding, and while I would have liked a bigger portion, what was there was adequate (for most people) and fried to perfection. The house-made tartar also did the job and covered any of the minor imperfections in the cod. It was a thick and creamy blend with plenty of pop. A cube of cornbread with a big old schmere of butter pre-applied to it sat alongside and didn't scream ""Fish Fry side!"" but I still enjoyed it, as well as the big old ramekin of slaw. This cup of creamy goodness was en point and got crushed straight away. Like the other elements it was likely made in house and a definite people pleaser. While I'm not one to stand in the way of progress I will always be in favor of traditional establishments. Luckily for us Madisonites, the places popping up might have a modern flair but are keeping the tradition of the Fish Fry alive. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and think the Off Broadway Draft House is a shining example of how modern and traditional can work together. offbroadwaydrafthouse.com/5404 Raywood RoadMadison, WI 53713     (608) 630-9111",2715,0.14515392015392012,0.43547779381112717

You know the kind of place - lots of wood and brick, farm-to-table style menu, and a laundry list of beers (most of which are from places you've never heard of). While it all seems like a bit of a fad to me, many of these places also appear to have staying power since the food is usually above average and the atmosphere inviting. That's exactly the case at the Off Broadway Draft House.We landed on Off Broadway a few months ago when they just had cod and lake perch and we thought there was a lot of promise. Since then they've added walleye and bluegill to the Friday menu and are serving them all day long. The cod, lake perch, and bluegill all run $14, while the walleye sits at $17, beer batter being the tie that binds. Now, beer batter and bluegill rarely mix since beefy batters tend to overwhelm the delicate fillets, but I figured I'd roll the dice since I'd heard good things about it. As expected, while the fish offerings have changed, the coating hasn't and the subtle flavor of the fish was mostly masked by the overbearing batter. A bit of the bluegill essence did come through here and there, but by and large the batter took center stage. It was still good but the overall taste was about as heavy as 'gill gets. Riding shotgun was a conservative portion of house-cut fries, which I guess makes sense since it was inauguration day and Trump was taking control. They were extremely well-fried and provided a welcome respite from the doughy batter, but I can only wish another spud or two would have slipped into the fryer. Some thick, house tartar was also very good and put the batter in its place as much as any sauce could hope to. Its brawn and zest went blow for blow with each of the bloated swimmers adding a little allure to every bite. A pre-buttered hamburger-looking bun was on the plate, but thats about all there is to say about it, while an understated slaw was pleasing. The cabbage derivative was flat-out easy to eat with nothing offensive whatsoever. More slaws should be like this one. OBDH is a nice place and there is a lot to like about it. It's a far cry from its predecessor, the South Bay, which is a good thing since they were seemingly doing just enough to get by. The fish at Off Broadway is good, but just not as good as some of the other stuff out there. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry, but probably won't seek it out on a week to week basis. offbroadwaydrafthouse.com/5404 Raywood RoadMadison, WI 53713     (608) 630-9111",2505,0.214507722007722,0.5497812097812098

It certainly wasnt without its charms. It had decent fish (if you got your order within an hour, that is). It looked like a diner that someone turned into a bar. Ititit never really made us want to come back, but it didnt push us away either. It was just the South Bay, and that was that.In all honesty, we had no idea the South Bay even closed down. Of course, we dont keep that close of tabs on that sort of stuff, so when we heard about the new Off Broadway Drafthouse we were a little surprised to see it was in the old South Bay building. The OBD is cosmetically waaaaaaaay nicer than South Bay ever was and features a similar, albeit scaled down, Fish Fry on Fridays. The Throwback Special goes for fourteen beans and is either cod or lake perch. Since we were new to the Drafthouse we werent sure what to get, but decided on the perch which looked pretty once it arrived, but had some flaws. The five fillets were high quality, but had a thick beer batter that buried delicate fish. In all honesty, the batter had a great flavor, but a 50/50 fish to batter ratio simply doesnt work for me. In retrospect, we should have stuck with the cod as I bet the beefy batter works perfectly on those thicker cuts. Like so many establishments in 2016, Off Broadway features frites. These Belgian-inspired spuds were definitely cut in-house, but unlike a lot of places that prize their frites, the portion was pretty small even the separate cone we got for the little man was on the small side  especially when compared to those at Brasserie V (the Gold standard) that we just had earlier in the week. Cozying up next to the perch was some homemade aioli-style tartar. It was as thick as they come and had a great flavor that the beefy batter had no problem soaking up. A crusty little bun and some house-made slaw came with the fish and were better than most of their contemporaries. The roll added some welcome warmth, while the slaw had a great consistency although it was rather bland. Off Broadway is the current flavor of the month and the place was bumpin this Friday. Theyre clearly getting plenty of support from the neighborhood and with good reason. The food has a lot of potential, and although the perch missed that mark there was still a lot to like about the meal as a whole.

And most importantly, it’s a given that lake perch will be served on Friday nights.<p>The Bayside Tavern in Fish Creek knows the drill, and proudly displays their $18 “Perch Fry” sign in the window (I should have snapped a pic). This is truly a superb rendition of the Wisconsin classic and well worth the lofty price tag.  Three big butterflies with a light beer batter arrive on a pillow of fries and look amazing. The batter is superbly seasoned, but still light and flaky. The expertly executed exterior lets the fish shine through which is a hallmark of the best of the best. This perch was so flaky, so delectable, that it could easily be eaten with or without tartar which is a feat few fish can claim. </p><p>The aforementioned pillow of fries are shoestring-style and although pretty plain and slightly under-fried, made a nice resting place for the big six. The tartar was much better and as thick and creamy as they come.

While it looked a little snotty it was far better than eating your buggers…unless you’re a four year old, in which case it might be a toss-up. The beans were BBQ infused and made this a Fish Fry that just keeps on giving. They were a big bonus that took everything from great to exceptional. </p><p>Door County is one of our favorite places to get away and the Bayside may have just become our go-to Friday night spot.

The restaurant is in a fancy mansion on a hill in New Glarus and the everyday menu is as swanky as most youll find Madison. Luckily for us they have a Fish Fry special on Fridays which is affordable for a family of three. For $14.00 you get your choice of lake perch or cod and since we were the first patrons of the evening everything happened in a flash. The owners daughter, Hannah, got us a basket of warm rolls the second our butts hit the seats allowing us ample time to soak up the superb starch. These homemade morsels were ultra-plush and doughy and had a little something sweet which made the Grassland butter extra delectable. The fish followed in short order and looked impressive. Four fat lake perch lorded over the plate and were so large it made me wonder if they were real yellow perch. While they could have just been on the beefy side, my gut tells me they were likely a different species of perch. Regardless, the fish was flaky and highlighted by a light panko breading with a noticeable amount of dill. Overall, it was good, but not what Id call the genuine article. In lieu of French fries (this place is fancy after all), some parmesan potatoes played the part of side dish. The cubed spuds were slathered with a thick parmesan sauce which was decent, and well thought out, but as a fry guy Id still rather just have those. Some truly tremendous tartar buddied up to the perch with a thick texture and potent punch. Its creamy substrate overshadowed some dilly undertones just enough so that you knew the herb was there but just barely. Finishing things off was some buttermilk slaw that had a nice consistency and good flavor. Like everything else, it was well-balanced and added to the experience without drawing a bunch of unwanted attention.  Just because a place is fancy doesnt mean they cant make a mean Fish Fry, but they often tend to overthink things, or try to overdo it with unique spins. This is a perfect example of pushing the envelope just enough without going overboard. The dill in the breading worked, the parmesan potatoes were unique without being pretentious, the tarter was outstanding, and the homemade slaw and roll were divine. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry, and think it adds another fine option to the New Glarus Fish Fry scene. kristisrestaurant.com119 5th AvenueNew Glarus, WI 53574     (608) 527-2012",2417,0.21590556182947485,0.5552700922266139

Hell, even those that look the part dont always make the grade, which is exactly the case with the fish at the Boathouse.Just as every Fish Fry isnt a slam dunk, every website isnt up to date, and the Boathouses is one of those*. Going in we expected to see cod and perch on the menu, but in 2016 only the perch remain, which is lucky for us since that is what we were after. The 5-piece perch runs $14.00 and is beer battered, which is a bit of a departure from tradition, but Im always one for trying something new if it worksthis didand it didnt. For starters they kept the beer batter light, which is a good thing (hefty batter can bury delicate fish like perch). Unfortunately, despite the alcohol infusion it was totally lacking in flavor. I love that it was the real deal yellow perch, but burying it under the batter didnt work resulting in a ho-hum rendition. Trolling the perch was a small (and I emphasize small) helping of shoestring fries. While the spuds were well-fried and tasty, the portion was so conservative that I couldnt help but laugh. There were easily less than 20 total sticks which paled in comparrison to the amount that came with the kids chicken fingers meal. The kid gets 3x as many as I do? Something is just bassackwards about that whole setup. Where the fries fell short on size a cup of Wienkes tartar sauce did not (it fell short in other areas). This strange brew came in a massive cup with an orangey color and a whole lot of who knows what else. It had a semi-sour flavor which wasnt really pleasant and didnt do much to compliment the perch. One of Grandmas dinner roll was dropped in the paper-lined basket and for some reason was sort of surprising to see. Maybe our expectations have gotten so low that we didnt even expect anything at all, or maybe we thought the Boathouse would go bigger, but for whatever it was unexpected. The Boathouse Slaw was of the creamy persuasion and likely the best thing this Fry has to offer. Unfortunately, like the fries, the portion was small and depleted in an instant. For all the years weve lived in Madison we really havent taken advantage of all the Edgewater has to offer. Weve hung out on the pier a couple times, and we had drinks in the lounge back in the day, but never stayed in the hotel or eaten in any of the restaurants. Well, we figured that had to change and it did, but not necessarily for the better. Overall, we dont recommend this Fish Fry and dont see ourselves coming back for it, which is too bad since it has some good things going for it, like the amazing view of Lake Mendota. *The online menu has since been updated.www.theedgewater.com/dining-at-the-edgewater/the-boathouse/1001 Wisconsin PlaceMadison, WI 53703     (800) 922-5512",2797,0.09917794970986461,0.5229690522243714

The location along the Mississippi basically requires that fish be fried on Fridays, but most places simply take the easy way out with cod. Lake perch? Laughable. Bluegill? Bah. Walleye? Yeah, youll find that, but not usually as a special. The Big Muddy, and Western Wisconsin in general, is known for its catfish and thats what people have come to expectthat, and cod. Always codSince Im like most people, and know how hit-and-miss catfish can be, I stuck to the cod when I visited the Spring Lake Inn. Both cod and catfish come AYCE for ten measly skins, but I figured what they hey, cod is what everyone does, so I should just try and fit in, right? Not a bad choice, but somewhat regrettable. The Spring Lake Inn is kind of a bar-supper club hybrid and thus dole out the whole shebang before the fish. A big relish tray (bowl) comes stocked with carrots/celery/radishes/green onion/hot peppers and some sort of ham dip  yes, ham dip. It was an impressive start, only further bolstered by Grandmas dinner roll and plenty of butter. Some standard creamy coleslaw capped it off with a kick and while this aint a supper club they do the relish tray more justice than most. The fish, fries, and tartar were soon to follow and looked as good as they tasted. The first plate (it was AYCE dontcha know) had four pieces of cod of varying sizes. This was just flat-out solid cod. It held no grease, had a great flake, and was coupled with a light beer batter that had just enough flavor to let you know its there. When it comes to cod this stuff was in harmony and all was right with the universe. Some steak fries accompanied the cod and were fine but nothing you havent seen before. Cripsy. Crunchy. Adequate. A thick and creamy tartar trolled the cod and really helped when it could, but since the cup was only about ¼ full I really had to ration. Sure, I could have had more, but the place was busy and the waitress was doing all she could to manage the bar and the adjacent eating area so I just let sleeping dogs lie. The cod could hold its own so all was not lost on a slim smattering of sauce. I love getting out of the city and hitting up the small town frys and the Spring Lake only reinforced that belief. This was an all-around great experience and Id have no problem telling others to take the trip to PDC to give it a whirl. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and think its a great example of everything the river has to offer.

As soon as I saw Park Street's newest addition had a Fish Fry I had to give it a whirl. It turned out to not be a trip worth taking and I said as much in my review of it.While I have no idea if my words influenced the change, one has been made...a big one, and for the better. The walleye has been replaced by a big old slab of haddock and it was a sage decision on the 'hound's part. While the fillet costs 15 big bucks it's totally worth it as this monster rings in at 9 full onces (that's over half a pound for you counting at home). This behemoth was  moist and flaky and offset by a light beer batter that was about 1/10th the thickness of the old stuff. It was really excellent and while I usually prefer smaller chunks (which ensures a higher fish:batter ratio) the well-seasoned breading corralled this monster with ease. Whereas the fish has taken a dramatic turn for the better the fries stayed the course. They were good, although slightly under-fried, and not cut in-house. Regardless, the princely portion didn't give an inch to the hearty haddock and lasted just as long. Rockhound definitely isn't afraid to pile on the grub. The homemade tartar was also as superb as the fish and took center stage with a sweet zing and what appeared some mustard seeds. Despite the fillet being huge it endured the test since it could be used sparingly. As it should do, it nudged the haddock further down the line and added a flavor the fish couldn't supply on its own. If this Fry has a failing it's that there's no bread on the side which is, and will always be, a bummer. A nice sized cup of slaw lived above the rim and had a pleasant although not zippy flavor. As my dining companion remarked it was ""yummy"" and I really had no basis for disagreement. $15 might seem pricey to some, but it's pretty much standard practice in 2017, regardless of the fish being served. When you take into account the fillet is huge, the fries are ample, and there's no shortage of slaw the price tag is even more justified. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and will gladly come back again soon to crack some more of these Rocks.

Theyve been moving the masses with their menu, and blowing people away with their beer (I can vouch for that  the Sandstone Blonde was scrumptious). Unfortunately, they seemingly didnt have Fish Fry on their minds at inception and are playing catchup to some extent. The first offering of their unadvertised Friday special was a few short weeks ago and is clearly a work in progress.For sixteen beans a chunky walleye fillet is skirted by a gang of Rockhounds special fries and cups of homemade slaw and tartar. As you might expect the walleye is beer battered and its a thick one. The golden encasement is a bit overdone (as brewpubs are wont to do), but does offer a nice flavor. Predictably, the large fillet was lost beneath the hefty coating despite having plenty of its own girth. Being new to the scene they also havent mastered how to make the batter stick, so it mostly flaked off resulting in many bites of just fish or just batter. The side of spuds that flanked the fish was super. They were thick and crunchy with an appropriate amount of seasoning, which made the beer evermore enticing. While they werent cut in-house they were as tasty as freezer fries can be, and there is something to be said for that. A zesty dollop of tartar improved the fish ever so slightly with is harmonious goodness. The percentage of  mayo to relish was on point and it somehow almost lasted until the end despite the grandiose fillet which I think has to do with the fact that it practically overflowed its Solo surroundings. Last, but not least, was some creamy house slaw that had the pungent flavor of cumin scattered throughout. It really did it for me since I love cumin, but I evasion others might well be turned off by the herbaceous essence. I was more turned off by the lack of bread, which is all too common of an occurrence in 2016. Fish Fry is an intricate enigma that can take time and thought to solve. Rarely do places jump in feet first and kill it, so were not surprised to see a few pieces missing on Rockhounds puzzle. Overall, we cant recommend this Fish Fry right now, but love the place, the beer, and the veggie options (according to the wife), and will give them a shot at redemption someday soon. Only time will tell if they can solve the riddles of the Fry, but something tells me theyve got the stones to do it. rockhoundbrewing.com444 Sout Park StreetMadison, WI 53715     (608) 285-9023",2567,0.15835042150831624,0.4845181134654819

Of course the ALL I'm referring to the ultra-craft beer boom that has enveloped our country in the last couple years. AA was on the scene brewing their famous west coast IPAs long before any of there New England IPAs came on-line, when lagers and lites were still king. They were unique at the time and carved out quite a niche for themselves by adhering to strict standards - brew by the Purity Laws, let the beer speak for itself, and don't allow TV's or food in the taproom. This worked for a while, but as times changed they were slow to adapt. Bar snacks were phased in, followed by a full menu and a real deal Fish Fry some time later. Eventually deep fryers made their way into the kitchen, then TVs to the bar, and now they are even on-board the hazy IPA - cocoa nib stout - hard seltzer train. It's a HUGE departure for them to say the least...Oh the times they are a-changin'. The FF part of the AA evolution is likely my favorite part of their overall transformation. This is the genuine article Fish Fry, and time and thought were clearly put into making it all it can be. It starts with the sheer variety of fish offered; it's all the usual suspects here: cod, lake perch, bluegill, walleye, and even shrimp (if you're into that sort of thing). All the freshwater options fall at $15 with the cod being significantly less. This was a bluegill Friday for me since I'd has the cod and walleye on recent visits. $15 is on the low end price-wise for the famed freshwater fish and once I saw the portion I realized why. Only five fillets found their way to plate, which is sort of silly for bluegill. Usually you'll see at least 10, and I've even seen upwards of 14-16 for this price. Yes, you can add more for $2 each, but if you'd do that to get to the regular 10 or so it would be a $25 plate! And that's just crazy. Still the fish was really tasty, but obviously those are one bite each so it was gone in a flash. By and large it's good, but would easily fall into excellent territory had it been more plentiful. While the fish came up a fin short the fries were abundant. The portion was more than reasonable and their spicy crunch nearly stole the show. These suckers are seasoned to the nines and just keep you coming back for more and more. Sure, they're probably full of MSG or something, but I could really care less. They're awesome. One of the hallmarks of this Fry from day one has been the twin tartars - one traditional and one spicy. Those days were numbered apparently and the twins have gone their separate ways. What remains is a single cup of the traditional type. The spicy is now but a distant memory, but its absence really lets you focus on regular one (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). It's got some semblance of beer in it and as such it's not super thick, but still has some chunkiness to it. The little flat bread style biscuits have also been replaced by a plain white roll, which is well...plain. The next tweak comes in from the slaw, and while it's still 100% made in house, they seem to have dialed back the spice quotient to some extent. Sure, it was still pungent, and different than you'll find anywhere else, but I didn't find myself reaching for my beer after each bite as I recall doing previously. It took time, but once AA decided to compromise their beer-and-beer-only mentality the change was swift. Their Fish Fry instantly became one of the best around, and was incredibly accessible on Friday night leading us to say it was one of Madison's finest. As the months and years continue to roll by subtle changes are still being made though - mostly in the amount of food on the plate - and these last few tweaks haven't necessarily been for the better. The portions are smaller, the variety is lessened, and the heavy handed seasoning has been dialed back . Overall, we still recommend this Fish Fry, but not quite as highly as we once did. aleasylum.com2002 Pankratz StreetMadison, WI 53704     (608) 663-3926",4052,0.10048374106513641,0.45660274480041924

Not only does the AA fall at the top alphabetically, but they've been putting on quite a show since the later half of 2018. Their Fish Fry has gone from merely solid to one of the best the Madison area has to offer. It's been an impressive improvement in such a short period of time, and we figured we'd keep that momentum rolling to kick off the new year.We were very early this Friday and things were sloooooow in the Asylum. Very few inmates were in their cells at 4:30 which basically gave us free reign of the place and we took full advantage of that fact. AA used to just have cod and a rotating cast of characters on Fridays, but they recently expanded the menu and now have cod, lake perch, bluegill, and walleye each and every Friday! We've sampled them all on previous visits except for the walleye; so I bet you can guess what we did this time around...The walleye goes for $15 which, if you eat walleye often, you know is incredibly cheap for the lord of the lake. Fittingly, the fillet is relatively petite, which is still more than fair for that price. The 6-8 ounce chunk was 100% boneless and layered with the heavily-seasoned yet light and crispy breading that has become the AA's calling card. It was really superb, with the only downside being that there wasn't another 6 ounces to love. Like the fish, the fries at the nut house are nutty good, and share an equally insane amount of seasoning. I'm have no idea what is in the mix of spices, but by god, it's crazy good. It hits every flavor receptor known to man and makes a basic French fry ballistic. Further enhancement is found in the form of two uniquely different kinds of beer-infused tartar sauces. That's right..two kinds! The first is the spicy, which seemed less spicy than it has in the past, and the second is the regular, which seemed slightly less regular that it has in the past. Regardless, they were both scrumptious, and we were dipping anything and everything in them, draining both cups in the process. AA still gives you some bread with their fish (thank god), and while the two teeny flat breads were just so-so at least they were there. The hefeweizen slaw was also there, and nowhere near as runny as we remembered. It had an excellent sweet/zippy dichotomy going on which fell in line with the rest of the flavors from the fish to the fries and the tartars. If this first Fish Fry is any indication, 2019 is going to be one hell of a year. Everything about this one was top notch and you can see exactly what they've done to make it so. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and are finding it harder and harder to justify going elsewhere when the Ale Asylum is so good and so close to home.  aleasylum.com2002 Pankratz StreetMadison, WI 53704     (608) 663-3926",2840,0.16651244588744588,0.42741175491175476

Over the course of two recent visits we've canoodled with the cod, and perused the perch, but shied away from the beer battered bluegill and walleye out of fear the batter would be too substantial. After seeing the beer battered cod I think those fears were misplaced and we'll go again soon to give them a whirl. The cod features a superbly seasoned light breading although they list it as beer batter, so whatever. This stuff has a ton of flavor and coats the grease-free fish perfectly. The cod itself is as flaky as can be and damn near perfect all things considered. The breaded perch wasn't quite as luminescent as the cod, but was still very good. For starters, it's the real deal yellow perch which is not always the case these days. The breading was wispy but somewhat muted compared to the super-seasoned beer batter. It was pretty middle of the road as far as perch goes, but that's a pretty glamorous road all things considered. After all the time spent hoping for fries, we're happy to say it was worth the wait. Like the beer batter these suckers are seasoned to the nines (which is WAAAAAAAY over-seasoned for a 4 year old, fyi), and I loved every bite. The twin tartars still take hold with the spicy style working better with both types of fish. While the sauces are on the thin side texture-wise you'd expect that to be the case since there is Hefeweizen in them. It still slicks the surface of the fish admirably, and hell, you could just drink the stuff if it came down to it. It's that good. With so much seasoning and beer infusion here and there the slaw was an afterthought, but it's still a good one. It is house-made for sure, and falls on the creamy side of the aisle. Some nice little flat breads filled the starch component and were a welcome change from a basic dinner roll. When it comes to Friday Fish Fry there are places like Mint Mark that crush it right out of the chute, and there are places like the Dorf Haus that hone a craft over decades. Most places fall somewhere in between and slowly morph into their final form through trial and error. Some end up with greatness and some just end up with a Fish Fry. Ale Asylum is striving for greatness, hitting their stride, and I'm glad we're here to see and taste it.

Our first couple visits to the Ale Asylum were a mixed bag to say the least. The fish was decent, the twin tartars were unique, their potato casserole was promising, but there were no French fries or anything for the kids. It was never really busy which kind of points to the fact that people weren't into it. Sometime around July 2018 a fryer was finally installed and with it came fries, and a revamped Fish Fry...and by god, the changes were all for the better. AA is now slinging one the best FFs in town. Believe that!In addition to the fries the Asylum now has cod, bluegill, lake perch, and walleye EVERY FRIDAY (they used to just have cod and a rotating freshwater fish). Over the course of two recent visits we've canoodled with the cod, and perused the perch, but shied away from the beer battered bluegill and walleye out of fear the batter would be too substantial. After seeing the beer battered cod I think those fears were misplaced and we'll go again soon to give them a whirl. The cod features a superbly seasoned light breading although they list it as beer batter, so whatever. This stuff has a ton of flavor and coats the grease-free fish perfectly. The cod itself is as flaky as can be and damn near perfect all things considered. The breaded perch wasn't quite as luminescent as the cod, but was still very good. For starters, it's the real deal yellow perch which is not always the case these days. The breading was wispy but somewhat muted compared to the super-seasoned beer batter. It was pretty middle of the road as far as perch goes, but that's a pretty glamorous road all things considered. After all the time spent hoping for fries, we're happy to say it was worth the wait. Like the beer batter these suckers are seasoned to the nines (which is WAAAAAAAY over-seasoned for a 4 year old, fyi), and I loved every bite. The twin tartars still take hold with the spicy style working better with both types of fish.

Of course, the Asylum also serves food, and while it's not as good as the beer (relatively speaking), their Fish Fry still does a lot of things right.AA always has a rotating special on Fridays (usually lake perch or bluegill), but this week we went for the every week cod, and think its easily the best thing they've done as far as FF is concerned. The cod goes for a mere $12 and is a steal when you consider the three big pieces on the plate...and if for some reason you're feeling even more glutinous, you can add additional pieces for a buck a pop - that's a $14 5-piece for those mathematicians in the audience. For some reason the dungeonous brewery is never too busy on Friday nights so it's a prime spot if you have toddlers in tow...especially if those toddlers like fried fish - ours usually does, but wanted pizza (flatbread) this week (which they also have). The cod is home to a light and ultra-crunchy breading that has a decent amount of flavor thanks to the house-brew infused coating. The fish itself was plenty of flaky, but held together for the most part. It was easily better than either freshwater fish we've had previously, and what we'd recommend to newcomers. The inmates in the kitchen don't get down with French fries, but the inordinate amount of Parmesan potato casserole they plop on the side more than make up for it. These suckers are rich and creamy and boast a crust that would make mom proud. I swear to god there was at least a half pound of them and while most people would have boxed a bunch of them, I didn't take home a single morsel. Most places (and people) are comfortable with a single style of tartar with their fish, but not this Asylum. No, no! They trot out two varieties - one regular and one spicy...insanity! Both are one the thin side (which is probably due to the Unshadowed hefeweizen (beer) infusion), but the spicy was far too spicy this time - like hard to eat spicy, and the plain had a good balance to level tings off. Batch Bakery has a great rep in town and it's nice to see them represented at this Fry, but the slab of French on the side was minuscule are best. Sure it was good, but literally, one bite...one. A very nice homemade slaw made up for it somewhat and capped things off without drawing much attention to itself.The Ale Asylum in roughly in our neighborhood and we're sure glad it is. We spend a decent amount of time at their bar and have made their tasting room one of our favorite Friday fall backs.

Hard to believe, I know, but it’s true. While it would be nice if that was a 1:1 correlation the fact of the matter is that it’s not. Of course, if that were the case the Ale Asylum would have some of the best Fish Fry known to man, but as it stands they are still learning the ropes.The AA never even had a FF until a couple months ago and dipped their toe in the water with a ”bluegill” Fish Fry that wasn’t even real bluegill. We reviewed it as such and perhaps based on that, or perhaps not, they’ve changed their ways. They are now doing the standard cod Fish Fry every Friday (smart move) along with a rotating cast of characters weekly. This week the rotator was lake perch and we jumped at the chance to sample it.Whereas the cod has the same beer batter that came with the “bluegill” the perch is dry battered with dry being the operative word. This batter was as coarse as they come, although excessively seasoned. It was hard to tell exactly what was going on with it, but the crunchy breading definitely crushed the delicate fish (which was the real deal yellow lake perch, btw). While I liked the direction they are taking with it they could probably shake some of the coating off before it takes the plunge. As it stands, it’s okay, but a far cry from the moist flaky bits you can find just across the road. The plate runs $15 and they’ll let you tack on additional fillets for $2 for apiece (which is super handy if you have little ones with you).If you seek asylum in fried potatoes the AA isn’t the pace for you as you won’t find fries anywhere on the menu. A nice pile from a cheesy hash brown casserole sits in their stead and is large and in charge. This lavish loaf definitely takes precedence over the plate and wows with its creamy innards and crisp crust. For our money it’s the best part of the deal and an above average spud option.Two variations of Unshadowed tartar come with every Fry and are both appealing in thie ron right. The spicy style definitely brings the heat and the plain offers a welcome respite for those who can’t handle the heat. While they are both on the thin end of the spectrum they are both welcome additions, especially when you consider the drenching necessitated by the breading. A nice slab of rosemary sourdough bread as well as some homemade slaw round out the plate and got destroyed by yours truly. The bread was different than most any you will find and the homemade slaw is definitely a crowd-pleaser.It takes years for some places to find their stride where Fish Fry is concerned and it can be a bumpy ride in getting there. For most, incremental improvement is key and that’s exactly what the Ale Asylum has going for it. Sure, this Fish Fry still didn’t blow our socks off, but we liked it more than the one we had previously and think our next visit will be even better (we’ve heard good things about the cod). Overall, we still barely recommend this Fish Fry but can see it taking a huge leap with a few subtle changes. The beer is obviously already highly recommendable.aleasylum.com2002 Pankratz StreetMadison, WI 53704     (608) 663-3926",3154,0.19610696517412934,0.5186792229329542

It never computed in our fish-centric brain that a brew pub with the credibility of the Ale Asylum could not offer a Friday Fish Fry. It simply didnt make sense to us, and apparently it finally didnt make sense to them anymore either. After all these years it finally happenedAA is a FF joint!The Asylums Fry is of the bluegill persuasion and kind of foo-foo (as you might expect). For $15 three LARGE fillets dominate the plate and really make you wonder: Is this even bluegill? I dont think it is honestly, as Ive never seen any quite this size before. The purported gill is bathed in a big beer batter that is pretty thick, but still surprisingly light. The Madtown Nut Brown imparts a really good flavor that offsets the ultra-fishy freshwater fillets finely. If they were indeed bluegill they were god damned record breakers, and while the musk of any pan fish suits my palate I can see how some might be put off by the strong stank. Parmesan encrusted garlic mashed potatoes sat in for the typical French fries and were superb. A big old spoonful of the goopy goodness weighed down a good 1/3 of the plate and beckoned diners to dig deeper with each passing bite. They were rich and gooey, and better than mom could ever hope to make (sorry mom). Two kinds of Unshawowed tartar sauce gave the gill a boost, each in their own unique way. The regular rendition was thin but gave the fish a nudge in the right direction while the ghost pepper guy added some heat that took things to a whole other level. We love the variety but would go spicy if forced to pick just one. A nice thin slice of rosemary sourdough did its part without drawing much attention, which was actually good since the sassy house slaw demanded every bit of it. The irregular cuts of cabbage a carrot didnt look like anything special but the proof is in the pudding and this stuff had character. This Fish Fry certainly isnt without its fleas, but by and large it passed the test. The bluegill designation was definitely dubious but everything else was the genuine article. Overall, we still recommend this Fish Fry, and will likely try it again at some point, if for no other reason than we love hanging out at the AA with a pint of Bedlam!. That stuff is as good as gold. The fish? Maybe Bronze. aleasylum.com2002 Pankratz StreetMadison, WI 53704     (608) 663-3926",2426,0.21651046943600127,0.5673830306809031

It takes excellence and consistency to stay on top which is one reason we came back to the Hilltop only a month or so after our initial visit.Our first visit was essentially flawless, from the fish to the service everything was on point. This time we had the same waitress and basically the same experience so the consistency is definitely there. The main difference was that on this visit we just got cod, while last time we tried the cod and the lake perch. The full portion costs $15.00 and came in the blink of an eye. Of course, before the blink some homemade rolls with cinnamon honey butter hit the table and set the stage for the show that was to come. The rolls are warm and supple with a welcome crustiness that sets them apart from a basic store-bought dinner roll. Four squat pieces of cod filled out the order and were just what most Wisconsinites are after. Each was soft and flaky, and fell apart effortlessly. The slightest bit of greased ensured moistness and gave the exterior a subtle sheen. It also served to lube the gullet as each bit slid down with ease. The basic beer batter flaked off the surface of the cod at the slightest touch but kept things intact for the most part. All in all, it was a good, but not quite excellent rendition. A batch of battered fries had a satisfying crunch and were portioned perfectly next to the four beefy bits of cod. Offsetting the fish was a milky tartar that had a yellowish hue and enough dill and relish to make it interesting. It added just enough of a pop to the fish to make it something more. Finishing things of was some coarsely-cut slaw that boasted a ton of zip thanks to its creamy substrate. It was mostly just cabbage with some carrot smattered throughout, but the proof is in the pudding (or the dressing as it were). It appears like the Hilltop is the real deal and nothing close to a canines posterior. Both visits have been on point and were sure to be back again. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry but will likely go perch over cod from here on out. Both are good, but the perch is a cut above. thehilltopcp.com4173 Co Hwy PCross Plains, WI 53528     (608) 798-2893",2330,0.27407407407407397,0.46534391534391545

A restaurant as it were. Its not on the way to anywhere in particular and its not all that easy to find if you dont know the area. Its a bit of an odd location to be sure, but one that makes it a destination. The appropriately named Hilltop (formerly Hilltop Inn) is this place, and its a destination worth finding.On Friday the Hilltop has lake perch, cod, and a half potion of cod for $17, $14, or $11 respectively. Before the fish finds its way to the table some doughy dinner rolls do. These buggers are clearly made on the premises and served with some cinnamon butter that melts the instant it hits the warm buns. They are super starchy and deviously inviting making it extremely difficult to stop after devouring just one. Six real deal yellow perch fillets make up the fish contingent of the Fry and come cloaked in beer battered (which is generally a no-no in my opinion). Thankfully, this BB is pretty light and still lets the delicate flavors of the fish come through. Since the batter has a good flavor of its own, a harmonious balance is struck, resulting in some of the best beer battered freshwater fish I can remember eating. A bit of batter also lends the fries a welcome crunch, and although they appeared as though theyd be limp, they were anything but. While not cut in-house they were a very respectable for frozen rendition. Some homemade tartar canoodles with the promiscuous perch adding a saucy zip to its already creamy character. The homemade slaw also had plenty of pep, and while coarsely cut, finishes smooth. The new Hilltop has found their footing quickly and are already serving up a very commendable Fish Fry. Whats more, our waitress, Julie, was on point throughout the meal and kept us all happy (especially our little guy). It was a bang up job by her and a bang up job by the Hilltop in general. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and see it as a destination we will be seeking out frequently. thehilltopcp.com4173 Co Hwy PCross Plains, WI 53528     (608) 798-2893",2083,0.21078529194382858,0.5130105937423011

Raw fish? Got that. Vegetarian? An afterthought. Vegan? Please Even the gluten-free folks can find plenty of palate pleasers, whether it be food, drink, or even the classic Friday Night Fish Fry and beer. There are a few gluten-free Frys in town (jacs immediately jumps to mind), but those mostly feel tacked-on to the regular menu. Never have we seen a solely gluten-free Fish Fry paired with solely gluten-free beer, but thats exactly what we found when Smokin Cantina set up shop in the parking lot at Alt Brewing Co.This one-off Fish Fry cost a lofty $18.00 for a 3-piece and $15.00 for a 2-piece turned out to be way too expensive (especially when you consider there wasnt even any gluten). It was clear from the beginning that, even while it was advertised, this was still a bit of an ad hock affair. From payment to ordering, it seemed like they were flying by the seat of their pants from the get-go. The fish was fried in the parking lot and was ready quickly so at least the prep part was running smoothly. It wound up being a lot of food, and while it looked nice when it was placed on the picnic table more than just the gluten seemed to be missing. The three cod fillets were big and meaty but also a little limp and mushy. The soggy loins were home to a bubbly and crispy batter that got soggy in spots due to some trapped grease. The batter also didnt have much flavor of its own, which led to it feeling heavy. While the fish fell flat the hand-cut wedge fries soared to great heights. They were the real deal, with supple centers and snappy skins. They are probably something the Cantina does all the time which explains why they were on point while the cod stumbled out of the gates. Practice makes perfect in this case.  A thick tartar came with the cod and while it helped when it could one paper cup wasnt quite enough to run with the chunky fillets. There was also no bread with the $18 Fry which I suppose isnt all that surprising when youre talking gluten-free. The slaw was fresh but a little too basic in our opinion. It was just coarsely-cut red and green cabbage with a bit of vinegar sprinkled on. It was really raw, and nearly impossible to get a fork through which, as you might have guessed, made it very difficult to eat. As you probably gleaned Alt is a 100% gluten-free brewery and the beer we tried was pretty darn good. Unfortunately, the same cant be said of the 100% gluten-free Fish Fry. Overall, we dont recommend this Fish Fry and probably wouldnt come back around if it happens to.  www.facebook.com/smokincantina/home1808 Wright StreetMadison, WI 53704     (608) 438-9643",2679,0.06224916387959868,0.4483695652173914

You could call it verification, or second guessing myself, but in reality Im just a sucker for finding tasty fish at places I havent been to a hundred times. When the crew from WisSports.net reached out looking for a spot near Stoughton this Friday I threw out the Squirrels Nest hoping theyd take the bait. They did, and I got my chance to confirm my findings.Big Norb, Travis, and Travis younger brother were there early and secured one of the few actual tables in the tiny nest. It was well before kickoff so we had plenty of time to BS and wait for our fish, which wasnt really even necessary since it fried in a flash once we actually put our order in. The Squirrel slings cod for nine beans or walleye for 11 and all four football fans tried the cod. As on our last visit some Merkts cheese spread and cellophane sticks hit the table beforehand and almost stole the show. Its such an unexpected accompaniment for a bar that its easy to get lost in the ajo, cebolla, or blanco bliss. The fry station at the Squirrel is about 10 square feet so its somewhat surprising they can cook the cod as quickly as they do. Three average sized pieces of fish come with the same light breading that adorned the walleye on our last visit. This breading is light and holds the flaky fish together, but could definitely use some supplemental seasoning. While it works well with the walleye since the freshwater fish has so much inherent flavor, its a little lackluster on the cod. Still, its a nice, greaseless rendition although not a knock-your-socks-offer. A little more spice would undoubtedly bump it into excellence. Following the slightly downward trend were the hash browns which lacked some of the allure that had us swooning initially. This version was more loaf-like than the slick, melty, greasers we were hoping for based on round one, and while they were still good, the amount of onion and cheese was dialed way back which left us slightly soured. While the fish was good, some stupendous tartar made it all the better. It had plenty of pop which made the under-seasoned cod much more appetizing. A real roll, and a peppy, albeit goopy looking, slaw did their part and made cost even more appealing. The Nest gives you three pieces of fish, a generous portion of hash browns, a roll, some slaw, tartar, AND cheese and sticks all for a measly nine bucks. Nine bucks! It has to be some of the cheapest Fish Fry you will find anywhere and one we feel good about recommending. Overall, we do recommend this Fish Fry, and while it regressed from our initial trial it is still very tasty and a deal that is too good to pass up. www.facebook.com/Squirrels-Nest-382143498543529/2655 US Route 51McFarland, WI 53558     (608) 838-0293",2837,0.15077160493827163,0.3953703703703705

Its a small bar. Its unassuming. Its out of the way. Its cheap. And most importantly, it has an amazing Fish Fry. While the choices arent endless the Nest does have a couple fish to suit your fancy including an $11 walleye and a $10 cod. Both styles come with a cup of tartar, hash browns or French fries, slaw, a roll, and some cellophane sticks with Merkts cheese spread. The first foodstuffs to hit the table (or bar in my case) are the slaw and the sticks & spread, both of which will make you think youve died and gone to a high-end supper club. The finely-chopped slaw is generally creamy with a noticeably sweet twinge before a horseradish kiss set it off. The cheese spread and the sticks are no different from the classic supper club standby and are something Ive never seen served with a tavern Fish Fry. Awesome, to say the least. Not long after you get your fill of the onion, garlic, or plain sticks the fish will find its way to you. The walleye fillet is average-sized, but when youre talking eleven measly bucks thats one heck of a deal. The fillet is lovingly prepared and fried in hot oil ensuring a grease free preparation. Making itself at home on the flaky fillet is a light and crispy flour breading that has just enough seasoning to let you know its there, but no so much that it overcomes the walleye musk. A thick and creamy tartar compliments the freshwater fish admirably, giving it a gentle nudge towards excellence. The lone piece of cooking equipment in addition to the deep fryer is a flat top grill, but thats all they need to make some of the best hash browns that have ever graced my gullet. The spuds are loaded with plenty of shredded cheddar and chopped onion and turned while grilling. This turning action allows the cheese to fully penetrate every pore of the potato pile, and sweats the onion without allowing them to crisp on the hot surface. Its an expert preparation which yields excellent results. Since the sticks & cheese came before the fish I figured that was going to comprise the entirety of the starch contingent, but I was wrong. A real dinner roll came alongside the fish and was fresh, but little else. Still, thats plenty of bread to go around and double what a lot of places give out in 2016. Some might call it a hole in the wall (or maybe hole in the tree in this case), and theyd be right. The place is small, maybe seating for 35 including the bar, but what it lacks in size it more than makes up for in substance. When you take into account this is a full Fish Fry (and then some) for only $11, the argument can be made that its the best deal in the area. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and see it becoming a staple in our Friday arsenal.

Since I didn't have the time to jaunt all the way up to Lake Wisconsin I did some local recognizance and decided that it was time to give Breakwater another shot. After looking at their menu I noticed the had changed their Fish Fry preparation (no more salt and vinegar chip crusts) and their price (only $10.50 for a 3-piece lunch) so it seemed the stars were aligning. I scooped up the little man and we were in Monona faster than you can say ""I'll take River West Stein Beer.""The multi-tiered back patio at Breakwater overlooks the Yahara and had a decent number of full tables this Friday. It took a moment for the waitress to notice where the hostess sat us and bring us some menus and even longer for her to retrieve the aforementioned Stein Beer from the bar. Things weren't off to the best of starts, but she was very pleasant despite appearing slightly overwhelmed by amount of work in front of her. The fish came is a reasonable time frame, although it came sans-silverware. Since I like to eat my fish with my fingers that wasn't a huge deal, although I didn't get at the coleslaw for a good 5 minutes while we waited for her to retrieve the knife and fork. As far as the fish goes, the pieces were super small - practically bite size if you've got a big mouth like me. The meat was nice and flaky and Alaska Amber made for a very tasty beer batter, but it's really tough to gage since there wasn't a ton of it. The fish:batter ratio was spot on, but in all honesty you would need at least three more pieces of this size to make a decent portion. I know $10.50 is pretty cheap, but those three teeny wieners essentially added up on nice sized piece. Some fat Julienne-cut freezer fries sat shotgun and came in a much more standard portion. While there wasn't anything special about them, they did their job, and weren't gone within a minute. Like the fish, a soupy tartar also missed the mark despite having a nice flavor. It was more of a salad dressing consistency which had it slip sliding off the surface before you could even get it from the dish to your mouth. Somehow bread has become faux pas in 2018 but the places that are keeping with the tradition seem to be going all the way with real rye, and Breakwater is no exception. It was a great addition to the meal, but unfortunately the same can't be said for the uninspired slaw that I waited 5 minutes to get a mouthful of. Breakwater has a pretty idyllic location in reality although getting to the actual restaurant can be a little awkward. First timers are met with a confusing entryway of stairs or elevator, both of which eventually lead to the second floor eatery. Once you're there however, everything comes together and is highlighted by the water front setting. Unfortunately, the Fish Fry (while revamped) still has a little way to go. The portion was just too small, and the service too scatter-shot to say this is one you've got to try. Overall, we don't recommend this Fish Fry but love the waterfront location and hope they can capitalize on it with some more tweaks. www.facebook.com/BreakwaterMonona/6308 Metropolitan LaneMonona, WI 53713     (608) 416-5388",3280,0.14451108116202455,0.5483602875112309

Is it a pull-it-out-of-the-freezer-and-drop-it-in-some-hot-oil kind of place, or is it a carefully-choose-the-most-pristine-sustainably-sourced-freshwater-fish-we-can-find-and-lightly-pan-sear-it-to-reduce-fat-intake kind of place. Both speak volumes about the rest of the menu, and while both can be good, in actuality, the best Fish Frys tend to come from restaurants that fall somewhere in the middle  not lowbrow, but not too snooty either. The Breakwater trends towards the snooty, but not overly so. The Friday special at Breakwater is a $16.00 walleye plate that is clearly unique and fresh, but maybe trying a bit too hard to be so. For starters our waitress was on the slow side. From simply coming over to say hi, to getting the initial round of drinks, to delivering the food, everything was a step behind where youd like it to be. When the fish did show, it was cooling and looked unlike any other walleye Ive seen. Instead of one large fillet or even a couple smaller baby walleye filets (like youd expect) Breakwater serves their fish in four petite pieces. The quartet was probably only 6 ounces or so total, and on the thin side. Each was coated in a very unique salt & vinegar potato chip batter that had a distinctive flavor and a big crunch. This batter would certainly have worked wonders on a fat fillet, but totally took over the waifish cuts leaving no walleye flavors to be found. Where the cuts of fish were a bit pretentious, the house-cut fries were the genuine article. They came in a huge portion which dwarfed the wee walleye and supplemented it to some extent. While its not a one-to-one tradeoff these damn-near-perfect spuds did their best to make this Fish Fry all it could be. The tartar was good, albeit on the thin end of the spectrum. It had a good pop but was more of a dripper than a clinger and more ranch-y than mayo-y. Like the fries the slaw was also clearly made in-house and composed of roughly a 50/50 cabbage/carrot blend. It was big on the vinegar, but also had some cream which struck a surprisingly pleasant compromise. A unique bread choice could have been the starch to pull this Fish Fry back from the brink, but alas it wasnt meant to be. No bread came with the meal, and when taken in context with the other shortcomings it might be the straw that breaks the camels back on this one. Breakwater has a great culinary philosophy as near as we can tell and it was reflected (although not capitalized on) by the Fish Fry. Fresh and unique seems to be the vibe here, and while the fries did all they could, they couldnt salvage the other weaknesses. Overall, we dont recommend this Fish Fry, but the pizza my wife got was superb so we have to believe there is hope for smoother seas ahead. www.facebook.com/BreakwaterMonona/6308 Metropolitan LaneMonona, WI 53713     (608) 416-5388",2922,0.1895074696545285,0.5332399626517274

Long ago we attempted to get a Fish Fry at 608 when they were on State Street. Their sandwich board said FISH FRY so we figured there would at least be cod or something. It turned out the board was advertising a tilapia sandwich (or some such nonsense) so we swiftly removed ourselves from that situation. After that they promptly fell off our radar only to reemerge with a new theme and at the new location on Fordem Ave.608 is now a sports bar and a nice one at that. On Friday, they have a 2-piece cod special for $9.00, and I must admit, it looks nice on the rectangular plate. The façade quickly fades however, once you realize how small the portion actually is. Two pieces that are maybe a couple ounces each make up the entirety of it and they disappear in a flash. It does have a nice batter with a little crunch (kinda fried chicken in that regard), but no seasoning to speak of. It essentially has a good consistency, but since there isnt much of it, its a letdown in the end. A batch of McDonalds style fries come along, but miss the McDoanlds level of satisfaction. Its a hearty portion for sure, but it lacks any sort of allure. The tartar also doesnt draw much affection with its lemony sweetness and slightly runny consistency. Most places are phasing out the bread all together thanks to this gluten-free craze, but 608 doesnt seem to care and brings a big old slab of marble rye to the party (with pre-applied butter no less). Its a big win and one that salvages the integrity of this Fish Fry in some regard. Of course, when integrity is saved, some is bound to be lost and 608 doesnt serve any slaw with their lunch special. Weird, I know While this Fish Fry has some good things going for it, and I would like to recommend it, the portion of fish is just too small and there just isnt much to draw one back in.

It's an unassuming tavern (just how I like it). It's in the middle of nowhere (so only the locals really know about it). And maybe most importantly, they don't over think things (especially their Fish Fry). It's a no nonsense, no frills affair, and it's no wonder these kind of places keep me coming back for more.Sure, it's only cod, but this Fry comes in three different sizes so there is some diversity to it. Diners can satisfy their appetite with a 2, 3, or 4-piece for $8, $9, or $10 respectively. That's right, $10 for a 4-piece cod complete with all the trimmings, where else are you going to find that kind of deal other than  tavern? While the fish takes its soak some canned baked beans, coleslaw, and a basket of rolls are served up. The slaw is a basic creamy blend, and the beans would surely make the Bush's smile, but the real standout is the bread basket which had a couple little corn muffins, a soft white bun, and the real star - a fresh pumpernickel roll. It's an impressive lineup considering you're talking about a $9 Fish Fry at a bar here.Before we even got our fill of the apps this Friday, the fish was fried and found us in a jiffy. It looked great, but didn't quite live up to the hype we'd placed on it. The light breading that we fell in love with last time lacked some of the seasoning that drew our affection, and while it was still flaky, it had to be ripped apart to some extent (much like the cod at Wilson's). That said, the crisp coating held everything together well, had no grease whatsoever, and was plentiful. The 3-piece will easily satisfy most Friday night aFISHionados. Of course there are fries, and a few other sides to choose from, but when I hear cheesy hash brown casserole those other options simply fade away. Unfortunately, these spuds weren't exactly super. Sure, they were plenty thick, and plenty creamy, and certainly made from scratch, but there was celery in it...honest to god, celery. It was odd to say the least, and while the wayward veggie didn't ruin the 'role, it certainly didn't help matters. This kind of fish calls for a big, bold tartar, and this sauce iced the cod cake just right. Maybe it was just Sysco, but maybe that's all you need sometimes and it answered the call today. There are only about 20 lily pads in this pond, and they don't serve fish at the bar, so unless you show up early you're risking a wait. We showed up at 6:00 and were one of the first tables of the night, but almost every seat was full when we left, so take that for what it's worth. Tiny taverns can be a crap shoot, but we hit tonight. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and think it's a damn good deal, even if it wasn't as special as we hoped it would be. While the Pond might not be the place, it's definitely one of those places we'll have no problem coming back to. www.facebook.com/lloydsfrogpond/?rf=9539060513246834684 County DMMorrisonville, WI 53571     (608) 846-1313",2971,0.1517865597943723,0.4942026289682541

If DeForest is out there than Morrisonville must be way out there according to some. I personally like way out there, and when I heard that Tamarack II had reopened as The Frog Pond I couldnt wait to come back. Small town bars usually have some of the best Fish Fry around, and Id hoped the Pond could prove that pointof course, it did.While T2 had all sorts of fish, the FP only has fried cod, but it comes in three different sizes - 2-piece: $9, 3-piece: $10, 4-piece: $11. I obviously went to the four banger and was glad I did. Some slaw, beans, and a roll come beforehand, and the chunky, homemade slaw has a good zip but beyond that was pretty standard. The baked beans are superb and serve as a wonderful addition to the already cheap Fry; while the roll is better than basic with a generous crust and plenty of density. Needless to say its a good start to what is a fantastic Fry. As you can imagine the 4-piece is substantial and, and made even more so when you consider each piece was a good 3-4 ounces. All are dusted with a superb breading that has a subtle blend of seasoning that tastes of celery salt and other goodies. This totally grease-free rendition makes for easy eating and mine went down in a flash despite how much of it occupied the plate (which is how you know its good). A big old scoop of cheesy hash browns looks to be straight out of a casserole dish (just like grandma would make) and while they are gooopy they taste gooody (?) yeah, lets go with thatgooody. With so much fish youd hope to get more tartar than the Surgeon General recommends and  that is exactly what the Pond puts it out there. Two 2 oz. Solo cups come along and put the smack down on the four fat finsters. This stuff is as thick and creamy as it gets with just enough of a relish pop to pair with the salty substrate of the fish. While Morrisonville might not be the first thing that comes to mind when people think about hitting the town, The Frog Pond should definitely be up there when theyre thinking about finding the fish.

Located in the old bank building, the restaurant has tons of character and is surprisingly well-situated. Needless to say we were excited to check it out, and when we saw some favorable reviews of their fish we took the first available Friday to do so.FVs has a fish special every Friday, but this week it was salmon so we just went with the standard fish-n-chips which resides on the everyday menu for $15. After some spotty service the prior week it was a relief to have a waitress who was 100% on her game. Everything arrived quickly from the drinks to the food. Turnover was also high which shows this kitchen really has their you-know-what together. On to the fishAll the reviews we saw said it was good, but ours simply wasnt. The cod was mushy, and lacked texture. The squishy fishy was home to a beer batter that was reasonably light, but glistened with grease and had little to no flavor. I was underwhelmed and even the little man remarked I dont like this fish. It was too bad because I think there is a lot of potential and the salmon special was supposedly excellent. While the fish failed the house-cut fries were aces. The portion was princely and the spuds were fried perfectly. They were little lumps of love and both fish eaters devoured them since the fish was lacking. Not helping matters was a tartar sauce that was as dilly as all get out, and on the thin end texture-wise. While it helped the fish a bit, a beefy sauce could, and would have done much more. Since this is a fish-n-chips affair you cant expect bread and Freddy lived down to it. The slaw was stupendous however, as the light vinegar base melded well with the extremely thinly-sliced cabbage. A little cilantro gave it a push in the right direction and left me wanting more. It goes without saying that you cant believe everything you hear (or read) especially on the internet, but I really thought Freddy Valentines was going to knock this out of the park. Based on the other food it looks like they should have and maybe we just hit them on an off-night. While the slaw and fries were great they just didnt cut the mustard for me. Overall, we dont recommend this Fish Fry but might give it another shot someday just to see if they can redeem themselves.

What's that you say? Impostor perch? What on earth is that and what is it doing in my city? Well, I'll do my best to explain. The impostor in this case is still fish, and in many cases it's still a variety of perch, just not the traditional yellow perch that made the Wisconsin Fish Fry famous. These pretender perch are usually Pike-Perch or European Zander, both of which are species that have similar characteristics to the traditional yellow perch, but also some pretty stark differences. The lake perch we got at Lucky's 1313 was one of these slippery suckers.$16 isn't cheap for a plate o' perch and when I saw the portion was two large fillets instead of five to seven small ones I knew I'd been had. The fish is billed as 10-12 oz of lake perch and I should have known when they quoted that amount that something was amiss - normally you are lucky to get half a pound for that price. Unsurprisingly it was not the real deal yellow perch, and while it's not false advertising (these fish are often mislabeled or intentionally misrepresented by distributors to fool consumers) it's no less disheartening. The massive fillets had all the typical characteristics of the fill-in fish - the size, and squishy rather than firm texture, and none of the subtle fishy flavors. It is usually also ""slimier"" to the touch and has a sheen on the meat. The flavor is pretty bland when compared to yellow perch and necessitates a thick beer batter to mask some of these less desirable qualities - which 1313 had. This batter was thick enough, and had a good crunch, but worked much better on the ""clean"" tasting cod we had last time around. Next time we come it will be cod all the way. Despite the fact there were only two pieces of fish they still dwarfed the allotment of fries. The spuds were about as basic as it gets, and pretty disproportionate all things considered. We lauded Lucky's cod on our last visit, but felt it was weighed down by a sour tasting tartar. I'm not sure if we just had a bad batch last time or what the deal was, but this time not was much better. It was more mayo-y and had none of the less of the funky aftertaste. For us, the change was dramatic and left us wishing we'd had the cod of visit one and the tartar of visit two. Speaking of changing things up we were disappointed to see the lovely slice of rye that we so enjoyed last time replaces by a  cornbread muffin. While the crumble cake was actually as pretty good (and not too dry as so much cornbread is) it doesn't scream fish fry to me and certainly can't make up for real rye. The slaw maintained its excellence however with a welcomed diversity that must be made on site. As Lucky's 1313 is a college bar it stands to reason they would have a college aged wait staff - and they do. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing, there is definitely a noticeable lack of dedication versus servers who are in it for the long haul. Yes, our waitress was very friendly, but also didn't ""hustle"" or come around to see how we were doing as we got into the meal. Like I say, it comes with the territory, and while it's far from a deal breaker for me, I know there are people who would go bananas at the level of service we've received on both occasions. Of course, maybe we just got two waitresses on an off day, that happens, which is why I note it but don't put much stock in it. For me it's about the food. If the food suffers because of the service then I have a problem. So, Lucky's 1313 has been hit-and-miss to say the least. We liked the cod, not the perch. We disliked the tartar once, but thought it was better the second time. We were all about the rye, but then were left to wonder where it went. It has been a very inconsistent couple of visits and when you're talking Fish Fry consistency is king. Overall, we don't recommend the lake perch at Lucky's 1313, but like the bar very much, and think the cod is worthy of a reprise. We'll be back at least once more for the rubber match. I think I'll wear green that day. www.facebook.com/luckys1313/1313 Regent Street Madison, WI 53715     (608) 250-8989",4210,0.071905188598737,0.47110513739546

We liked the original Luckys on Regent more when it was the Oakcrest, and we liked Luckys on the Lake more when it was Anchors Away at the Bridge. As far as Luckys Waunakee goes, it replaced a restaurant that itself wasnt all that great, but we werent surprised when it didnt live up to the hype either. Now comes Luckys 1313 Brew Pub (which is also on Regent Street) and it looks like they may have finally struck gold with this one.On Fridays 1313 feature a 3-piece cod for $10.25, a 5-piece for $12.25, or Perch for $14.50. Since I wasnt sure if it was real lake perch or not, I stuck to the 5-piece which winds up being a whopper of a deal at twelve and a quarter. Unfortunately, and there is no way around this, we have to start with the service. Scattered isnt the right word...absentminded maybe? Flustered? I dont know exactly, but I do know it was not good. Our college-aged waitress took our order and disappeared into the crowd  purportedly on her way to the kitchen or the POS or wherever. About 15 minutes later the fish was delivered by the kitchen, but the wifes salad didnt accompany it, nor did my tartar. Our waitress reappeared solely to take the order from the table next to us a few minutes later, at which point we caught her eye and asked for the sauce and the salad. She smiled and we felt like it would be right outit wasnt. I was famished so I ate a full piece without tartar which, to their credit, was good even sans-sauce. I ate slow and got part way into the next before the sauce finally surfaced. Unfortunately, it ended up not being worth the wait (more on that later). The tardy salad found its way to the table around an hour later after several inquiries, and well after the gents had finished their fish and relieved themselves of Luckys company with a trip to Greenbush and some McDonalds ice cream. To their credit they comped the salad without request to do so which shows they are at least somewhat business savvy. Sooooooo back to the actual food, which as we mentioned, was good. The fiver of fish was split with MFF junior and featured a golden beer batter that was substantive but didnt drown the fish. It had a smooth and creamy flavor that cuddled up to the big flaky planks of cod. The hearty pieces, two of which made for a fine fish sammich come Sunday, filled the belly with little effort. While the moderately thick batter looked like a real grease sponge there was actually almost none to be found. It was pretty remarkable really and pleasantly surprising. The best fish weve had at a Luckys, hands down. The portion of fries looked puny compared to the bountiful fish, but was actually not all that conservative. They were mostly hidden under the boatload of cod and while the thick-cut spuds were clearly straight from a bag they did the job. They were fried to the softer side of the doneness spectrum, which would likely turn some Fry fans off, but they worked just fine for me. As we mentioned above, the tartar was not worth the wait as it had a bit of an odd taste. The flavor oh-so-familiar and when we saw the Kipps truck parked next to the building we figured out why and wherethe Coliseum and back in the day at Pooleys. We didnt like it there either THe slaw is clearly made in-house and is as diverse as the come. While this level of diversity can be a bad thing, it totally worked here. Lots of fresh red and green pepper, onion, and more were finely chopped so they didnt stand out too much from the cabbage and cream, but added a welcome change. It was incredibly well balanced and one slaw I actually wanted more of. To top things off, a whole fat slice of real marble rye Pac-Maned the plate. It was so large a single butter packet wasnt near enough to cover it all. Remarkable. Like I say, weve been to every Luckys and can say this is easily the best Fish Fry weve had at any of them (despite the sloppy service). Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and will give them another chance to prove they have the total package. We think they do and are never the sort to let one bad apple spoil the bunch. www.facebook.com/luckys1313/1313 Regent Street Madison, WI 53715     (608) 250-8989",4262,0.17251030142696808,0.44878218694885363

Wellmaybe not ALL the rage, but they are having a bit of a renaissance. If you need proof just search for Wisconsin Supper Clubs or any permutation thereof and youll find books, documentaries, and lists of just about every supper club our fine state has to offer. All that said, Im not sure the Capri is on any of those lists although it damn well should be.The Capri in Columbus is as much as supper club as Ishnala, the Ding-A-Ling, or any other you can name, and of course their Friday special is composed of fisheven at lunchtime. There are luncheon plates galore as well as a non-plate special featuring cod. The lake perch luncheon runs $13.75, while the non-plate cod goes for a cool $9.25. We got one of each. As we were the first patrons of the day our food came lickity-split since our most-friendly-of-waitresses had her eye on us. Of course, before the real food came a basket of bread did. This hamper was home to some dense white slices which werent bad, but didnt taste real fresh. While it might well have just be the style it was not alluring at all, and essentially no better than a basic dinner roll. Oh well. The slaw also reared its head before the fish as was essentially the supper club standard - sliced to a middling thickness and set off with a basic creamy sauce. You know the stuff. Its dece but nothing unexpected. The real food was made up of four real yellow perch fillets which had a thick, but not-to-thick, beer batter. The creamy coating had a good flavor, but as is all too common with most batters on perch, it was all you could taste. This is why I like breading and usually pass on beer battered lake perch (because I want to taste the fish). Regardless, there was no grease present which was a small win for the average perch. Since the Capri is a supper club youd expect thick-cut battered French fries and they were indeed among the many options on the list. Our lot had a great crunch, and while they likely werent cut in-house both MFF Jr. and I could really have cared less. Last on the list was some supper club standard tartar sauce. You know this stuffits thick as the dickens and has a big bang, baby. It makes the beefy batter on the perch take heed with its pop and panache. The Capri Steak House is a Columbus staple and were glad we finally had a chance to make the trip to try their fish. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry, but think its probably a bit too far out of the way to make the drive for unless you have a good reason. The classic supper club atmosphere is excellent and I could definitely see myself pulling up to the bar for one or ten, but while the fish is good, its not a draw on its own. www.facebook.com/CapriSteakhouse/126 S Ludington StreetColumbus, WI 53925     (920) 623-4818",2805,0.14093780369290576,0.44911726595400076

On the first couple visits I was impressed with the beers I drank and some of the food I ate and thought they had a good thing going (their rooftop patio is especially alluring). While they weren't doing a ""proper"" Fish Fry, something inside told me they would eventually come around and expand fully on their daily fish and chips. Well, it took a couple months (and likely a local outcry), but the brewery finally got cooking so I figured it was time for the rubber match.As I envisioned the now fully featured special goes beyond haddock, pairing it with walleye every Friday as well as a rotating cast of characters from week to week. Since I figured I should get the lay of the land, I went for the 3-piece haddock with a side of fries (which is presumably the most popular option) over the $12 2-piece or the $17 walleye (the special this week was some sort of salmon thingy). All the fish come with a romp through their brew-room-adjacent salad bar, so let's begin there. We were early, so not many had perused the freshly-stocked bar and everything was nice and tidy. Some crisp mixed greens led things off and were quickly followed by a big bowl of verdant spinach. The roughage made a luxurious landing spot for the bevy of toppings that came next. From eggs to a variety of cheeses there was a lot to choose from and my result was a picturesque plate that would make most supper clubs green with envy. A serving tray full of warm garlicy bread sticks brought up the rear but took a backseat to none, and what's more, they still served a pleasant (although not unique) coleslaw with the fish.After smiling through a salad of this caliber one can only hope the hits keep on coming, but while the Lone Girl didn't strike out, a soft single or two was about all they could muster. The pieces of haddock were big and sported a fried chicken style breading, but it lacked any sort of seasoning. The haddock itself was limp and damn near impossible to pick up and dip for someone who likes to eat fish with their hands like me. While the fork aficionados would certainly find it easy going, when fish falls apart just by being touched I get touchy. A little grease also leeched from the flakes resulting in a slight saturation on its undercarriage. Some shoestring style fries took the place of the sweet potato/normal potato mix of yesterday, and while an improvement, still weren't all that great. They appeared to be cut in-house, but were strachy as all get out. It was odd since I typically LOVE house-cut fries, but these just didn't do it for me. So the fish was alright and the fries, while not great, still got eaten; but this is where the big whiffs came about - the tartar and the orange wedge. I don't think I'm off-base (no pun intended) when I say that traditionally Fish Fry (and fish in general) comes with lemon on the side. It seems that over millennia mankind has figured out that the acidity of the lemon brings about unique flavors in fish and whether you like that combination or not, it works. Never have I heard of oranges filling in for their citric brethren and while the concept seems feasibly the reality is not so palatable. The wedge on the side I could take or leave (I don't typically use the lemon anyway), but the zest and what appeared to be actual juice in the tartar were just too much. It really hurt the fish and 90% of what came in the cup wound up in the garbage. It's just a failed experiment in my eyes and something I assume they'll figure out before a(nother) public outcry ensues. There is a hell of a lot to like about the Lone Girl. From the patio to the beer, and that excellent salad bar, they have done a lot of things right thus far. Unfortunately for the Fish Fry, the misses add up a little more than the hits and just overwhelm the good that is done. Overall, we don't quite recommend this Fish Fry, although we'd say it's just a wedge away...  thelonegirl.com114 E Main Street #101Waunakee, WI 53597     (608) 850-7175",4064,0.15159632034632026,0.5315295815295817

While I wouldn't consider myself a foodie per se, many people assume that because I write these reviews I must be part of that culture. I'm really not, and when I got a message asking if I'd like to attend a foodie meet up I was like, no thanks...that was until I realized they were doing a Fish Fry at the Sconnie Bar. I'd wanted to revisit Sconnie despite have a crummy Fish Fry there previously, and figured this was as good of an opportunity as any give them their second chance.Sconnie has cod and lake perch on Fridays and despite having reservations about ordering the (cheap) $13 perch, I pulled the trigger when the waiter told me it was indeed five pieces (I feared a 2-piece zander for that price). It was a gamble, but it essentially paid off when the cards were down. The perch looked like the real deal, although the fillets were as itty bitty as any I've ever seen. What's more, they didn't have the signature lake perch flavor I've come to expect, but did have a light breading, although it too was also a bit drab. It was at least grease-free and easy to eat so I'll chalk it up as a win. As far as the yellow perch/zander debate goes I've heard that places are dolling up smaller zander fillets to more closely mimic the real lake perch and while I can't say whether or not Sconnie is using those tricks might explain the size and flavor of these ones...TBC The standard side served with the FF is chips (which is weird), so we upgraded to the fries and it was totally worth it. The thick julienne cuts were pretty plain, but there was still plenty to like about them. I mean, they are French fries, even bad ones are still good compared to most things. Being that the perch was pretty bland it needed a punch from a tough tartar and that's just what the Sconnie sauce delivered. It was thick and brought the bang that gave the perch that little bit of extra pizazz it was lacking. An interesting looking slaw came along for the ride and had a taste to match its appearance. It was a strange creamy/vinegar hybrid with horseradish and what appeared to be paprika on it. It was alluring and definitely added a new dimension to the meal. This Fish Fry was teetering on the borderline (and may have come up short), but a slice of real rye assured that it made the grade. More and more places are phasing out the bread altogether it's relieving to see a bar not just keeping it, but going with the most traditional starch of all. I have to say were it not for the foodie meet and greet I might not have given Sconnie another chance, but it turns out I'm glad I did. They have definitely stepped their game up, and given us a new outlook on an old Fish Fry. In addition, we got to meet some nice folks, have some interesting discussions with a real chef in town, and do what we love to do. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and think it would meet most peoples expectations...including the foodies among us. sconniebar.com1421 Regent StreetMadison, WI 53711     (608) 819-8610",3056,0.13845972035627205,0.47516016072050554

Regent Street is home to many-a great college bar and as such it draws folks like me like a moth to a bug zapper. A new Fish Fry makes these bars ever more alluring and when I read about the fish at the new Sconnie Bar I ran right over there.Sconnie used to be Lucky’s and before the Leudke’s OakCrest, both of which I “frequented” back in the day. The latest incarnation has a cod special on Fridays which cost us $16.50 for a 4-piece (the regular portion is either a $12.50 or $13.50 3-piece which either way isn’t worth it).We came for lunch this Friday and the fish took a surprisingly long time despite the fact the place wasn’t busy at all. Regardless, it all arrived in good shape and was plenty hot. The pieces of cod were large, and while they were supposedly home to a Spotted Cow beer batter, it looked like more of a breading to me. Either way, the crust didn’t have much flavor and was overly crisp. Furthermore, the fish was greasy and just sort of missed the mark in general. It just didn’t have it.A boatload of fries came sat in with their skins intact. The thick spuds were pretty good all things considered but still just cooked-to-order freezer fries. Basic.While the fries were average, and the fish below, the tartar fell through the floor. This stuff was atrocious, and I don’t use that term lightly. It had a skunky flavor that actually made the fish worse. There was a ton of dill and a whole bunch of other stuff that just didn’t gel. There is a chance that it was made in-house, but I sincerely hope not.The highlight of the meal was most definitely they real pumpernickel rye, which is certainly saying something. Bread should never be the highlight… The slaw was just Sysco (I think) which is a creamy variety with a subtle hint of horseradish. Meh.Fish Fry aside, the Sconnie Bar is actually really nice. They cleaned up the dingy old Lucky’s nicely and I wouldn’t hesitate to watch a game there…the Fish Fry on the other hand leaves much to be desired. Overall, we don’t recommend this Fish Fry and think you’d be wise to simply saunter on down the street to the Big 10 or the new Lucky’s 1313.sconniebar.com1421 Regent StreetMadison, WI 53711     (608) 819-8610",2261,0.1723758751536529,0.4870753217975438

Sure, it was a sloppy affair, but the food tasted good, and in the end that's all that really matters. On that day we had the lake perch, but knew we had to return for the AYCE cod sooner or later. Later finally rolled around...The first thing you'll notice about the AYCE at the TG is the price tag. Like most people I had sticker shock when I realized I'd be paying $20 for cod, but I thought if it was good I could at least get close to my money's worth. Unfortunately, it wasn't all that good, and the Goat got the better of me this time around. For starters, two gigantic pieces come on the first plate since apparently ""it takes a while it you order more."" So in reality they just bring you ""All You Can Eat"" on the first round which, in my opinion, this is never the way to run an AYCE since I don't want one piece sitting there getting cold and soggy while I work my way through the first one (which is exactly what happened). The best AYCE Fish Frys serve smaller pieces with a higher fish to batter ratio, and don't bring you all you can eat all at once. As far as the fish itself, it was served in long pieces - Irish Pub style, with a thick beer batter. The golden colored batter lacked flavor and oozed grease to the point where the underside of the first piece was a soggy mess about half way into piece #1 (don't even ask about piece #2). The cod itself was slick but still had some flake so it appeared to have been of decent quality at one point. Since the Goat is a BBQ joint they have a ton of sides to choose from and I settled on the house-cut fries and the mac-n-cheese. The fries were the real deal, but had an odd texture. They were kind of airy or foamy, almost like packing peanuts. I'm not sure exactly how that happens (oil too hot? too cold? not soaked long enough?) but in the end they were still decent when slathered with salt. The mac on the other hand hit most of the right notes with it's creamy consistency and better than the box flavors. NOTE: the box is available on the kid's menu so the fact they do a homemade version is a definite plus. Thickly battered fish wants, no needs, a thick tartar, but the Goat's goo was on the thin side. The average-sized cup also ran dry before I even made it though the first piece of fish and our waiter never even came back to see if we needed more so needless to say the second piece of cod merely got picked at with the bulk of it coming home in a box. Adding insult to injury was the fact that there was no bread, and while that's becoming all too common in 2018 it still doesn't make it any less disappointing. I had high hopes for the AYCE at the Thirsty Goat but unfortunately it just wasn't meant to be. The cod missed the mark as did their method of getting you all you can eat. Overall, we don't recommend this Fish Fry and will fall back on the crumbly perch if we return. thirstygoatbrew.com3040 Cahill MainMadison, WI 53711     (608) 422-5500",2993,0.07048923679060667,0.47949989128071335

Sure, I've had hundreds of great ones, lots of good ones, and plenty of lousy ones, but I've yet to find that golden goose. It's one reason I keep searching for and trying new places as often as I can...because you just never know. This Friday our quest took us to the new(ish) Thirsty Goat down Fitchburg way. The Goat is a really nice looking place, and has a really nice looking Friday Fish Fry to match. It consists of cod ($12), lake perch ($14), or All You Can Eat cod ($17). I was feeling a little fat this Friday after feasting at Toby's for lunch so I bypassed the AYCE in favor of the likely lighter lake perch. I was a little worried that the Goat would try to pass off ocean perch or European Zander as lake perch, but these fears turned out to be unfounded - this was the real deal yellow perch, no doubt about it. The small fillets were juicy and light and home to a crumbly breading with a boatload of flavor. Tons of seasoning took over the coating and harkened back to the fried chicken of a BBQ joint. The taste was tremendous, but unfortunately it just didn't stick to the slick fish at all. Huge chunks flaked off the surface leaving piles everywhere. Heaps of crumbs had to be scooped up separate from the fish and remarried on the palate. It was a bit clunky but really good when it actually stuck. There's no doubt in my mind, if they can figure out a way to make it fully adhere we'll be talking sheer excellence. Like the fish, I found their claim of house-cut fries dubious for some reason. Those misgivings we're quickly set aside when I saw the spuds. The hearty portion was a mixed-bag of sizes complete with plenty of long johns and a few stubby nubbys. They were well-fried (which is hard to do with fresh cuts) and scrumptious. I should never have doubted the Goat and applaud the effort to do it right. Their tartar also hit the mark and the cup lasted throughout the meal. It had the pop to offset the perch with no skunky aftertaste whatsoever. There was no bread, which was a bummer, but the mac-n-cheese made up for it. What's that you say? Mac-n-cheese? That's weird... It is, and I could have gone slaw (you can choose any two sides from their extensive list), but the mac sounded right. It turned out to be a sage decision as the ultra-smooth and creamy noodles soothed the bloated soul. It was rich and decadent, and really showed how boring Kraft is (we had a direct comparison too since junior got the Kraft version on the kid's menu for $6). While perfection might be impossible to achieve, I'm usually happy with excellence, and am even appeased by unique goodness. The Thirsty Goat had the goodness, and the uniqueness, and was damn close to excellence. The fish was good, and if they can somehow find a way to make that batter stick there is no doubt in my mind we'd be talking excellence. The fries, mac-n-cheese, and tartar all brought the goods and makes me think there are better days ahead. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and will be back for sure.

It's often unjustifiably crowded, they haven't ironed out the kinks with the service, and the Fish Fry hasn't hit its stride, but for some reasons even I can't fully comprehend I couldn't resist the new Verona Woods. It's partially because I didn't realize exactly how new it was (this was only there second Friday in business), but I still should have known better, or at least done some more research. When taking a toddler out for Fish Fry care should be taken in the selection of establishment and time of arrival. I must have forgotten this mantra, or perhaps my brain was just not functioning properly after an unexpectedly long Friday at work, but we sought out the Woods at 6pm with no backup plan in mind. Bad move. The shiny new toy was bubbling over with patrons and when we were quoted a hour and a half wait we had no choice but to suck it up. It wound up being every bit of that 90 minutes, but at least we found a nice spot in front of the fake fire to wait, and plenty of delicious beers from which to sample. We paid our pittance, and finally hit the dining room around 7:45. VW is owned by the some folks that own Willy Ty's in Sun Prairie, and it seems they basically just decided to mirror that Fish Fry. The 3-piece cod was eerily similar although it did seem to be way less greasy than what we had on our lone visit to the hockey arena adjacent eatery. The fish has the same reddish hue and unique flavor to the batter. Unfortunately, I was so hungry by the time it arrived I can barely remember what it tasted like as I wolfed it down, but I assure you it wasn't super amazing or anything. Just good solid cod. In that same vein flowed the fries which were really nothing special, but also got gobbled up. They were the basic Skin-on, freezer jobs, you find most anywhere, but were definitively fried for the right amount of time. Just good solid fries. A thick and mustard-y kind of tartar took up residence next to the rusty colored fish and really worked well with the kooky cod. It had plenty of pop to offset the flavor of the batter and covered up any minute imperfections in the fish itself. A crusty little piece of rye, sat meekly in the corner as if to say ""don't forget about me over here..."" While a small portion of uniquely creamy slaw got a big fancy bowl all to itself. It was an odd dichotomy and laid a little haphazardly on the plate, if I'm being honest. The critics really seem to be enjoying the slice of class that the Woods is bringing to Verona, but based on this visit I can't share the same enthusiasm as far as the Fish Fry is concerned. The saving grace for us was our waiter who was ultra-gracious, and clearly felt our pain; but that aside, the portions were pretty conservative, and everything from the fish to the slaw was just kind of average. I realize we came too early in their existence, and one lackluster performance doesn't mean we won't come back, but I'm hoping for (much) more next time around. Overall, we barely, and I do mean barely, recommend this Fish Fry, and think we'll let the dust settle before hiking into these Woods again. www.veronawoods.com958 Liberty DriveVerona, WI 53593     (608) 497-1680",3245,0.10093083755055582,0.4699185009044165

It seems like a natural fit, and a can't-miss opportunity for them, yet for some reason they just don't want to (or don't think they can) do it. The old Farm Tavern was one of those places...I say was because the NEW Farm Sports Pub is doing fish, and not just at dinner time. They've jumped in feet first with an all day affair that runs a scant $7.25 over the noon-hour. The lunch Fry at the Farm consists of a 2-piece cod or ocean perch (I emphasize the OCEAN part) with all the standard sides. Before the fried goodies, a warm roll will tumble your way, fresh from an over-sized, bar-side crock pot.  I was a little worried the fish on the Farm would be pre-battered freezer fillets, but those fears were quickly laid to rest when I saw the made-to-order masterpieces (okay masterpieces may be a stretch, but I wanted some alliteration there...so sue me). The two small pieces were maybe a few ounce each, and featured a light breading that had to be done on site. THe coating had a bit of seasoning which lent it some flavor, but not much. In addition there was a little grease seepage to deal with, and while I could have eaten a bunch more I felt the portion was adequate for lunch and the price. The most basic of basic crinkle-cut fries sit aside the fish and glistened under the afternoon sun that shone through the big windows on the side of the barn. The tartar was of the skunky variety and actually hindered the fish to some extent. While I'm not sure who the supplier is, I have my inklings as you see this stuff far to often anymore it seems. The slaw likely came from the same supplier as the sauce as it was the creamy, finely-chopped variety. While it's not bad per se, it's also not all that great.The Farm always seemed like it should be a Fish Fry joint and I'm happy to report that it finally is. While this isn't the greatest Fish Fry in the world, and they still have a few little kinks they could work out, it is what a lunch Fish Fry should be - quick, to the point, and cheap. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and will keep it on our radar as a no-nonsense option or a good place to go if we feel like hanging out with a pint or two.  www.facebook.com/pages/Farm-Tavern/1008607799582061701 Moorland RdMadison, WI 53711     (608) 221-1646",2383,0.1611543062200957,0.4592570441254652

This round I got six fillets (I think I may have gotten a bonus piece since the kitchen misplaced my order among the 6 from our table), and each was a little piece of joy. This is the real yellow perch and it's really delicious. I'm not sure what else I need to say about it at this point. The sides at the East Wash eatery are pretty basic, but take my word when I tell you, the cottage fries are a step up from crinkles (personal experience), and light years better than the au gratins (at least according to my buddy Miah). The old man's big, bold supper club tartar sauce also made it's way to Jr's establishment and really drives the perch home. Rounding out this consummate Fish Fry is plenty of soft and stanky rye and some standard supper clubby slaw. The rye had me rolling, and the slaw did it's part although it hardly lived up to the fancy plastic up it was served in. If there is one thing I know, Madison catches on to greatness quickly so I'm not sure what is taking the town so long to warm up to LJ's. I've yet to have bad fish there and am sort of dumbfounded that we get in and out unscathed each and every time. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry, and will keep coming around when we want great fish without the hassle. https://www.facebook.com/LJs-Sports-Tavern-Grill-1758815131054063/8 N Paterson StreetMadison, WI 53703",2022,0.14352585906157328,0.42879193557764983

LJ's is that Fish Fry.It should come as no surprise the LJ's has a great Fish Fry since they basically just cloned the legendary Esquire and moved it a dozen blocks or so closer to the Capitol. Like the 'squire the most popular option among the specials is the AYCE Ocean Perch, and while I have to agree it is great, this time I just had to get my gums on the $16 lake perch. For starters, the bar was surprisingly accessible despite the Madison East football game at Breese Stevens next door. There were plenty of Purgolders coming and going but that didn't prevent us getting a table right away even at the peak of the frying hour. It was a small miracle, but also spoke to how fluidly the establishment was running. We were hungry so we started things off with a shrimp cocktail and the prawns were potent. These suckers put the ""jumbo"" in jumbo shrimp and tasted fresh and fantastic. It was a surprising win and a really nice way to kick things off. The plateful of perch followed shortly after and were definitely the real deal. Seven fat fillets filled the plate with genuine flair and a crispy crust. The same breading that makes the OP so pleasurable seemingly graces the freshwater fish, and appeared to cling even better on the lake lovers. The flavors were simply fantastic, and highlighted to the utmost by the textural dichotomy drawn between the flaky fish and crunchy coating. If there is a shortcoming at LJ's it's the crinkle-cut fries, but luckily there is an alternative. The cottage fries are a step up, and the pillowy puffs of potato perfection were preferred by both dad and son alike. The typical big bold supper club tartar is also borrowed from the Esquire, and puts the perfect finishing touch on any perch it's put on. A nice basket of rye slices were doughy and hearty and a smart move by the establishment to limit the AYCErs to some degree. While the goopy, zesty, creamy coleslaw is also just what the doctor ordered. It's tough to find a flaw with this Fish Fry, and you'd expect it to be equally tough to find a table on Friday nights. We seemingly lucked out this week, but if you don't feel like taking the chance like we did, LJ's offers their superb fish EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK! It's pretty remarkable and something we'll likely take advantage of in the future. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and can't really blame Little John for taking his cues from Big John. https://www.facebook.com/LJs-Sports-Tavern-Grill-1758815131054063/8 N Paterson StreetMadison, WI 53703",2616,0.26948012736056215,0.5624952945605121

It's home to the Esquire Club's classic lightly colored breading that has just enough flavor to let you know it's there.

There are some additional options as well, like cottage fries, but even they failed to impress with their conservative portioning. The supper club lineage is evident in LJ's tartar as the mix is thick like glue and clings to the perch like nobody's business.

The slaw was the same too - ultra-goopy, incredibly creamy, with a subtle hint of horseradish that, like the rye, sets it apart. LJ did the smart thing by sticking to the Esquire's tried and true Friday formula, and I gotta imagine it's gonna work out well for them. While it's not cheap per se (at least for ocean perch) it is one of the few AYCE Fish Frys in town so the price seems justified to me.

http://madisonfishfry.com/reviews.php?restaurant=443,http://madisonfishfry.com/reviews.php?restaurant=443&event=1227,2018-01-19,Banzo (Pop-Up),"Overall, I would recommend this Fish Fry.",Excellent,Good,Good,Poor,Good,"In all honesty I'm not a huge fan of the ""pop-up"" concept. Sure, it's nice to get food at a place that doesn't always have it, but what if I really like the food and then I can't get it again since it's the pop-up has popped-down? It's a real conundrum since the places that do these pop-ups tend to have really good grub, but it's so inconsistent (to the point where it might not ever even happen again) that going there can be a bit unsatisfying. The pop-ups that Banzo has done prove the point.For starters, Banzo obviously doesn't even need to do pop-ups (the falafel business is booming these days) so the fact that they have branched out a couple times is kind of a godsend. When they do pop their fish of choice is bluegill and diners are treated to either a 3-piece for $9 or a 4-piece for $10. I of course, went for the 4-piece (which is still on the small side all things considered) and paired it with a OBBC Commuter. Banzo knows how to fry but that doesn't mean they do it quickly. We showed up just after five and the TINY dining room was overflowing not 20 minutes later, right around the time we got our orders. The fish was definitely the advertised bluegill which was coated it a flavorful and frizzy beer batter. The batter dominated the flavor profile, but that wasn't necessarily a bad thing since it was so tasty. While I would like to taste the fish at least a little, it's hard to complain about something this tasty. Whereas the fish was unique, the fries seemed surprisingly standard and came is a tiny portion (which was pretty much what I expected). In reality, I should probably have given the house made chips a whirl instead and would certainly go that route on the next pop (if indeed there is one). The house-made tartar was also intriguing, but a little heavy on the dill. In the end it was still smooth and zippy and quelled some of the frayed ends on the fish so I'll chalk it up as a win. No bread popped up in the small paper basket which was no surprise since gluten is shunned by so many in the neighborhood. The house slaw was as diverse as I've seen with tons of spice, an orange-y hue, and somewhat odd flavor. It wasn't bad per se, but I wouldn't say I craved more of it. Some ""relish"" sat on the underside of everything and the pickled veggies added a nice tang to things. These are some of the hardest Fish Frys to review since I feel like I have to ""get it while it's hot"" but in actuality they may never even happen again so reviewing it may all be for naught. Regardless, I at least get some good fish and get too see a healthier restaurant's take on the Friday tradition. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry, and will likely pop-in if it pops-up again. banzomadison.com/1511 Williamson StMadison, WI 53704     (608) 441-0012",2774,0.10145348837209305,0.5269425987449243

Known for their falafel and other Mediterranean specialties it's not exactly the kind of place that jumps to mind when you think classic Friday Fish Fry. Of course, their ""pop up"" at One Barrel isn't exactly the traditional venue either and maybe that's what makes it so intriguing? Well, that and the tasty fish they fry out back.As you might expect, Banzo's Fish Fry isn't some big blast of fried mayhem. Rather, it's a conservative portion (three or four pieces of bluegill) made with thought and care. Of course, there was no way I was about to be satisfied with three or four bluegill fillets and after sitting at the bar for a few hours beforehand I had no problem asking for a few more (to which they gladly oblige for a buck a pop). The cute little paper boat comes filled to the brim with fish, pub chips, and what they called ""relish,"" with the fish riding high atop it all. While I oft shun beer battered freshwater fish this Banzo blend had a soft texture that didn't totally bury the delicate bluegill. It was ultra-flavorful with a delectable creaminess, the dominated the overall flavor but still let the bluegill be bluegill. As far as the freshwater finsters go, the fillets were hefty which helped them to hold their own to some extent. But mostly it was about the batter which had a wonderful taste, highlighted by plenty of salt and very little grease. For a healthy"" restaurant Banzo's got deep frying on lock. As you might expect the fries were far from the normal crinkles or skin-on freezer jobs and seemed to fit right in. The pub chips were conservatively portioned, but what were there were crispy and delicious. Of course, it goes without saying that our toddlers was having one of them, but luckily for Banzo his opinion hardly factors into our rankings. Like the fish, the tartar was absolutely superb. It as thick and clingy, and really paired well with the plush beer batter. This was no Sysco sauce, and a homemade winner we'd be happy to take a jar of home. Gluten gets a bad rap these days so it doesn't surprise me that Banzo kept the savory starches off their Fish Fry altogether. They did keep the some semblance of tradition with the ""relish"" although it was an interesting take to say the least. There was a pickle or two as well as some other pickled veggies that I didn't really take note of after several Fairly Tales. Either way it all got gobbled up. While the portions were conservative, so was the price so it was a pretty fair trade off all in all. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and think it is a really cool pairing between a great little brewery and great little food cart. As long as they keep popping up, we'll keep popping in. banzomadison.com/1511 Williamson StMadison, WI 53704     (608) 441-0012",2876,0.20566311612364244,0.5720885547201334

Catfish is pretty rare in Madison with only a handful of places featuring it on their Friday menus. It stands to reason that the places that have it do so for a reason, whether it's cost, demand, or cuisine. This Friday we decided to pay Double S BBQ on Monroe Street a visit so in this case you could say it was cuisine.Double S has cod and cat on their Friday menu, but since this is  BBQ joint I had to go for the bottom feeder. Both fish come in either 2-piece or 3-piece portions and I of course went for the big $14 3-piece. In classic BBQ fashion the fish arrived piled high on a paper plate. The massive load of frydom put the Chinet to the  test and really offered that hint of southern charm. The catfish fillets were large and steaming hot, just like they should be. While catfish is mushy by nature these loins still had some flakiness. They were incredibly tender and offset nicely by a crunchy cornmeal breading. While some more Cajun seasoning would really have perked things up the overall fish/breading combination was commendable.Following in the fish's wake was what might well be the largest portion of French fries we've ever seen. It was easily four times more than came on the dinner plate we would have later that evening and at least twice as much as most other places put out. The spuds were abundant to say the least and lavishly salted to say the most. While there was really nothing unique about them per se, Double S definitely deserves an extra point or two for the sheer quantity. Maintaining the theme of abundance was a grandiose squeeze bottle of tartar. This bold sauce hit the mark and improved the fish dramatically. In addition, some salsa verde came along for the ride and while I've never seen salsa served with a Fish Fry (it's supposedly wonderful on the fish) I used most of it although I still think the tartar was better. Whereas the fish, fries, and tartar were bountiful the bread was reserved for other meals...a pickle sat in its stead. A nice slaw somehow squeezed onto the plate too and had plenty of pop to go along with its creamy texture. While most diners shy away from catfish I often opt for it if given the choice (unless I'm at Toby's, then there are just too many other amazing options). It's pretty unique in these parts, and a nice change of pace from time to time. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and think it's a great option if you're looking for something different of just looking to tackle a HUGE appetite.

Sure, Madison has its share of great fish, but there are tons of small towns within a 30 minute-ish drive and each of them have their own claims to Fish Fry fame. Stoughton is roughly a half hour cruise from our place and we'd exhausted most all their Fish Fry options until the Viking Brew Pub opened up and gave us another reason to take a drive. They say you should never judge a book by its cover and nowhere is that more true than at the VBP. The building that houses the pub is something straight out of the 60s, which is to say it's none too pretty. Luckily, the bar inside is immaculate and has the coolest fire-breathing dragon one three year old has ever seen. But enough about the Nordic ambiance, we came to eat the fish and eat we did. The Viking has cod and ""lake perch"" available on Friday, but this perch is definitely not your traditional yellow perch. ""How can you tell it's not traditional?"" you might ask. Well for starters these fillets are far too big to be yellow perch (think 6-7 inches instead of 3-5 inches). They also have a distinctively different (slicker) texture compared to the real yellow perch. More than likely they are using European Zander or Pike-Perch which many distributors sell as lake perch these days. These fillets also had a bit of a shrimpy flavor which wasn't over-the-top, but was definitely noticeable. In addition, they were a little tough to gnaw through as the batter ultra-crunchy. In fact, it was so firm it could be held in a plank-like fashion with little fear of wilting...which I guess is a plus if you're into hard core dipping. We also sampled the cod which was far superior to the perch and didn't have unwelcome aftertastes. Cod is usually more susceptible to stray flavors so I'd guess they keep one fryer bay just for the cod while the perch likely gets mixed with other seafoods. The cod had a relatively thick beer batter with a nice creamy flavor, and like i say, no shrimpiness. A small portion of well-seasoned fries sat north of the fish and held their own as best they could. A 2 oz. cup of tartar also did it's job and made the fish much better. It was thick and creamy and covered the flaws in the perch just like it needed to do. A nice little ciabatta roll improved things further, but unfortunately the same can't be said of the slaw which had a bit of a chalky taste and worst of all...craisins! Dried fruit in coleslaw. I'll never understand. Being of Norwegian decent I can fully appreciate all that Stoughton has to offer, and really liked the look and feel of the Viking and their BIG beers (a 7+ ABV works for me). The Fish Fry on the other hand was a bit of a mixed bag. While the cod did they job, the perch didn't stack up and left me longing for the genuine article. Overall, we recommend the cod, but not the perch at the Viking and might well come back again for saltwater surprise someday soon. www.vikingbrewpub.com211 E Main StreetStoughton, WI 53589     (608) 719-5041",2983,0.09101430976430976,0.5271043771043772

That's a legit Fish Fry right there.The Stockyard Grill and Saloon is a small town bar with a big time Fish Fry. The $13 3-piece comes complete with salad bar and while there is also AYCE available, I stayed conservative after having the most massive walleye fillet on modern record at the Villa Tap earlier in the day. When a salad bar is involved all things originate with roughage so lets start there. This was a great little bar and while there wasn't anything overwhelming about it the fact that it exists is awesome. There are far too few remaining salad bars in Madison and those that are around are pretty pricey. This quaint setup had most of the things you want (I'll spare you the details), but soup wasn't clam chowdah (what?). Still all the greens were fresh and, of course, you could make it as large as your heart desired (which some of my realties would gladly take advantage of). I kept it pretty conservative. The dinner rolls were also on the bar, and they were just that - dinner rolls. Onto the next... The focus of any Fish Fry should be the fish and the cod at the Stockyard was great. It was basically your standard cod with a light beer batter that really improved the flaky fish. The batter had a mild flavor that complemented the cod without trying to do too much. While my 3-piece sufficed I could easily have eaten half a dozen, and probably a lot more if not for ingesting the Moby Dick of walleye earlier in the day. Small towns restaurants often have lots of sides to choose from and the Stockyard is no exception. While I was temped by the fries I branched out and went for the hash browns with cheese and onion (and was glad I did). These spuds were slick and supreme with a great flavor meld. The supple interior was dominated by the fried onion, while the crispy edges were permeated with gooey American cheese. Any good cod is made exponentially better by a bold tartar and this sauce nearly stole the show. It had it all going on and took the fish to next level, which in our book is excellence. Living in Madison, Coon Valley isn't necessarily a destination you'd seek out, but when you're from the Driftless Area (like I am) you might find yourself in those parts on a Friday; and when you do, you'd be wise to find your way to the Stockyard.

This time was different, we couldn't venture allllll the way to Coon Valley so we hit up the VFW in Viroqua, which I'd heard had come a long way under the new management.The VF only has cod on Fridays (not surprising) and it comes as a 2 or 3-piece (also not surprising).

This bar is robust in the true Norwegian fashion - all the basics - nice greens, plenty of toppings, dressings, pasta and potato salads, plus pickled herring and chocolate mousse. The whole shebang brought me back to the great supper clubs of my childhood and this at a veterans hall. Yum. The only downfall was the soup and the bread - broccoli cheese instead of clam chowder and that tear-off style white bread. Meh. We had ample time to polish off the salad and (oh yeah) the cellophane bread sticks and cheese spread, before the fish came. It was a plain looking affair, but my god, the fries. While there were three pieces of fish on the plate, only one was visible - the rest was buried by a mountain of julienne cut fires. The fish had a bit of grease but was clean tasting, and featured a light and bubbly beer batter. The batter didn't have a lot of oomph, but the consistency was enough to keep you satisfied. The Everest of fries weren't much to speak of beyond the portion size, but were solid. However, even a fry lover, such as myself, couldn't eat them all. It was insane. Lastly came the tartar, which lived in a big squeeze bottle on the table. Unfortunately, it was a little heavy on the relish and overpowered the fish for the most part. I wound up not using it on my last piece and didn't even consider dragging a fry through it, although I normally would have with a portion of this magnitude. I grew up getting Fish at the Eagles in town so when I heard the VF had passed them up I took notice. While I haven't been to the Eagles in a while (at least for Fish) I have to imagine the rumors are true. The Fish Fry at the VF is as solid as they come and that salad bar is a force to be reckoned with. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and will probably finish off those fries sometime this week. http://myvfw.org/wi/post3032/751 S Washington AvenueViroqua, WI 54665     (608) 637-3212",2414,0.07677312997080439,0.49639585220980564

Of course, I'm not alone. Most places only have ""Perch Plate"" specials on Fridays so if you're after a Fish Fry that's probably what you're gonna do too. Fear not though, it's a good thing.I'm making a habit out of trying a different Perch Plate every Memorial Day Friday, and Perch Plate 2017 was at Fred & Fuzzy's Waterfront Bar & Grill ('cause I heard it was good). Besides the Perch Plate there is also a cheaper $13.50 Cod Plate, but when I'm in DoCo I don't feel as bad spending a full 19 beans on the perch since the setting is so idyllic (but yes, $19 is a lot). And be not fooled this is the real deal yellow lake perch and the plate looks just about as pretty as any you will find anywhere. Four full butterflies made up the fish quotient of the plate and are home to a clingy breading that would make a mama koala proud. The meat was dense and thick (likely frozen for a bit). For perch, it leaked quite a bit of grease, but that didn't ruin anything as the flavor still came through. The overall taste was good and the latent grease was sopped up by the thick tartar. A basic batch of Julienne-cut fries came in droves and were well-fried but little else. The aforementioned tartar had plenty of punch which, as mentioned, was need. This sauce was a thick as can be and clung like the dickens to the slick fish. In classic Milwaukee fashion the rye on the side was sliced in half, pre-buttered, and slapped together face-2-face. It was a memorable presentation, the same of which can't be said for the finely-chopped, but largely forgettable slaw. All in all this was a very good Fish Fry, but of course when you're in Door County pretty much everything takes a backseat to the ambiance of the Peninsula. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry, but will undoubtedly seek out a new one in 2018. www.fredandfuzzys.com/10620 Little Sister RoadSister Bay, WI 54234     920) 854-6699",1963,0.1157988980716254,0.4934710743801652

I've known about the Elias Inn for what seems like forever, but just have never been able to get to Watertown on a Friday. Luckily, today was my birthday and I laid down the law - out of town for an AYCE, and away we went...Of course, any supper club you show up at on a Friday night at 6:30 is gonna have a wait, but the bar at the Elias wasn't too crowded, and the taxidermy wasn't too grotesque (actually it was quite intriguing), so having a couple beverages while we waited wasn't a big deal. And truth be told, we didn't even wait the full hour we were quoted before sauntering into the quaint dining room for our feast. I say quaint, but the dining room at the Elias was waaaaaay smaller than expected - it was basically the same size as the bar area (no wonder there was a wait). On Fridays they scrap their normal menu, so if you don't want the AYCE fish and chicken you are SOL. The whole shebang goes for $13 and they pump it out like clockwork. As soon as you order the food starts flowing, and the first thing to hit the table is a Lazy Susan loaded with: Asian-style slaw (sesame flavor and Ramen noodles in it), regular potato salad (cool and dilly, would be right at home on a picnic blanket), German potato salad (warm and sweet, but not for me), baked beans (Bush's would be proud), breads (regular and pump rye, both of which were stellar), and tartar (more on that later). It was almost too much for one man to eat (my wife decided to opt out), but I did my best....truth be told I crushed it all except for that German fella. The fish basically came at the same time as the Lazy Susan and if the waitress had three hands I believe she'd have brought it all at once. Four nice pieces of BBC (Beer Battered Cod) came on the first round and were moist and flaky. It was cod, so it was basic, but home to a beer batter that was light and crispy with a nice flavor. While all was in order this cod simply exploded when married with the homemade tartar. While I can't be sure what was in the sauce it was perhaps the best I've ever had. It was thick as anything I've seen and had a sweetness that I couldn't put my finger on. It was delectable and twisted the cod in new directions the likes of which are unrivaled in my (vast) experience. This benevolent sauce took the cod from tactful to transcendence and resulted in a flavor combo for the ages. Three more pieces of cod got crushed on round two and by the time all was said and done I could barely move...and was better for it. In addition to the two potato salads on the Lazy Susan, some battered fries came along as well. This is a potato poppers paradise. These crunchy spuds had a delightful orange hue and pillowy soft interiors. They mimicked the fish to some extent and my handful was gone just before the second round of fish hit the table. While I considered asking for more I had plenty of PS of the LS to suffice. While I've never had a Fish Fry in Watertown before I have to assume the Elias is THE place to go come Friday. This was an outstanding Fry and one I'd definitely consider making the drive for again. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and think well stop in at the Inn again soon.   www.facebook.com/pages/Elias-Inn-Supper-Club/116392781717675200 N 2nd StreetWatertown, WI 53094     (920) 261-6262",3388,0.13878569242205607,0.4661973716519171

The Bear's sister restaurants - The Free House, The Waypoint, and the The Flying Hound - have all struck a chord with Madisonites with their chic ambiance, vast beer selections, and modern take on comfort foods The North Side incarnation is seemingly destined for greatness since she shares all those same qualities. It also stands to reason B&B would know a thing or two about Fish Fry since the others have it down for the most part. Unfortunately, it wasn't meant to be.Now, not all the sister's fry fish all that well. The Waypoint and Flying Hound certainty do it up right, but some how the Fry at the Free House falls flat. I'm not sure if B&B stole the FH's recipes or what, but what I do know is that the cod pales in comparison to that at the 'point or the Hound. The Friday specials look like this: fried cod for $12, $13 for a grilled rendition of the saline swimmer, $16 for fried walleye, or $17 for a grilled version of the freshwater finster. We stuck to the standard fried cod on our maiden voyage and went with all the standard accompaniments (save for the bread of which there was none). Let's start things off with a discussion about the cod. The incarnation was lightly battered but basically had no flavor. This tends to happen at new places that are trying not to offend anyone straight away. They are seemingly unwilling to take a chance with the salt shaker and therefor wind up under-seasoning and giving you a bland piece of fish where all you can taste is the cod itself. The 3-pieces also got super saturated, but not by grease... The soupy slaw was the culprit here, as the juicy junk just wouldn't stop oozing. Sharing the plate, and shouldering a good amount of the load, were a hefty handful of shoestring style fries. These babies were done well, but like the fish fell victim to the leaky slaw. A thin and gritty tartar was spared the wrath of the cabbage born beast as it had a Solo boat to float in. Like the fries, it was actually quite tasty with enough pop that it improved the fish about 100 fold. Since there was no bread the last thing to mention was the slaw, and as you may have guessed by now it was none too good. In addition to the fact it couldn't keep it's hands to itself, it had an odd seasoning that just tasted weird. While I like pep, this was more pungent (like someone dumped a half a cup of Old Bay in it) and way off balance. We live on the North Side and welcome any new places to this side of town, especially ones geared towards a younger, more affluent crowd. We have no doubt that Bear and Bottle will continue to be a destination for Northsiders, but unless some dramatic changes are made to their Fish Fry we probably won't be back on a Friday any time soon. Overall, we don't recommend this Fish Fry, but think the place itself is great and we're holding out hope that as the cub grows this Fry will turn into a real bear. www.bearandbottlewi.com601 N Sherman AvenueMadison, WI 53704     (608) 630-8800",3040,0.14309443642776973,0.49124258457591785

Well, I do have a couple nice things to say...unfortunately the bulk of it is not so rosy.Hail Mary is a sports bar in an old church. If that sounds strange, you're right, it is. Still, even with that odd dichotomy if the food were amazing all sins would be forgiven - substance over style. Hail Mary serves cod and perch on Friday, both of which are beer battered, and since the good Lord frowns on beer battered freshwater fish I went for the cod. The 3-piece is hearty, I'll give them that, but runs $14 which is getting up there price-wise. There are seven deadly sins, and I think this cod committed them all. It was likely the blandest I have ever tasted. In fact, I'm not sure ""tasted"" is even the right word since there was essentially no flavor whatsoever, save for a faint essence of beer. The breading was thick and doughy, with a lack of seasoning like I've never seen before. The fish itself scalded me with grease on more than one occasion as it shot out the back end and on to my Pius fingers. Ouch and uck. The crispy, beer battered fries were a blessing in an otherwise bleak scene, and along with the marble rye were the saving grace of the meal. The same can not be said for the middling tartar or the creamy, yet forgettable slaw. Jesus loves me, this I know, but I'd bet even he wouldn't love this Fish Fry. It was just not good in any way, and while I feel bad crucifying the Hail Mary, there just really isn't any way around it. Overall, we don't recommend this Fish Fry and think they need to make some changes quickly if they want to stick around in Madison's crowded food scene. www.hailmarymadison.com/401 East Washington AvenueMadison, WI 53703     (608) 467-3016",1757,0.036067019400352736,0.5356554967666077

Clearly Regent Street is going to be off-limits and most places in the Near West/Downtown area are going to be tough, if not impossible, to get into. We had friends in town who were going to the game, but still wanted to get fish with us beforehand. I weighed the options: try to get close to the stadium and risk either no fish or long waits, or be willing to walk a little way and have a better chance of actually getting food and them still making kickoff. I settled on the the Side Door since I knew it was close enough for them to make the walk to Camp Randall, but far enough to keep the crowds at bay.Truth be told, I also wanted to revisit the Side Door since our second visit had been a big step down from our first and I wanted to see which was the true Fry. This was the rubber match as it were, and I must say it settled in the solid, but not stellar section. For starters, I couldn't bring myself to go for the AYCE since I knew I'd be imbibing throughout the course of the evening, so I settled on the 2-piece. Like our most recent visit the cod was a bit of a mixed bag. The pieces were oddly shaped and had a few brownish flakes of meat here and there (not the best trim job). They were caked in the crumbly (yes I said crumbly) beer batter that held tight at times, but sloughed off at others. Overall, it had a fine flavor, but wasn't really a keep-you-coming-back-for-more kind of fish. All told, I was happy with my decision to stay away from the All You Can Eat. The Door is known for their tots, but unfortunately you can't get them as a side with the fish. These massive potato cylinders only come as a stand alone appetizer and between the eight of us at the table we sampled all four varieties. Each was admirable in their own way, but for me the Volcano and the South of the Borders stood out from the Bake Potater and Roasted Garlic varieties. The fries that do come with the fish merely live in the shadow of the tremendous tots, although for mass produced freezer fries they were well seasoned and about as good as you can do. The tartar was on the thin side, but still had some zip, while the homemade slaw was colorful as all get-out and brought a zing as well. The last bit was a crusty little dinner roll that was step up from the basic bun and rounded things out in fine form. While the Side Door has slid into the B/B- range as far a Fish Fry in concerned I still think I made the right choice this Friday. We all got our fill of fish without breaking the bank and were still able to get a couple beers on Regent in before kickoff. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and think it's a fine, and relatively unknown, alternative to some of the more publicized game day spots downtown. thesidedoorgrill.com/240 W Gilman StreetMadison, WI 53703     (608) 310-4800",2917,0.12379306852991064,0.49032302979671405

Whether it's a car, a new pair of shoes, a Thomas train (we have a three year old), or even a Fish Fry, new things seem more exciting. Our first trip to the Side Door had us seeing stars. It was fresh, it was AYCE, and it seemed destined to become a classic. Fast forward a couple weeks and the polish has worn off the apple and the Fish Fry, while still AYCE, didn't seem quite so exciting.If nothing else, $13 for All You Can Eat fish is a a solid deal, and one you could really take advantage of if you're into that sort of thing (they also have $10 AYCE fish tacos if you swing that way as well). The fish this go-round was suspect as the first of our three pieces was very chewy and the meat very dark. It was also abused by an absurdly thick beer batter that left nothing to the imagination. Pieces two and three (the later of which was ordered on the re-up) were whiter, but still pretty mushy. It seemed like they all had been frozen for quite some time. While we love French fries they can get pretty monotonous, so if an equally great option presents itself we are tending to go that direction. I'd heard the homemade tater tots at SD were to die for so I figured I'd test those waters. It. Was. Not. A. Mistake. These massive tater tubes were loaded with an oniony essence that was reminiscent of a good potato pancake. There was a lot going on here, from the crispy skin to the plush innards. While most would expect tots to be Ore-ida style shreds that get glued back together, these honeys are mealy, consistent, and smooth. A relatively thick and tartar came with the fish and covered up some of its imperfections, but in reality it could only do so much. The raw tasting slaw also didn't do the Fry and flavors as it just felt incomplete. The dense, baseball-esque roll was intense and if you're wise you'd take it home and not waste the belly space at this AYCE. I want every Fish Fry I eat to be the best, and while our first visit had us believing that might be the case, we're rethinking that notion after this round. There was still a lot to like - mostly those tots, but everything else digressed. Overall, we still recommend this Fish Fry although just barely.

I mean, it's meat served from a sword so naturally word gets around about that sort of thing...but what is less publicised is the bar below the Brazilian themed hot spot. Truth be told, I also had no idea there was a restaurant under there, and judging from the number of patrons present at noon of Friday no one else does either. Maybe they should...Apparently the bar has historically been more of an offshoot of Samba - a place to sit and wait for a table with a similar vibe to that of the sword weilding servers spot overhead. Recently they have reformatted (or so I've been led to believe) and while they still share a kitchen with the ethnic eatery, that is about where the similarities end. The ""new"" Side Door Grill & Tap is decidedly American in ambiance and food which is right up may alley (not that boatloads of cooked meat isn't per se). And what's especially American is their AYCE Fish Fry special on Friday. I recently talked at length about the virtues of the AYCE and lamented the lack of them available in 2017. Well, Side Door is here to help fill the void with a full AYCE cod Fry for a scant $13. Clearly some thought and care went into the preparation of this Fish Fry and it starts with the batter. While the coating was on the thick side it had plenty of seasoning and didn't get gummy. The flavor shone bright and offset the somewhat spotty (there were a few brownish areas here and there) fish well . I ate three roughly 3 oz. pieces in house, but couldn't finish the fourth and was allowed to take it home although at most All You Can Eats that's a no-no (shhhhh don't tell the cooks). Sitting alongside the cod were some shoestring style French fries which were well prepared. They were crispy on the outside, but still supple on the inside which is a hallmark of frying mastery. Next on the docket was a zippy tartar that offset the cod well with it's bold flavors. The creamy cod soaked it up like a sponge and the tartar loved being wanted so emphatically. It was a beautiful relationship and one we'd love to be the third wheel in again. A dense dinner roll came with the fish and was easily as heavy as a baseball. It was nuts, and I could likely have knocked someone out cold with this thing. It was literally like nothing I have ever seen before, and although it did taste pretty good it's not what I'm after at an AYCE when I want to fill up on fish. A sweet and sassy slaw came in last and while it did the job it was not one to write home to mom about. Any sort of new Fish Fry in Madison makes our ears perk up, but a new AYCE is a while different story. The second we knew of its existence we knew we needed to make it ours, and we did...and we're glad we did. Very glad indeed. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and are thinking we need to come back for dinner and totally invest in the AYCE.

I mean, you have Fish Fry - great, and you have movies - amazing. How can putting those things together possibly fail? It seriously doesn't seem possible, but the Catch and Reel at Breese Stevens is a total flop.Obviously, I think the concept of C&R is great, but Fish Fry is 100% about execution, and man, balls were dropped all over on this one. For starters, I knew we were in trouble as soon as we got in and I saw the heat lamps under the tent. Unfortunately, we were already committed to the evening so I was hoping my gut was wrong...of course, the only thing wrong turned out to be what went in it. C&R has cod and bluegill available as well as very expensive beers (I'm talking $6 Bud Lights), and since I was feeling brash I went for the $14 bluegill (I could also see the cod was just pre-battered fillets so I was hoping for something at least half way fresh). As you can probably guess, they were seemingly expecting an army to show up so they set to frying the fish well in advance. Of course, experience would tell you that as long as the oil is hot you could fry to order no problem (especially with the amount of people actually ordering and the number of fryers they had), but experience was not on their side. As it stood, our order sat under those lamps for god knows how long and the fillets were stiff and cold by the time we got them. It was absolutely god awful. I'm not exaggerating when I say it was probably the worst fish I've ever had, and for $14 I felt sick to my stomach. Even lukewarm would have been a luxury and the hard fish and mushy breading had me calling it quits less than half way through. There were simply no redeeming qualities to the fish and while I know they want to be prepared for an onslaught, this was ridiculous. The fryers were right there, and they could have easily met demand by frying fish on an as-ordered basis. Even with the fryers present there were no fries to be found and the potato salad that sat in looked every bit as bad as it tasted (which went ditto for the coleslaw). It was a mess. Dragging things down even further was the packets of Kraft tartar. This stuff is the definition of a pre-sealed nightmare, and sealed the deal on this rotten meal. The roll wound up being the best part of the Fry and even that tasted like it hadn't been fresh for the better part of a week. While Blues Brothers on the (surprisingly tiny) screen remains a classic, the only blues I had were thanks to the abysmal Fish Fry. The smart thing to do would have been to stop at LJ's across the street before and fill up there then head over for the movie after, but alas we weren't smart this week...if we ever attempt it again, that's what we'll do. Overall, we don't recommend this Fish Fry, and in fact, if we had such a rating I'd say it was highly not recommended.

Hell, this ain't even La Crosse. This is rural Wisconsin, and while there may not be big city panache, or 20 things going on Friday night, there is still a supper club around. This club is called Castle Hill, and it's a big old place with a big old Fish Fry.From what I can tell, most visitors to Castle Hill on a Friday stick to the AYCE seafood buffet, and I can see the reasoning - there is a lot of stuff there. Unfortunately, experience has taught me that buffets can be hit and miss depending on how much fish is fried and how long it has sat there, so if the option exists for a fresh fried plate from the kitchen I always go that route. Luckily for me CHSC has that option (and it still comes with a romp through their salad bar). This bar is impressive so lets start there. It starts with all the usual suspects - greens, salads, and toppings (all of which were fresh and inviting) and tacked on a few unique items like vanilla pudding. On the end was a bread carving station and a crock full of chicken noodle soup...I know, it should have been clam chowder, but what are you gonna do... I loaded up a plate and bowl and took them to task and was allowed ample time to finish them before my plate of scalding hot cod arrived. The non-AYCE at the Castle is a $12 3-piece affair. The cod is commonplace but the light beer batter that bubbles from its surface is what really drew the attention. While it could use more seasoning, and seeped a bit of grease it was nothing I couldn't handle. It was your typical Wisconsin cod, and while it was nothing special there was nothing wrong with it either. A boatload of crispy battered shoestring style fries rode shotgun and lasted until the fish was gone. The had a big crunch and offset the creamy cod commendably. They also paired equally well with the thick and creamy tartar and its supper club zing. Castle Hill isn't the fanciest Fish Fry you are going to find, but it checks all the standard boxes and adds on salad bar to boot.

We've been traveling that way to get back to our hometown since 19 has been closed and the second we rounded that corner I could see it glowing like a beacon in distance saying: ""Come here, eat fish, we love you...and so forth"" Like most crossroads style taverns, Pape's is misleadingly tiny on the inside with only about a dozen barstools and half as many high top tables. Thankfully the weather was perfect this Friday and their patio is gigantic so we just ordered at the bar and grabbed a spot out there. Pape's has a 2-piece haddock for $9, a 3-piece for $11, and a $13 ""perch"" all of which are available baked or fried. Being the sucker I am I went for the perch full knowing that one of my companions wouldn't come close to eating his full 2-piece. Predictably, the fried haddock was the best of the bunch, although the perch was not without its charms. A light breading was shared by all the fried fish with portions of it flaking off here and there. The haddock loins were meaty, probably around 3 oz. each with a nice white flake - the breading worked particularly well here. The perch was different all around. From feel to flavor it had me guessing from start to finish. First off, there were only four fillets and they were very long and thin, like suspiciously long... They weren't Zander-like (not long or thick enough), so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt, but I'm still kind of skeptical. A big, bold tartar with an eye-popping flavor paired well with the both styles of flaky fish and held its own against the fries (which were the highlight of the meal). A strong slaw with plenty of zip played a tertiary part, while the basic dinner roll brought up the rear. Now that we've expounded on the virtues of the fish and other sides let's talk about the star of the show, the king of the castle, the cock of the rock - the house-cut French fries. Pape's has several options including baked potatoes, and waffle fries, but if you like real fries these are what you're after. These fat cuts are fried to perfection and sprinkled with plenty of coarse salt making for the full flavor profile. These rival the best we've had and are worth going out of the way for all on their own. Country bars just have some sort of hold on me and when they are as welcoming as Pape's and have a good food they're even more intriguing.

Regardless of how much you try to talk yourself into thinking something could or should be good, deep down you just know otherwise. I really hoped the Wisconsin Fish Fry (on the everyday menu) at The Post might actually be worth the $15 price tag, but of course, I couldn't help but think: ""this place used the be Jerome's.""For those who don't know, Jerome's (now The Post) was/is the lobby bar & restaurant on the ground floor of the Best Western on The Square. As someone who frequents Genna's, Jerome's was always kind of an inside joke. The bar was always empty, and seemingly justifiably so, but I can honestly say I was hopefully The Post (and their swanky remodel) would turn those jokes on their head. Unfortunately, I can't say that's the case...at least not totally. The post-Jerome's ambiance is surprisingly chic, but the food still missed the mark for the most part. Apparently the $15 ""regular"" portion of cod is only a 2-piece affair because we asked for an extra piece for the little man and still only got 3 total. While the pieces were small (maybe a couple ounces each) they were actually commendable as each was light and flaky albeit a bit greasy. The wayward oil slicked the surface, but wasn't abundant enough to pool on the plate (or rather the lettuce that it rode in on). The breading had a nice seasoning (the same of which is seemingly shared by the fries) and, parsley or some such nonsense sprinkled on it. By and large it was acceptable, but the puny portion had me hoping Jr. didn't want his piece. Of course, this time he ate it all.The highlight of any Fish Fry should be the fish, but The Post's tartar stole this show. The swanky sauce was clearly made in-house, had all sorts of things going on, and all of them seemed to work. It started with just the right ratio of dill, and finished with what seemed to be curry or turmeric. It was really excellent and made the grease on the fish an afterthought. Truly great stuff. If nothing else, The Post is trying to look the part of a fine dining establishment, so I'm surprised that they fall back on crinkle-cut fries. Of course, they at least attempted to soup them up with some seasoning, but the portion was nothing short of laughable. A house-made slaw was unique and had a mellow flavor and smooth consistency drawing things closer to recommendable, but of course, there was no bread with this $15 Fry which put the kibosh on that thought. I'm not sure why I'm surprised. I try to be a glass-half-full kinda guy, and I wanted this Fish Fry to be good, but it just didn't quite cut the mustard. The fish has potential, and the tartar and slaw did their job, but the cookie cutter fries and lack of bread sank the proverbial ship. Overall, we don't recommend this Fish Fry and will probably just stick to drinking at Genna's when we're on West Main. thepostmadison.com/24 S Carroll StreetMadison, WI 53703     (608) 327-1101",2935,0.1640250544662309,0.541385357561828

Mine had eating Fish Fry at the Wayside Inn at the top of it. I guess you can check that baby off!I've known about the Wayside for about a decade, but you don't just take the 45 minute drive to Jefferson on a whim - you prioritize, you plan, you wait 10 years, then when the timing is juuuuust right, you pounce (at least that the story I'm going with). Truth be told, I just had a free Friday afternoon and felt like taking the drive for what I'd heard was the ""best Fish Fry in Jefferson County"". I'd say it was worth it. The 'side has lots of choices on Fridays (cod, lake perch, bluegill, catfish, shrimp, scallops, lobster, and frog legs), but I settled on the ""Lg"" perch for $13.50 which was 100% as advertised. Large is an understatement as 9 fillets of real yellow perch were piled all over the plate and paired with a tissue paper thin breading that was simply outstanding. Each fillet was soft and plush with just enough flavor to let you know what's what without any overtly fishy flavors. For $13.50 you can't ask for much more. Usually when there are a ton of fish to choose from the sides follow suit and the Wayside did not disappoint in that regard. There were too many to list (or even remember for that matter), but as soon as I heard ""hash browns"" muttered I knew what I was going with. These babies were top notch and the portion was massive. They came covered with a boatload of coarsely chopped onion and a couple slices of melted American cheese just like they should. They were excellent in every sense of the word. The Wayside is essentially a supper club and as such you'd expect a supper club style tartar and, of course, they deliver. This big, bold blend clung to the fish with reckless abandon and provided the pop you expect. The pre-buttered marble rye also did exactly what it was supposed to do by adding flavors that would have otherwise been absent. And of course, before any of this went down a runny, but zippy slaw started things off right. While I'm not necessarily a bucket list kind of guy I do keep a ""Fish Finder"" of places that I know I want to get to someday and its nice to check one of them off from time to time. The Wayside definitely lived up to its billing as one of the best and we'll likely take the trip down that way way again some sunny day. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and can die a little happier knowing that we've been there and done that. www.facebook.com/jeffersonwi/W4820 US-18Jefferson, WI 53549     (920) 674-6766",2602,0.20606411862990806,0.5107748538011696

On Friday nights Angelo's morphs into a full-fledged Fish Fry joint, and while there are still plenty of Italian specialties available before the weekend strikes the wisest among us know to find specials section on the menu. There are lots of alluring options here, and after enjoying the bluegill on our last visit I felt compelled to branch out with the cod. The 3-piece runs a cool $13.50 and the 'lo will let you tack on additional pieces for $3 a pop. I was feeling hungry (and figured if nothing else I'd take piece home) so I ponied up for a 4-piece. In true Italian antipasto style the slaw, a basket of bread, and a mini relish tray show up before the entree and definitely start things off right. The slaw was a bit basic, the basket of warmish bread was a step above the norm, and the mini relish tray was fresh and inviting - carrots, celery, and radishes for the win! As you might expect the 4-piece was a bountiful beast. While the standard 3-piece would be more than enough for most patrons the fourth was more than welcome in my famished belly...as you could probably guess it didn't make it to a to-go box as planned. This cod was extremely tasty, with a flaky Wilson's-esque breading. It had plenty of seasoning and literally not a drop of grease to speak of. The plate was left bone dry, yet the fish was moist. It was incredibly commendable and invariably satisfying. I can't be certain, but I'm pretty sure there is no French fry option at A-Mc but with the cheesy hash brown casserole they don't need one. This lovely loaf comes with with a crunchy topping that's nothing short of superb, and an onion-y essence that lets you know it was there without taking over the show. It's the default option with the fish and I can definitely see why. Rounding out this Fry was a thick and rich tartar which, like the fish, was basically a Wilson's clone. It canoodled with the cod and was essentially a match made in heaven. Being that Angelo's is Italian cuisine is a Madison area staple you might expect them to phone their Fish Fry in, but that's definitely not the case. Every bit of it is done right from the perfectly fried fish to the unexpected relish tray. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry think that it's definitely amore! www.angelosrestaurants.com/4706 Farwell StreetMcFarland, WI 53558     (608) 838-2233",2480,0.2314690982776089,0.49868963188112125

For starters, I'd heard really good things about Angelo's new spot in McFrland and thought, ""hell, it's a pizza joint, if we go early we should breeze right through..."" That logic was flawed to say the least. When we showed up at 5:30 the parking lot was packed - like overflowing into the Culver's lot next door packed, and my heart sank a little. We had not one, but two toddlers in our party of five today, and this place is tiny so I knew we'd be waiting, and wait we did.It seemed like 90% of the tables were two-tops and despite the fact we got on the list we saw several parties of two come and go before we finally made our way to our spot at the outdoor patio. It was well over an hour wait, which if you're on 3 year old time, is an eternity. We were already frazzled by the time the cordial, yet absentminded waitress came around, but relieved to see the bountiful options on the Friday menu - from cod, to walleye, and mahi mahi to bluegill there was something for everyone. I went for the 'gill and got to sample the cod as well as the mahi mahi. 8 or so fillets in varying sizes were scattered across the plate and looked pretty unimpressive. Despite the underwhelming presentation they were actually quite enticing, with a nice light breading and slightly fishy flavor. Each had a good snap and while it clearly sat for a few minutes after exiting the oil it was still adequately hot. The cod had the same breading and was hotter than hell and boy does that ever make a difference. The loins were nice and flaky and had a pleasant flavor thanks in part to the fact it was freshly fried. A-Mc has a few sides to choose from but if you don't specify otherwise cheesy hash brown casserole is the default. It's a nice puffy pile of spuds although I'd say only marginally better than the skin-on freezer fry alternative. A no nonsense tartar was thick and zesty with no dilly downfalls. Thankfully, we don't see much of that dilly madness these days which is a blessing. A basket of French bread slices (or maybe they were Italian? that would make more sense) were abundant and seemed reasonably fresh. A soupy slaw didn't draw our attention, but didn't make us sick either. We loved Jolly Bob's and were sad to see it go, but apparently the cooks from old JB's are manning the grills and fryers at Angelo's now and it shows. The food is certainly commendable and you can see the Jamaican influence in the mahi mahi and some of the other dishes. Thankfully, these guys can do the traditional Wisconsin Fish Fry too which explains why McFarland is apparently cuckoo these Cocoa Puffs. Overall, we still recommend this Fish Fry despite the excruciating wait to get it, and maybe we'll try it again some time if we can get there by 4:00 or don't have two toddlers in tow. www.angelosrestaurants.com/4706 Farwell StreetMcFarland, WI 53558     (608) 838-2233",2907,0.11617176226551224,0.503343704906205

Well, the answer is pretty simple really - I'm always on the hunt for the perfect Fry and there is a good chance that it's not within the city limits. That's just a fact of the matter, and since I'd heard the Sunset Bar & Grill was a contender for that crown I took yet another road trip.There's no shortage of places slinging Friday specials on the shores of Lake Koshkonung and rumor has it the Sunset is the best among them (which is saying something since Norm's Hideaway is down there and they know a thing or two about Friday Fish). While it took me a few months to find a Friday where I had time to drive to rural Fort Atkinson I eventaully did and was slightly dismayed to see that there was only one other patron in house during the lunchhour. Apparently folks don't show up at the Sunset for lunch, but regardless, they had cod (3-piece for $9 or 5-piece for $11) and walleye (1-piece for $16) on special so I pulled up and ordered my 5-piece and a Moon Man. Sun and Moon, I guess I felt maybe the stars were aligning just for me... Being that it was basically just the bartender and I, my plate showed up quickly, I mean, what else was did the cook have to do? While five may seem like a lot for lunch, these were more like nuggets than real pieces so if you have any sort of appetite I'd recommend the fiver - I can't imagine the 3-piece would do much for anyone. They also have some sort of parmesean dusting thing going on that is pretty popular, but I figured I'd stick to the standard on my maiden voyage. The plate showed up and the first thing I noticed was the amount of platic on it (none of which was the tartar). Since I got the potato pancakes there were cups of maple syrup and apple sauce to go along with the usual cup of coleslaw. There was also a cup of drawn butter...I know right, drawn butter with fried fish? It seemed odd to me, but maybe that's the way they swing down on the lake? Who am I to judge? The tartar came in a chilled squeeze bottle so at least a Solo was spared there. The cod was made to order and had a light beer batter. The meat was already rich and buttery so the drawn butter on the side seemeed like overkill to me, but to each their own. A sheen of oil glistened on the surface of the flaky little nuggets, magnified by the midday sunlight that pierced through the bar's westerly-facing windows. The surficial sheen stayed away from the nugget's flaky interiors resulting in a pleasent rendition that got gobbled up with little hesitation. The closer you get to Milwaukee the more likely you are to find potato pancakes, and the Sunset slayed the traditional side. Two large flapjacks featured cripy edges and fell apart readdily when cut. They crumbled when married to the syrup or sauce, but were simply superb with either. I could easily have eated 6 more of these babies. Squeeze bottles of tartar are great as long as they are kept cool, and this thick mix clung to the nuggets slick surface in spite of the oil. It was a big, bold blend that took charge and put the quintent in check. A chalky slaw couldn't keep pace with its platemates with its odd flavor and cottage cheese-like consistency, while a couple fat slices of pre-buttered rye were slapped face 2 face in true Milwaukee fashion. Rye may have fallen out of favor for most, but I still like the diversity it adds to the Fry. Lake Koshkonung is a long way to go for a Fish Fry, but if it's the best you'll ever have then it's well worth it. While this was a good Fish Fry, I wouldn't say it was that great, although the tiki bar out back did look like it would be a good time on a warm summer Saturday night. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry, but can't say it's quite the perfection we are seeking. www.sunsetbaronthelake.comW7905 High Ridge RoadFort Atkinson, WI 53538     (920) 563-5702",3950,0.24416788766788766,0.502443833943834

Everything about it was out of this world and I left fish drunk and loving every second. I knew I needed to come back, despite the lengthy drive into the country, and found a Friday where I happened to be out that way. I showed up before 5:00 and the family joined me about an hour or so later (when the place was jumpin').The Club has a lot of fish options on Friday nights which for me starts and (basically) ends with the $17 lake perch or bluegill. There's also cod for $12 or $13 (depending on size) and walleye for $17 (which are available on the everyday menu). There's also a TON of other fishy friends on Fridays like shrimp and scallops. All the entrees come with their impressive salad bar which contains all the usual salad bar suspects save for clam chowder - today it was cheesy veg and French onion instead!? This is a fine Sysco salad bar and come complete with some superb rolls that are kissed with a brush of drawn butter. Since I'd bit the bluegill on the first visit i decided to peruse the perch this time and the portion was comprised of four fat fillets. These were some real honkers which had me wondering if they were pike-perch or some sort of farm-raised mutants. It said nothing of Canadian waters on the menu (as the walleye did) so I presume that was the case. The meat looked the part - flaky with the waffle-like pattern, so I presume it was the genuine article. Rather than a breading this perch comes cloaked in a light beer batter, that is more grease-prone than your typical dry breading. A bit of the oil remained in the fish and needed to be licked off the finger tips from time to time. It wasn't a problem by any means, but was certainly notable. Overall, it was good, but not great. The typical supper club side options abound outside Columbus and I stuck to the ubiquitous fries. This rendition was battered up and crispy, but Sysco through and through underneath. Don't get me wrong, they were still very good, but the kid's assortment was much better as he got lots of nice long cuts where my portion was nub-filled. A smattering of a superb tartar left its mark, and was as thick as glue and just as sticky. The perch loved every ooey gooey dollop and the combo made it possible to get down every last bite despite being fulled beyond capacity dues to the bowl of heavily-salted popcorn I'd enjoyed at the bar while waiting. Our first visit to Club 60 had me thinking this might be not only one of the best Fish Frys in the area, but in the entire state. After this second stop we definitely need to pump the brakes a little on that overly-enthusiastic outlook. Yes, this is a very good Fish Fry, but there are clearly some other major players in that game and this one doesn't quite reach those lofty heights. Overall, we still recommend this Fish Fry, and think the hour + round trip to get your hands on it is still justified. www.club60supperclub.com2164 State Rd 60Columbus, WI 53925     (920) 623-3113",3042,0.15857815442561207,0.4847269303201506

I'd heard a lot of good things about their Fish Fry, and figured this might be my only chance to see what all the fuss was about. I took the jaunt up 51 past DeForest, hung the right on Highway 60 East, and eventually landed at the Club around 8pm. Since it was ""late"" I figured I'd saunter right in, grab a quick bite, and slip out like a thief in the night. This was a (gross) miscalculation on my part...The place. Was. Slammed. Despite it being 8 o'clock, I had a roughly 30 minute wait at the bar and saw numerous people arrive and put their name on the list after I did. I'd have to say, Club 60 is THE place to be on a Friday night in Columbus, and it's probably not particularly close.While Club 60 has the typical supper club fare it definitely doesn't feature your typical supper club ambiance. It's more like a big well-lit banquet hall with high ceilings and white walls as opposed to the dark wood paneling and dim lighting you might be accustomed to. When the time came I was mercifully seated in a back corner which allowed me to get a pretty good lay of the land. Ambiance is one thing, but for me the most important part of a Fish Fry is the fish and Club 60 has it in spades (check their facebook page if you want to see all the nightly specials). It was a tough call, but I settled on the $17 bluegill which includes a romp through the salad bar (strike $2 from the bill of you want to skip the romp - but believe me you don't). This is a classic salad bar like those of my youth. It kicked off with a fresh lettuce mix which was followed by and all the standard toppings - eggs, shredded cheese, bacon bits, croutons, a quartet of dressings, coleslaw, pasta salad, and on and on. Not to mention there were a couple pots of soup on the end. I loaded up plateful, and grabbed a cup of the seafood chowder and gleefully glided back to my corner. The salads all turned out to be satisfactory (creamy coleslaw included) and while the chowder definitely tasted of seafood, I don't think I bit into a single meaty chunk, and believe me I was scouring the bottom of the crock with that ladle. Oh well, by 8:30 that kind of thing is to be expected and after all I wasn't really here for the soup... Even at such a late hour there had to be a good 75 people in the dining room, but despite those numbers my food came in a flash - like before my salad was even gone fast. The bluegill definitely looked the part and had the taste to match. The seven fillets had a thin, light yellow breading that was like a whisper on its skin. It had the perfect flavor and texture - no elasticity, slightly chewy, and barely fishy. It was a superb rendition and exactly what you are hoping for when you order bluegill. There were a handful of potato options including German potato salad, but the fries sounded right tonight. Club 60's versions are basic freezer fries, but they take them a step further with a crispy batter. There was also no shortage of these plumpers on the plate and while I'll take house-cut fries any day, this is about as well as a freezer fry can be done. Any supper club Fish Fry should come with a supper club style tartar and this one was spot on. Not one, but two cups came with the fish and had a consistency just short of wet cement. It was so thick and so clingy, that once attached to the batter there was no shaking it. I'm not sure exactly what it was that made it different but there was definitely a little something extra in it. It had a noticeably yellow hue as opposed to the stark white sauces you so often see and was simply superb. The rolls were on the salad bar and weren't grandma style - they had a little grit to them - but really weren't anything special. Don't get me wrong, Club 60 is a bit of a drive, but if you're like me and you are constantly looking for the best of the best it's a drive worth taking. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and are already thinking of excuses to get back there ASAP. This Fish Fry is not to be missed. www.club60supperclub.com2164 State Rd 60Columbus, WI 53925     (920) 623-3113",4395,0.12456499899537875,0.44711395496205625

Hell, most of you probably don't even know where Chaseburg is, more or less plan on going there on a Friday, but if for some reason you do here's a little else something for you to digest.The Hideaway is a great little small town bar (I emphasize small) with a really nice little Fish Fry. Cod and walleye are served on Friday nights, and both at very reasonable prices - $9.25 for cod (extra pieces for a buck and a quarter  pop) and a few shillings more for the walleye. There is also a walleye cheeks app available and you know we couldn't pass that up. The tender cheeks were buried under a thick beer batter such that the thin meat was totally lost, but it was still cool to see and got things rolling. A kooky kind of salad bar also comes with the fish and featured some cold salads, but no lettuce of any sort. There was a broccoli salad, a macaroni salad, some potato salad, and some honkin' tomato slices sprinkled with basil; that's it. It was a little odd to say the least, but considering it comes with a cheap Fish Fry it's more of a bonus than anything. There were also some ""tweener"" buns up there, and while they weren't Grandma's, they weren't multi-grain or anything either. They were firm and dense and just kind of there. There was only one poor waitress working both the bar side and dining room side and as a result the fish took a loooooong time to find us (and don't get me wrong, by poor I don't mean she wasn't doing a great job, she was, we just all felt a little bad that she had to take on so much). That said, the fish didn't suffer one iota and came to us nice and hot so, like her, the kitchen must have been doing all they could to keep up as well. The cod featured the same thick beer batter as the cheeks (and the full walleye fillet for that matter), but the beefy cuts were up to the challenge. It had a rich flavor and creamy consistency but most of the fish's inherent flakiness was lost. Luckily, there was no latent grease and while it was a solid rendition it was definitely not one for the calorie conscious. Perhaps surprisingly, the Hideaway has house cut fries on the menu and these were about the thinnest we've seen. Unlike the fish, they were lukewarm by the time they surfaced which really crushed their potential. The big squeeze bottles of tartar were kept on ice in the salad bar so they were nice and cold. The thick and creamy mix was just what the cod ordered and bolstered the caloric content to epic proportions. This was an artery clogger to be sure. Like I say, most of you won't ever set foot in Chaseburg, WI, but if you do be sure to hit up the Hideaway. You could also grab one at the Tippy Toe if you're so inclined. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry a guarantee you won't go home hungry...unless of course you can't stomach the wait. hideawaypubandgrill.com/107 W Mill StreetChaseburg, WI 54621     (608) 483-2777",2936,0.09103174603174603,0.5732054673721341

Sal's is a pizza place, and easily the best pizza place for 100 miles (and probably a hell of a lot more, IMO). Their tomato pies are a known commodity at this point, but as real chefs are wont to do their leader is branching out into all sorts of intriguing places - with the occasional FFF being one of them. And hey, I'm not one to complain.Whenever I hear Sal's is doing the Fish Fry thing I make sure to try it out. The first bout in 2018 was alright, but clearly a trail run. This second incarnation was more focused and more refined, and it was one I'd gladly eat again. This version was a $16 3-piece cod special which was worth every one of those 1600 pennies. The trio was thickly battered and sprinkled with some sea salt which gave it an extra hit. Being that the little man and I consumed and entire basket of fries before mom showed up, I couldn't come close to finishing it all, but I really wish I could have. Rest assured the boxed piece was crushed the very next day. Speaking of the French fry app, more came with the fish and they were superb. There were tons of the house-cut spuds which were perfectly fried and supremely satisfying - a huge step up from the lemon potatoes (or whatever they were) that came with their first foray into Fish Fry. Continuing the trend of improvement was a pungent and plentiful tartar. It capped the fish off well, and I took a bunch of it home and enjoyed it even more the next day on my leftover sandwich. 2019's no-bread trend continued at Sal's, but a big baller slaw was fresh and creamy and hit all the right notes in its place. Sal's is no slouch whether you're talking 'za or anything else. They clearly learned a lot from their first (mis)step into the Fryverse and rolled it into this endevour. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and think it would be just swell if they made it an every-week kind of thing *wink wink*. p.s.

They are without a doubt some of the best the area has to offer and I'd wager some of the best that will ever grace your lips. Sal's can pizza to say the least. If however, you are like me, and have previously perused a plethora of their pies, branching out to their other cuisine makes sense.This Friday was a special one and Sal's went off-script with a $15.00 3-piece Rockfish to benefit friends impacted by hurricanes of 2017. It was a great cause and since I figured they might Fry as well as they pizza I scurried right over there with the little man and the little lady. Ocean perch is an amorphous term that encompass several species of fish and Rockfish is one of them that gets lumped in so I'll classify it as such. For starters, this Rockfish was fresh as all get out. It was clearly never frozen as the meat was supple, moist and flaky. In addition, the cuts were large, which they needed to be since they were entombed by a thick beer batter that essentially suffocated them. In my experience it's common for places that don't batter fry that often to leave the coating thick and this was seemingly the case at Sal's. The places that have the system down tend to coat the fish, then let the excess batter drip off for a bit before they take the plunge. This results in a thin coating that doesn't plump in the fryer resulting in a crisp skin. Sal's batter had a nice exterior, but a lot of the gelatinous goo between it and the meat. The flavor of the batter itself was rich and delectable, but the gooey girth was definitely detracted from the deliciousness. Sal's can be classified as more of a ""fine dining establishment"" than your average Fish Fry spot and as such they went beyond regular French fries with some coarsely cut potatoes. These spuds had a lot of lemon or lemon zest on them which dominated the flavor and even overtook the visible garlic pieces. It was too bad, as there was definite potential here. The tartar was also house-made and had a nice sweetness, but was super thin. While it wasn't bad in any regard it wasn't a show-stopper and with such a beefy batter the sauce was an afterthought. A batter this bold really needs a thick sauce that can go toe-2-toe with it and this stuff met it on the flavor foot, but treaded lightly on texture. As an initial foray into Friday Fish Fry Sal's chose to go beyond the basic slaw with a ""market vegetable"" version that just missed me altogether. There was so much going on in this market that nothing stood out and it was basically a melee that resulted in bumps and bruises all around. There was also no bread which made me ever more annoyed by this anti-gluten craze. While I can't be 100% sure, I have a feeling this was a one-off which is really too bad because there is a ton of potential here. I think with a few more Fridays to work out the kinks this Fry could be something special. Of course, pizza will always be Sal's calling card so maybe being even busier on Friday nights isn't something they are after, but damn, I can only imagine... Overall, we barely recommend this Fish Fry as the quality still came through, but was overtaken by a couple less-than-savory elements. salvatorestomatopies.com121 E Main StreetSun Prairie, WI 53590     (608) 318-1761",3378,0.07850102406554024,0.4895727480404901

As you got older you might have graduated into poorman's lobster and a baked potato, but the fish was invariably cod and the side was almost certainly a basic potato derivative. That's just what people in the area expect, so that is what the restaurants serve. While it can get monotonous and a little predictable this is what I anticipated when we got Friday Fish, and like most people I thought this was all there was to it.Of course, Fish Fry can be a lot more than just cod and fries, and since moving away from the Driftless region I've eaten a load of lake perch a bevy of bluegill, and a plethora of potato pancakes. My Friday world has expanded exponentially since 1998, but when we return to our hometown we return to our roots of cod and fries. This Friday we came full circle at the Eagles which is where we ALWAYS got our carry out in my teens. The Eagles is still doing their thing with a 2-piece or 3-piece fried or poorman's and standard sides. It's also still cheap ($10-$11) especially when you consider it comes with a full salad bar (which wound up being the highlight of the meal).The salad bar was fully stocked with crisp greens (not just iceberg lettuce) and all the standard toppings, including pickled herring! The dressings were just Kraft and the soup was a nice southwest chicken soup rendition although it was strangely devoid of any sort of actual chicken. It was also a little odd that they went SW Chx, instead of chowdah since it was Friday, but maybe there was a clam shortage this week, who am I to judge? The bread was also on the bar and just the tear-it-off-the-loaf variety. The Eagles cod isn't the greatest rendition you will see and partially explains why I basically stopped eating fried fish in my late teens. The pieces are on the large side (prolly about 4 oz each) and not very flaky. The meat is on the translucent side which let's you know it isn't grade-A. It featured a surprisingly light beer batter that somehow held a hefty amount of grease. The errant oil leaked here and there but not enough to saturate the batter entirely. Maintaining the status quo were a side of hash browns with cheese and onion that just didn't stand out. While they looked the part, they were just kind of bland and needed the salt shaker like Sonny needed Cher. Some stanky tartar made the fish slightly more palatable, but in the end everyone took at least one of their three pieces home. 20 years later and not much has changed at the old Eagles Club. The regulars still sit around the bar for hours on end, the pictures of past presidents still look down on the crowd with subtle disapproval, and the fish still leaves me wanting something more. Overall, we don't recommend this Fish Fry, and think it serves as a reminder of why I got burned out on Fish Fry in my youth. www.facebook.com/pages/Eagles-Club216 S Rock AveViroqua, WI 54665     (608) 637-2707",2990,0.06151738473167045,0.44406651549508686

The ideal place would be about half way in between - not so close to Madison that you feel like you haven't even gotten going, but not so far that you feel like you should just drive the whole way and eat after either. This sweet spot rests somewhere between Mazomanie and Gotham and while we've picked off a few (Freddy Valentine's and the Shed in Spring Green, and Rookies and The Old Feed Mill in Mazo) none of them have fully resonated with me (although the Shed was pretty good). Since there are still a few we have yet to visit along that stretch, many of which openly adertise their Friday specials, I figured they should be knocked out eventually as well. Today's punching bag was Trader's Bar and Grill just outside of Spring Green right before you go over the bridge.Trader's hangs their hat on the summer canoe rental business, and I've actually stopped at the bar for a drink before and found it to be quite inviting. I'd always noticed their ""FRI. NITE FISH"" sign outside and figured with a declaration like that they had to be pretty damn serious about it. Of course, Trader's is a bar first and a grill second and when we showed up to an empty dining room I wasn't surprised as much as disheartened. Regardless, we were there, and we had the bartender/waitress' undivided attention so I felt all was not lost. I figured Trader's would have cod (almost every place does), but what I didn't expect was the bluegill that showed up on the menu. I was tempted by, and eventually ordered, the $13.75 sunfish, but in retrospect should probably have just gotten the cod as this ""bluegill"" was no bluegill. The hunks of meat were crudely cut into shapes that mimicked the diminutive divers, but the meat was far too flaky, and far too thick (a good inch or more in places) to be the real freshwater fish. I'm guessing the 'gill weren't in stock (if they ever actually are), so they just took some cod and cut it into smaller pieces and tried to pass it off. It also had none of the fishy essence you get from real 'gill and basically just served as a stuffing for the fabric of breading. Speaking of the breading it was fine, but needed some serious seasoning. After having some killer hash browns earlier in the day I decided to double-down at Trader's since they seemed like a hash browning kind of place. Unfortunately, these browns wound being some of the worst I've had. They were insanely puffy, and had a dark crisp skin on one side that couldn't even be cut with a fork. The cheese and onion went practically unnoticed, and like the fish, there just wasn't much flavor here at all. Needless to say, I should have cut and run. A thick and bold tartar held up its end of the bargain, but in reality there was only so much it could do when this is what it had to work with. A garlic buttery slice of a French was laid lovingly on top of the pile and was probably the best thing this Fish Fry had to offer, save for the homemade coleslaw. This slaw was a total anomaly as it shown bright above the the plain fried goods. It was highlighted by bits of bacon scattered evenly throughout that punctuated the otherwise standard creamy mix. I'll say this, I like bacon, not as much as the Internet like bacon, but I like it. It worked so well here I have to think if more places would put bacon in their coleslaw the world would be a better place. I'm sure the Internet would agree with me there. In my never-ending quest to find a great Fish Fry on Highway 14 yet another has fallen by the wayside. Trader's just didn't live up to my expectations, and maybe they were too high, but when you see a sign that says ""FRI. NITE FISH FRY"" in big yellow letters I think high expectations are justified.

Everything was fresh and crisp, albiet a bit timidly prepared - mostly what you'd expect from a place just getting their feet wet in terms of Fish Fry. On that maiden voyage we perused the perch, which was good, although we thought it could use a little more oomph. Fast forward a couple weeks, we were back to try the walleye and hoping they'd found some of that gusto.A fortnight later and it's clear LESC is still feeling their way around a bit. Like the lake perch ($16 and change) the walleye ($18 and change) was a little lackluster. Whereas we've become accustomed to the Villa Tap's massive $14.75 fillet, this one was on the small side and quite thin (it could have been the Villa fillet's baby). While the meat was flaky and grease-free the cracker breading was pretty dull and begged for tartar. While I had a suspicion the sauce on our first visit was a commercial mix, the big squeeze bottle at our table today tasted different. It was much better, much thicker, and had far less of the stank. While I can't say it was made in-house just as much as I can't say it wasn't Thomson's Fish Camp it seemed to have a more balanced ratio or relish to mayo. The fries were also much better 14 days later, and while they were still just crinkles they were darker in color and had some seasoning on 'em. They were crinkles on steroids and while I would have gone for the hot chips I saw last time it was replaced by 1/2 Caesar salad on the menu... :| There was no bread so the only thing left was the second side and instead of slaw I went for the mac-n-cheese which turned out to be a very wise move. The mac was super creamy and had an alluring peppery flavor. It was probably the highlight of the meal and and ""too spicy"" for the little guy. This is definitely a daddy mac...or maybe it was a mac dad? either way it made me want to jump jump. While the Lake Edge is showing some great potential the walleye today missed the mark. The fillet was small, and just didn't have IT. Everything else was pretty standard as far as Fish Fry goes save for the exceptional side of mac and cheese, and therein lies the rub. When the best part of your Fish Fry is the mac and cheese you know something has to change. Overall, we don't quite recommend this Fish Fry although it's right on the edge. www.lakeedgeseafood.com4100 Monona DriveMadison, WI 53716     (608) 467-9491",2448,0.15388757076257079,0.473035298035298

When a new seafood restaurant comes to town I really take notice, and usually try to get there as soon as possible. Needless to say when I heard Lake Edge Seafood Company was opening up on the east side I made a point to go right away...like the very first lunch on the very first day they were serving food right away. I know, I'm compulsive.Of course, I wasn't the only one who knew of the quasi-grand opening and the LESC was already busy by noon on day one. There were a few open tables scattered throughout the length of the neat and tidy space and we grabbed the one closest to the ordering counter. I got in line, waited about 5 minutes to place our order, and had a pretty plate of food not more than 10 minutes after that. Lake Edge slings fried walleye ($16.80) and cod ($12.80) seven days a week, but have a separate Fish Fry section on their menu board that lists those two along with ""perch"" for $15.95 and a $21.95 combo platter the includes all the fish along with some jumbo shrimp. Since the perch felt special I went that route and added some creamy slaw and French fries as my sides. The perch is the real deal yellow lake perch and five fillets in a light and ultra-crispy breading took center stage. These buggers were well-fried and had absolutely no grease whatsoever. The fish itself was supple and juicy and the breading added a nice contrast in texture. While I would appreciate another dash or two from the salt shaker they were still very tasty and a heck of a good start. The fries were typical crinkle cuts and essentially as basic as they come save for a few flecks of pepper. If I had a mulligan I would definitely branch out to the options - homemade hot chips, mac-n-cheese, onion rings, and potato salad among them. The tartar also missed the mark somewhat and I have a sneaking suspicion that it was a commercial sauce - they sell a brand called Thomson Fish Camp (or something like that) off the shelf in the market and I'm thinking it might well have been the same stuff. It had that odd tang like Kraft does, but to their credit, was more diverse. Lots of relish and a thin consistency made it more of a scooper than a clinger which is never ideal. In addition to the sides listed above there are two kinds of slaw to choose from and I tried traditional creamy. It wasn't bad and the portion was massive, but pretty middle of the road as far as slaws go. It really didn't have a punch and next time would definitely try the vinegar variety (or just another side altogether). No bread came with the Fish Fry and serves as another example of how our beloved Friday Fish Fry tradition is devolving into a simple fish-n-chips affair. You have to love a place that serves Fish Fry every day of the week and from the looks of it Lake Edge is going to do just fine. While the market portion was slow during the lunch hour this Friday I imagine those looking for fish to take home come in at different times of the day. The restaurant portion was bustling and I can hardly wait to buzz back in for a second round. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and will likely try the walleye or cod on the rebound. www.lakeedgeseafood.com4100 Monona DriveMadison, WI 53716     (608) 467-9491",3310,0.06955680931090769,0.4899031296572281

We've had the best, and we've tried the rest, and deciding whether to go to new place, a new favorite, or an old stand-by can be difficult. Mint Mark falls into the new favorite category, and when the the five year old decided he wanted to just stay home with mom this Friday it meant dear old dad had his pick of the litter. Dad picked the Mark since A) they have great fish, B) they boast a pretty nice beer selection, and C) in all honesty, it can be tricky to take kid there so this was a opportunity. Mint Mark has a Hamm's battered bluegill special every Friday and it's $17.00, no ifs ands or buts. There's no choosing what kind of fish, baked or fried, 3-piece or AYCE; it's bluegill, like it or leave it. Luckily for you (and me), this bluegill is all it's cracked up to be and then some. Five bubbly beer battered fillets fill out the plate and are doused with salt. If you're sodium conscious you might want to let the waitress know (I've heard they'll make a less salty rendition), but as a salt fiend I'm a big fan. The fish essentially evaporates under the salty sheath, which most people probably actually enjoy, since bluegill can have overtly fishy flavors that tends to turn people off. Following in the sodium saturation are the Mint's house-cut fries which, for me, are damn near perfect. Of course, there will always be dissenters who would prefer smaller holes on that salt shaker, but I guess the chef and I think the same. Teeny weeny tartar and ketchup cups are still the norm, and while the tartar is light and fresh, it doesn't quite take the edge off the boastful batter. It also comes in such a small cup that making it last throughout the five fillets requires either perfect portioning (which I can't seem to do) or acts of wizardry (which I clearly don't possess). The real rye on the side makes this Fish Fry as classic as possible (and steals my heart) while the house slaw puts in its work without trying to upstage the stars of the show. Mint Mark opened to much acclaim, and it seems that not much has changed over the first couple of years. Sure, they're a little more accessible on Friday night (at least there were barstools open here and there which was never the case before), but the crowds seem to keep coming for that oh-so-tasty fish. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and come back intermittently as the opportunity presents itself.  www.mintmarkmadison.com1929 Winnebago StreetMadison, WI 53704     (608) 285-5096",2660,0.21981539294039287,0.4884093684093683

Despite its barley-born nature, the batter remains nice and light to the point were you can still see through it.

If there is one area where this Fish Fry sorta misses the mark for me it's the tartar, but even so, it' better than what many places are thinking. The idea here is waste not want not, and the teeny bit of tartar, while smooth and fresh, can only be conservatively applied if it is to last throughout the five fillets. I for one, like a lot of tartar, and while the heavily-seasoned fish doesn't need the sauce, I feel like the bites I had with it were a little more astute. A traditional Fish Fry features rye bread and the thoughtful crew at Mint Mark clearly know the drill (although I'll point out that on our October visit it was forgotten and I was too far into things to ask about it by the time I realized - not a huge loss but certainly worth noting). I'd also say they'd be wise to kick up the zip on the house-made slaw, although as it stands it is balanced and most people probably like it just the way it is. Friday Fish Fry isn't just about All You Can Eat and getting your moneys worth. Sure that can be part of it, but once you've been there and done that there are still other options at places like Mint Mark. A Fish Fry can be high quality, smartly sourced, well-executed, and still be just as (if not more), satisfying than leaving stuff to the gills.

Below is my verbatim response to his inquiry (which sort of doubles as my review) --------------Hi chef, thanks for reaching out. Honestly I think itâs a very good Fish Fry. [I] Love that you are using bluegill even though I know a lot of people are turned off by it. The batter is great and the fact you keep it light really helps. Personally I do not get any of the bluegill flavor coming through since the batter has so much going on but Iâd bet Iâm in the minority that actually wants that fishy flavor so I think itâs a smart move on your part.The fries are obviously amazing. No complaints. Also love the rye. Glad you did that. My wife and I both thought the slaw could not use a little more pop. And the tartar was a miss for me. If you know my preference is for the super thick supper club style stuff. I could tell you were trying to do your own thing with it which is commendable. The fresh dill was a nice touch but a little overbearing for me. Also for tartar fiends like me the cup was a bit on the small side.Seriously though. Itâs a great fish fry overall and I think you struck the right chord with your audience. I heard several people order it beyond myself which is a feat at nice place like yours.-------------For those of you that pay attention to such things the chef at Mint Mark is very well known and if I were a betting man (which I am), I'd put a $100 on him to win Madison Chef of the Year this year. He's that good. The fact he reached out and even remotely considers my opinion on his food valuable is humbling to say the least. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and a few minor quibbles aside, think it's one of the best in Madison already. www.mintmarkmadison.com1929 Winnebago StreetMadison, WI 53704     (608) 285-5096",1978,0.2878682170542636,0.5164396456256921

It was bold. It was to the point. It read, in all CAPS: SUPPERBLUEGILL. HAMMS. CHOICE OF TATER. SLAW. TARTAR. TRADITION. Mint Mark has been receiving rave reviews since the moment they opened their doors, and I'd heard from not one, but two people, that I needed to get in there to try their Fish Fry immediately. I don't think I've ever had such high expectations going into any Fish Fry and was almost certain they couldn't be met. We showed up at 5:00 this Friday and the place was already buzzing - the bar was full, the wait list was growing, and we were fortunate to land one of the oddball tables for three near the front door. Mint Mark is a nice restaurant and in general they have small plates, which usually means ordering a few different things and sharing them out - the Friday Fish Fry is the exception. The $17 Fish Fry is the only large plate on the menu which also consists of $3 cans of Spotted Cow...yeah, you read that right, $3 cans of Cow. That is literally the cheapest I've seen it anywhere in town...ever. It's like they made this Fish Fry just for me! And yes, Spotted Cow haters I can hear you murmuring under your breath that $3 is still too much to pay for it, but that's your issue, not mine. Five fillets make up the portion of bluegill, which is the standard allotment for the freshwater fish. They were clearly the real deal and all average sized - no minnows here. Each was home to a light Hamms beer batter with a plentiful amount of seasoning that made for an interesting dichotomy. On one hand the batter had a ton of flavor and no grease, but it almost felt removed from the moist fish. They didn't really mingle on the palate and while both had exquisite flavor on their own they didn't meld into something more. This wasn't necessarily a bad thing but I don't recall ever feeling that was about a fish before. Both the fish and the batter were totally discernible and totally delicious. I could easily have eaten one without the other, or both at the same time. It was intriguing to say the least. So many places trot out freezer fries that it's refreshing to see a place that tries harder, and at MM it sets their Fish Fry apart. Theirs are house-cut, fried to perfection, and easily some of the best I can remember eating. The pillowy interiors and snappy skins of these spuds could easily ball with the frites at Brasserie V and that is really saying something since to me the BV frites are the pinnacle of frydom. The smallest cup of tartar I've ever seen was tucked-in near the fish, but despite it's diminutive stature it actually lasted to the end. I'd say that is more of a testament to how flavorful the fish is on its own than the zestiness of the sauce though. The mix is made in-house, on the thin side texture-wise, and certainly not a supper club zinger. While it did do it's job it really took a back seat here since the fish and fries were so far out in front. Falling into the third row of seating was the slaw which like everything else was house-made. While a little sweetness perked up the cabbage it didn't blow me away and wasn't nearly as memorable as its fried friends. Again, this is probably more of a testament to the quality of the fish and fries, and since slaw is a tertiary element, fading into the background and lending support is kind of its job anyway. An unadvertised piece of pre-buttered rye warmed my heart and made me feel that the ""TRADITION."" tag-line on the menu wasn't just lip service. These guys clearly care about doing Fish Fry the right way and it shows. I have to say I was almost hoping I'd be able to douse some of the flames surrounding Mint Mark, but all the hype seems to be legit. It really is a great little place, and this is one great little Fish Fry. While a lot of nicer places have a tendency to want to reinvent the Fish Fry, Mint Mark didn't try to do that in the least. They just took the best ingredients they could find and prepared them as well as they could (which is exactly how it should be). It's clean and simple with just enough nuance to make it unique without becoming a caricature. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and think it definitely hits the mark.  www.mintmarkmadison.com1929 Winnebago StreetMadison, WI 53704     (608) 285-5096",4282,0.20064560439560436,0.5156623931623929

We were there back when it was The Klubhouse in 2007, returned when it became the Roost in 2012, and one took another chance when it transitioned to the Tap Room in 2013. So to say we were a little wary of yet another incarnation would be an understatement. Dahmen's (the old west side pizza hang) took over recently and we though it would probably just be more of the same - decent fish at a place that was likely to see new management in the near future. Still, we wanted to do our due diligence so we swung by when we had an open Friday.Like any good Wisconsin establishment Dahmen's takes their Fish Fry pretty seriously. There are three fish to chose from - the common cod, the standard walleye, and a (3-piece) lake perch. I was actually thinking about the perch but when I heard that portion size I pulled back...for $15 it likely wasn't real yellow lake perch, so I went with the walleye and was pretty happy with that decision. This walleye was average in a lot of ways, but even an average walleye is better than a lot of other options. It came in around 8-10 ounces (which is pretty average) but had a nice light and flavorful breading (that was well above average). The well-seasoned crust was definitely the highlight of the meal, although an above average amount of grease oozed from the fillet. By and large it was tasty and I wouldn't hesitate to order it again. Some steak fries sat next to the fish and were thick-cut but surprisingly droopy. While they didn't have the crunchy exterior we've come to expect from this kind of fry, they were still far better than a plain old crinkle cut so it's hard to complain too much. The house tartar also did what it needed to do and worked well with the slippery walleye. It had plenty of pop and overshadowed the errant oil as much as it could. A bunch of vinegar-based promised to pack a punch, but was surprisingly bland. It was a straight-forward as the come, being just cabbage and juice, so I can see if a lot of folks are turned off by it (the missus certainly was). A nice semi-sweet roll sat on the side and was a nice step up from grandma's basic dinner roll...so that's a plus. In general, pizza places actually seem to do alright when it comes to Fish Fry. We used to pull the perch from Rosatti's out on the west side from time to time and always thought it did the job; Dahmen's pretty much fills that same bucket. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry (mostly based on the primo batter) and are curious to see what a second (cod-based) visit would have in store. dahmensathawks.com88 Hawks Landing CicleVerona, WI 53593     (608) 848-5751",2704,0.10787337662337662,0.47935518782292974

I like the ambiance in their tap room and I like their beer, so when a food cart decides to pop-up there for a Fish Fry I make it a point to stop by. During Lent 2018 the Slide Food Cart was the popper of choice and we found a Friday to pay them a visit (and have a few tasty beverages). Slide had $10 cod and a $12 walleye on the menu and when I saw another patron's walleye my mind was essentially made up for me. The walleye was crusted with potato chips, and didn't have the signature walleye flavor although it did have the look. At the $12 price point I have to think it might have been European Zander instead of the genuine article, but it was still pretty tasty. The fillet was flaky and grease-free, and really perked up by they crunchy chips. I also got a piece of the cod which was home to OBBCs Penguin IPA batter and markedly better than its freshwater counterpart. I saw the cook mix the batter right before my very eyes so I can tell you without a doubt the booze came right from the tap. The pale ale imparted a pleasant flavor to the light batter which, like the ""walleye,"" was totally grease-free. Slide certainly knows how to fry. Slide is known for their homemade potato chips, and the crisps went well with fried fish, but a French fry option certainly would have been nice too. The chips are large and crunchy, and reheated particularly well on our pizza stone the next day. Some tasty tartar with noticeable dill took a strong supporting roll, and the dill, while prevalent, didn't overpower the mix. It was clearly homemade and just thick enough to take both styles of fish up a notch. A beautiful vinegar-based slaw with plenty of pep really added a lot and while it brought the goods it wasn't so strong that it made you pucker up. An unadvertised slice of rye came on the side and made this Fish Fry the full meal deal. As I've said before I'm not a huge fan of the ""pop-up"" concept since it's usually a one and done affair, but I can get behind Slide in this instance. They popped-up for the entirety of Lent which gives people a chance to try it, and come back at least a couple more times if they really like it. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and highly recommend One Barrel in general.

It didn't seem to make sense. I don't want to call it a public outcry, but there were certainly a vocal contingent of concerned citizens wondering what happened to their favorite market and urging them to reopen at least one location. It didn't take long for fabled grocer to hear those cries, and they returned in short order with a new spot called Brennan's Cellars. What's more, the new incarnation not only has the same amazing groceries, but also a primo beer selection, AND a café complete with a real deal Friday Fish Fry.The paint on the café hardly had a chance to dry before we stopped by for fish the first time, and it felt new and a little rough around the edges. We knew we'd return, but wanted to give them a chance to grow, a chance to breathe. We finally made that return voyage some five months later and this visit was different. Things were cleaner, things were less greasy, and things were much more refined. Brennan's really is back! There was a $14 3-piece fried whitefish special this Friday, but the every week Fish Fry consists of 2 or 3 pieces of fried cod for $10 or $13.50 respectively, or 2 fillets of baked cod for $15. We sampled both the 3-piece fried cod and the 3-piece whitefish and agreed the cod was the better of the pair. This cod was simply great and definitely a step up from out last visit. This round was expertly-battered and fried to a satisfying crunch. It had a very creamy flavor profile which offered a nice contrast to the flaky fish underneath. The fish comes with roasted red potatoes, and there is no other option (believe me I asked). Back in March it was definitely a mixed bag - some were over-fried, some under, but all those wrinkles have seemingly bee ironed out as well. This lot was plush, perfectly soft and squishy with plenty of garlic to perk them up. A thin yet tasty tartar plays sideler to the fish and leeches off its allure to some extent. Usually tartar sauce perks up plain fish, but in this case I think the opposite holds true. The sauce itself is competent, but the fish actually seemed to improve it and not t'other way round. The house slaw was also good, but somewhat lost in the wake of the showstopping cod. There was no bread in this performance yest again, which really left the audience wanting more. I saw potential in the Brennan's Fish Fry lo those many months ago and I happy to see that after a few trials and tribulations they have hit their stride. This fish was excellent and all the sides showed their full support. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and think with the simple addition of slice of rye it would easily be in the running for the best of the west (side)! www.brennansmarket.com8210 Watts RoadMadison, WI 53719     (608) 833-2893",2827,0.14591275146422203,0.46118792971734157

These are foodie friendly folks, and as a Fish Fry guy they clue me in when they hear of new places on the Madison food scene...specifically Fish Fry places. One of those places was Brennan's... yes that Brennan's. All of Madison was saddened when the venerable market decided to close the doors of all their stores in town, and it seems like the ownership heard those cries. The Watts Road location recently re-opened and with it came a Friday Fish Fry. Our ""spies"" clued us into the fact that they were back (and better than ever) so we scooted over there the first chance we got to see what all the fuss was about.Brennan's has more of an artisan flair than your average grocery store so you'd expect their Fish Fry to follow suit (and it does). They feature a $13.49 3-piece cod from Bering Bounty, which is wild caught and it shows (they also have a 2-piece cod or shrimp available). The fish was flaky, and pure white, with no skunky, slimy, or translucent pieces. Sure, it's a little pricier than average, but as they say - you get what you pay for. The pristine fish was enrobed in a dark beer batter than looked burned to the naked eye, but was anything but. The batter didn't have a ton of flavor, but enough to paint the cod into a new frame of thought. Minor amounts of grease leaked from the loins, but not near enough to peel the batter from the meat. This was good, solid cod and a valiant effort for an initial foray into Fish Fry. The Friday Fish at Brennan's comes with some potato cubes and there is no other option. These spuds had a dark crust, but like the cod were not burned. They were enhanced ever so slightly by a generous dose of garlic which took them up a notch without overwhelming the senses. Despite their stout stature they were soft and supple, but didn't blow me away. In all honesty, I'd take French fries over them 10 times out of 10. A standard Solo cup housed some homemade tartar which was on the thin side texture-wise. Soupy sauces like this usually miss me altogether, but this stuff had a nice flavor and still somehow clung to the cod. It was almost like a tartar syrup as opposed to the Portland cement versions we tend to prefer. Some superb slaw came in a 4 oz Solo cup and went down smooth and easy. It had a great flavor and struck the perfect balance between crunch and zing which so many slaws fail to do. Unfortunately, no bread came with the fish which was the only real downfall to the meal. Sitting in their cafÃ© and smelling the deli was a definite plus though. Brennan's is one of those places that define Madison. People know it, they love it, and when it threatened to go away they took notice. I for one an glad to see they are back in one form or another, and even happier they brought a Fish Fry back with them. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and will definitely come back again after they've has a little more seasoning. www.brennansmarket.com8210 Watts RoadMadison, WI 53719     (608) 833-2893",3044,0.1537611446093589,0.4472357503607504

The place didn't seem like a good fit for the college crowd since the drinks were a little too crafty and the food a little too pricey. Fast forward a few months and a new restaurant has filled the penthouse space at the Graduate Hotel, and this one seems slightly more in-line with the college budget. Camp Trippalindee (the Back to School themed restaurant) still has the expensive craft cocktail thing going, but also has a menu seems more suited to the college wallet (at least a date night level college wallet). That said, the ""Wisco Fish Fry"" isn't exactly the cheapest thing around, but we had to see what was what anyway.The Friday special comes in at $16 and is comprised of two pieces of mystery fish, some fat crinkle-cut fries, coleslaw, and tartar sauce. The fish fillets are thin and ours had a very tough and overly crispy batter. I'm not sure exactly what kind of fish it was, but I can say for sure that it wasn't cod, it wasn't (yellow) lake perch, and it wasn't walleye. If I had to wager a guess I'd say it was pike-perch which sort of looks like a large lake perch but has a much more boring flavor. Two pieces was a very small portion for the price and they also sprinkled some green onion (or something similar) on it as a garnish (which is just kind of silly). The fat crinkle-cut fries were probably the highlight of the meal as the big handful made a pillowy bed for the frail fish. Unfortunately, they had the same unnecessary green garnish, but were fried just right and more than enough for both dad and junior to munch on. A homemade tartar sat shotgun and was kind of sweet with a notable lemon overtone. It was definitely diverse, but could really only do so much for the mediocre fish. The slaw followed suit and was nothing notable, but nothing gross either. There was also no bread with the Wisco Fry so there's that... In all honesty I like a lot of things CT is doing. The location is stellar, the outdoor fire pits (and s'mores packs) are great, and the theme is inviting. Unfortunately, there are a few too many missteps including the $16 Fish Fry, the $12 Whiskey Sours, and the $5 soup can of lemonade (it was good lemonade but seriously, five bucks!?). Overall, we don't recommend this Fish Fry, but would be willing to come back on a non-Friday to sit around the fire pit or enjoy the sunset with a tap beer.  www.graduatehotels.com/madison/restaurant/camp-trippalindee/601 Langdon StreetMadison, WI 53703     (608) 257-6949",2564,0.06504967254967255,0.540157842157842

Really?"" It turns out that not only are they doing a Fish Fry, but they are taking it pretty seriously. There are several options to choose from and all of them have some flair. There's the Irish Style Cod, the Honey Fried Walleye, the Spicy Catfish, and the ""Lake Perch"" which was further called Ocean Perch in the description that followed (go figure). What's more, they cost $12 across the board which is kind of intriguing in and of itself. Since it was our maiden voyage, and I was sharing with the little man, we stuck to the basic cod with a side of fries.They don't start serving until 5:00 in the Temple and our order went in behind probably a half-dozen or so already placed by folks sitting around the bar so it took a bit for our fish to fry. We got to sit and have a couple drinks and play with the pair of pups (yes service dogs are allowed in this bar) that freely milled about while we waited. Eventually the fish found us and we dug right in. The first thing I noticed was the cod had sat for a bit, apparently while a batch of fries were hastily prepared. A sizable amount of grease had leaked from the loins and left a small pool in the corner of the basket. That may or may not have been a bad thing as it seems that was all the oil that had stowed away. The fish itself wasn't greasy beyond that and had a dark, salty, and flavorful dark Guinness beer batter. The flavor was definitely there but the coting was too thick overall. There was a hoard of batter cling-ons and lots of excess to peel away to get to the stuff the little guy would actually eat. The cod itself had softened pretty substantially under the sleeping bag of batter and while it was edible I'd definitely branch out next time around. As alluded to, the fries were criminally under-fried and likely rushed due to some ill timing. The cook was definitively in a crunch in the tiny kitchen although the portion was generous, so had they been allowed another couple minutes in the soaker they could have been a lot more. The tartar was homemade from the look of it and since it was on the thin side the cod soaked it up like a sponge. It had a pleasant flavor and added a cool zip to the salty fish. A little poppyseed dusted roll was tucked away in the corner of the basket and you could almost hear it say in a muffled voice: ""don't forget about me over here."" With it's dense texture and sweet flavor we definitely didn't. Some of the most unique slaw we've ever come across finished things off with a bang, and while I liked it enough, my wife loved it. It was so diverse I'm not sure it even qualifies as slaw, as small proportion of cabbage was overtaken by kale, broccoli, and cranberries among other things. It was a hearty bite and I have to admit surprisingly tasty, and certainly unexpected. I know the big red ""not recommend"" above might scare some people off, but it should come with an asterisk (*) in this case. The food was actually decent, but seemed to be more a victim of bad timing. The Labor Temple Lounge wasn't firing on all cylinders this Friday, but I have to imagine once all the cogs are in sync it runs like a well-oiled machine. Had we got everything freshly fried and fully cooked it could have been an entirely different ballgame. However, as it stands we can't recommend this Fish Fry, but will likely come back again to try some of the other options. I mean, that Honey Fried Walleye is just sounds too intriguing to pass up, and the bartender who served us drinks and bought out the food was a doll. www.facebook.com/MadisonLaborTempleBar/1602 S Park StreetMadison, WI 53715     (608) 255-2065",3719,0.0507818052594172,0.5209517886756693

That sounds nice doesn't it? You have to appreciate a bar that is willing to go the extra mile and make food from scratch rather than just pulling brown bags from a freezer and dumping their contents into boiling oil. Daly's Bar & Grill in Sun Prairie is one of the few to justifiably make that claim.On Friday Daly's from scratch menu expands to include a Fish Fry and we previously sampled the cod, which was very tasty. We figured the lake perch would follow suit so we followed up a weeks after to see what was in the cards. The perch runs $13.99 and is made up of three to four fillets. Unfortunately, this perch wasn't the genuine yellow perch that is the hallmark of the traditional Fish Fry, but it was still quite tasty. It was a slow Friday noon hour and my fish fried in no time. The ""lake perch"" shared the same batter as the cod and it works about equally well on the skinny fillets...although I'd definitely lean cod next time. The purported Zander fillets have a different taste than yellow perch, which isn't bad or greasy, just kind of bland. There's nothing unique about it like you find with real freshwater yellow perch, but it certainly gets the job done. On our maiden voyage we went after the waffle fries since they are usually the variety that gets some sort of special seasoning. Daly's turns things on their head however, and they slather the regular fries in signature spices instead so we knew to go that route this time around. These superb spuds have a great crunch and come in a princely portion lets you munch until your heart's content. Since the fish was lacking a little something I had no qualms about bathing it in Daly's bold tartar sauce. I went heavy and in reality could probably have used another cup but managed to ration what I was given effectively. No bread come with lunch which for me a is a bummer regardless of the time of day. Last on the list was a cup of creamy coleslaw which looked to be homemade. I definitely caught a glimpse of lettuce in there which the food service slaws don't tend to have. Word on the street is that this is one of the best Fish Frys in the Madison area, and while I can't quite go that far, it is really solid. While I'd personally say the cod is fins and gills above the perch I'd say both are worth your time. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and feel like we'll dive into Daly's whenever we have an itch to scratch.  dalysbarandgrill.com1086 Emerald TerraceSun Prairie, WI 53590     (608) 837-8811",2509,0.0894982993197279,0.4379709576138148

Everything just looked too familiar - the bar, the elevated dining space, the claw machine...I knew I'd seen it all at some point, then it hit me. This place used to be JB's Italian Grill, and the Fish Fry was not good (to put it politely). A cold shiver ran down my spine as memories of that fish raced through my brain. The idea crossed my mind to just sit at the bar, order a drink and head elsewhere for lunch, but I thought better of that (partially due to the fact I had a four year old with me). It wouldn't have been fair to Daly's either. They weren't JB's after all, they had their own take on ""made from scratch bar food"", and they deserved a shot. It turns out I'm glad I gave it to them.Daly's has an expansive Friday dinner menu, but boils it down during the lunch hour. On the phone I was told there was just cod, but when I was there perch was also listed, so I'm not sure what is what. Regardless, I was here for the cod so the $12 3-piece is what I ordered. Since it was slow the fish fried quickly and hit the table in record time. Three roughly four ounce pieces of cod came coated in a standard beer batter. A little grease leaked from the loins, but really just slicked things up without making a mush. The cod was pure white and very flaky which is just a way of saying it appeared to be high quality. The beer batter was pretty light all things considered and while it didn't have a unique flavor, there was something there. Overall, it was good, solid cod, and I plowed down all three pieces without issue. In addition to a plethora of fish to choose from (at least for dinner), Daly's has an extensive list of sides to pick from and we sampled the waffle fries and regular (matchstick) variety. Now, usually waffle fries get the seasoning and the regular are well...regular, but Daly's flipped the script and seasoned the matchsticks and left the waffles wanting. There were loads of both so there's no complains portion-wise, but the seasoning on the sticks shot them far beyond the crunchy lattices and we would lean towards them in the future. The list of other options was too varied to remember in its entirety although the Parmesan somethingerother and the sweet potato style stuck in our minds. Some bold and thick tartar soothed the savage cod and between it and the lavishly portioned fries drained my cup and the one that came with the kid's fish. It was definitely the good stuff. A nice batch of slaw also found the fat part of the plate, and while it didn't have the stank we yearn for it was pure creamy goodness. The only real shortcoming to this lunch time Fry was the lack of bread, although there were a couple butter packets on the plate which made me wonder if it was supposed to be there and jut got overlooked. When I inquired as to whey I had butter with no bread I was told they give you those because some people like to put butter on their fish...huh? Exsqueeze me? That can't be right...I've heard through the grapevine (which is 2018 means facebook) that Daly's is quickly becoming a local favorite in Sunny P and they fill up fast on Friday nights. While the place was pretty dead at noon (it was just one table of old ladies, a few patrons trickling into and out of the bar, and us) I wouldn't doubt they pack them in come dinner time. Good word about good fish tends to travel fast and SP is clearly listening. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry, and will likely come back during dinner time and see if the rumors are true. dalysbarandgrill.com1086 Emerald TerraceSun Prairie, WI 53590     (608) 837-8811",3625,0.1254010989010989,0.47896515450361615

My main takeaway is the Nicole loves a good small town diner, and JM likes good old fashioned American food...and I can't say I blame either of them. So, when they recently reviewed Sugar and Spice in Stoughton (and loved it) it made perfect sense to me. When I went and checked out S&S's website and saw all their Friday Fish options I knew what needed to be done. I found a Friday, and made the family take the 30 minute trek to Stoughton, WI, America.Being Norwegian myself, I should have known (or at least considered the possibility) that this Friday was the start of Syttende Mai, but for some reason it totally slipped my mind. As soon as we approached the busting downtown I could tell something was up and quickly realized we were in the thick of it. It took a bit to navigate the traffic but we eventually came out clean on the other side and had open road the rest of the way to the diner. Since Sugar and Spice is off the beaten path it was accessible despite the festivities and we got one of the many open booths without issue. There are a ton of options to choose from (walleye, cod, ocean perch, catfish, amongst other seafood-y things) and I went for the $13 walleye (which is very cheap for). The fillet was on the small side (as you'd expect at that price) and I can't say for sure it was real walleye. The meat had the right look, but it didn't have the signature walleye musk. I think it could have been pike-perch which can easily be substituted for the lake dweller. This fillet was also surprisingly greasy despite having a light breading. I also sampled to cod which had none of the errant oil so I can't say for sure what went wrong with the walleye. As you might expect at a diner, the salt shaker went unused leaving a rather bland breading to pair with the suspicious fish. Whenever I hit a diner the side I pick is hash browns with cheese and onion ($1.25 extra for C&O here) because diners invariably crush them, and S&S was no exception. These shreds were perfectly crisped on the flat top grill with plenty of melty goodness all around. They were well worth the extra buck and quarter and easily the highlight of the meal. Since the fish was a little lackluster it needed a big thick tartar to cover up it's imperfections and that's just what the diner delivered. This stuff was a clinger and didn't slip on the slick surface of the fish. It could well have been from Springer's up the road as it had all the allure of a big time supper club sauce. A nice soft dinner roll did its part and some super soupy slaw finished things off. The slaw was potentially the runniest I've ever seen, and while it had a  great sweet flavor, there was so much slaw water it needed to be strained off with a fork. If you're into diners I can see that you would love everything Sugar and Spice does, including the attached deli where you can carry out all the deli meats and cold salads your heart desires. As far as the Fish Fry goes there is a lot to like, but it does fall short on the seasoning side (as so many diners tend to do). Overall, we still recommend this Fish Fry as the food was good and the service stellar, but we can't say it's the first place we'd go to get fish in Stoughton. www.sugarandspiceeatery.com317 Nora StreetStoughton, WI 53589     (608) 873-9299",3509,0.20584467120181402,0.5243146888384986

I always do a little research beforehand and we've wound up at places like: JJ's La Puerta, the Sister Bay Bowl, the Greenwood Supper Club, the Bayside Tavern, Fred & Fuzzy's, and the Cornerstone Pub. All of them offer lake perch (a staple in DoCo) and all have been highly recommendable, but this year might have been the greatest yet - the Peninsula Pub.The perch at the Pub is pricey - 19 beans, but it's the real deal and like everything else in Door County is subject to a roughly 20% markup (it's a tourist economy, that's just the way it is). Thankfully you get what you pay for here and the fish is simply superb. It's served butterfly style (as real lake perch should be) and harbors NO GREASE whatsoever. It's light and flaky all around and capped off by a breading with a boatload of seasoning. Despite the ultra-flavorful coating you could somehow still taste the actual fish which was remarkable. It's definitely some of the best I can remember eating anywhere and that includes the Villa Tap and Wendt's on the Lake. It's no wonder they've recently won Best Fish Fry in Door County. Some plain Jane fries (with an absurd amount of salt) came on the side and while I love salt I think most people would have been overwhelmed by this lot. As a salt fiend saying it was ""too much"" is almost unheard of, but I'd imagine the bulk of folks would balk at these super seasoned spuds. If nothing else, I guess it keeps you coming back for more suds...A tremendously thick tartar with a lot of dill played Robin to the perch's Batman, but somehow the dill didn't take over mix. It actually complimented the perch well, but to be honest this fish was so good you could eat it with sauce or without. I'm not sure I've seen a vinegar-based slaw in Door County and the creamy variety at PP fell right in line. This mix was well-balanced and struck all the right notes. The pumpernickel rye on the side really pumped things up as well and made for the full Friday Fish Fry experience. Our family tradition of going to Door County over Memorial Day weekend is alive and well, and the Wisconsin tradition of Friday Fish Fry is more alive now than ever. It's truly a sight to behold when these two traditions come together, and 2018 may have just been the greatest collision yet. Overall, we highly highly highly recommend this Fish Fry and can hardly wait to see where 2019 takes us...in all likelihood right back to the Peninsula Pub! peninsulapub.com7899 County Road ABaileys Harbor, WI 54202     (920) 839-2141",2650,0.24535714285714286,0.4802288667404946

It was basically the only bar in town and everyone knew it. It was THE gathering spot. They had phoos ball, the best bartenders (Lyle specifically), and all your friends were there. It was an iconic spot, but as they say all good things must come to an end and the BA closed down without much acclaim around the turn of the decade. It reopened a short time later as Chasers Bar, but that experiment was short lived. Fast forward another five years or so, and the long time bowling alley has been reopened, but not as a place to test your skill on the lanes or just a bar. It's now Gassers Bar and Grill and they serve a full menu all day every day with part of it being a Friday Fish Fry.I swung in for a quick lunch since I was running around town helping to prepare for my brother's wedding the next day. The lunch special is either $9 2-piece or $10 3-piece and I was hungry as hell so you can guess where I went. Gassers is a Sysco shop so take that for what it's worth. I personally don't dislike Sysco stuff, but it's worth mentioning since there are people out there that think differently. I ate fast so I didn't really take too much stock in the food, but here was my takeaway. The fish was a bit bland. The beer batter didn't have any flavor of it's own and was pretty greasy. After my first bite I held my finger up and could see them glistening under the midday sun that burst through the bar room windows. Despite the underwhelming flavor the portion was generous, and the fish itself was nice and flaky, so it didn't appear that they bought the bottom of the barrel cod. House-cut fries were a surprising treat to find on the plate as I expected to see typical freezer fries. These spuds were a little starchy, but still a step or two above a plain old crinkles. The tartar was likely scooped straight from a big Sysco jug, but as I've said before, Sysco makes a pretty good sauce. It was thick and creamy and totally satisfactory. A nice slice of white bread and some creamy slaw were just like everything else, very Sysco-y, but very acceptable. The BA will forever be missed but Gassers has filled those shoes admirably and as near as I can tell will have some real staying power. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and think for $10 you can't go really go wrong.

Whether that rep is deserved or not is debatable (the omnipresent ""No Drug Dealing Allowed"" signs would suggest it is), and while I've never been there after dark I can say during daytime hours it's actually a pretty nice place. It's surprisingly clean, they have a bunch of gaming machines, and the bartenders we've had have been very hospitable. If you're a biker or a NASCAR fan you certainly know all about Lamark and if you're a Fish Fry fan you should too...I only wish someone had told me about it.I basically stumbled upon the Lamark fry when I took my wife there to get a drink on my birthday night out. I saw the fryer that day, asked about their Friday specials, and came back the first Friday I could. For $10 you get a 2-piece cod and you can tack on additional pieces if you'd like. I'll focus on the cod here since it was far and away the best part of the meal. These babies were big and meaty with an incredibly light and flaky breading. This is definitely not pre-battered junk, and the breading had lots of seasoning including a black pepper punch that takes hold and doesn't let go. The fish itself was 100% flaky and delicious and I only wished I'd ordered one more piece. It was surprisingly superb. Beyond the fish there isn't a whole lot more to say (although there doesn't really need to be). The crinkle fries were just that, and the tartar seemed to be a food service variety. I will say of the sauce that it had that greenish twinge that most stinky commercial sauces have but not the raunchy flavor. It came in a big squeeze bottle fresh from the fridge so the thick mix was nice and cold. When we walked in I noticed rolls sitting by the fry station but one didn't appear with our fish. I assume it was supposed to come since it's not like they were saving them for dinner or something, but with a kid in tow I didn't have time to go ask what was what. Not a huge loss, but something worth noting. Lastly was the slaw which looked like it would be terrible, but was surprisingly good. It had a real pleasant zip and a bevy of golden raisins (which I typically hate). For some reason the raisins worked with this mix and offset the stank of the sauce. It was definitely not your basic Sysco brew. As far as I know Lamark starts serving their fish at 11:00 and once it runs out its done, so if you're thinking of stopping by for late dinner you might want to think again. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and think it could be one of those hidden gems in Madison that people don't talk about just 'cause. I for one will give them another shot in the near future and if things shake out like they did this time will have no problem signing off of that cod. And hey, they have pull tabs!

Started at Parthenon on State Street, moved to a gas station in the town of Westport, and now in their own fancy building next door to said gas station; they're survivors and those who eat them (myself included) swear by them. Of course, this isn't a gyro blog, this is a Fish Fry review site and Fish Fry is exactly the directions the new Athens Grill is moving in. It could just be a one-off kind of thing (so don't get too excited) but the last two weeks in June Athens has advertised a $15 wild caught lake perch or $11 2-piece cod. Both fish share the same beer batter which can be a death sentence for perch, but this one was light and had a tremendous flavor. While it was too spicy for the little one, I loved it and only wished I'd had more of it. The benevolent coating didn't overpower the perch and didn't get greasy. The only drawback was the 4-piece portion - one of which got dolled out to the kid so I only got three. Conversely, the cod loins were fat and meaty and partied just as hard with the beer batter and were probably a better deal all things considered. Athens Fish Fry fries are the same fries you get with a gyro. The thick Julienne cuts are pillowy soft and the portion doesn't leave you wanting. Gyro shops specialize in tzatziki so you'd think they'd know sauces in general and the tartar was a good one. It was ultra thick and creamy with a pleasant pop that was enjoyed by all. There was some good chunkage in there so I'd have to say it was made special just for the Fish Fry. A big plastic container of vinegar-based slaw with a Mediterranean flair took precedence over the basket with big old chunks of carrots and peppers. It was decent, but in all honesty I'd prefer a generic creamy slaw any day. There was also no bread which I guess must not be a Greek thing. Pita? The new Athens Grill is surprisingly upscale, with a nice bar a huge seating area. They even have a fancy coffee siphon and menu that goes far beyond gyros so a Friday Fish Fry seemingly fits right in. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and only hope it becomes an every week thing. For us it's close, it's tasty, it's very appealing. theathensgrill.com/5430 Willow RoadWaunakee, WI 53597     (608) 220-3340",2273,0.21899446849446855,0.5443977873977873

It was pretty much gross which, as you can imagine, precluded us from returning. Well, as they say, time (10 years worth) heals all wounds, and we decided they deserved a shot at redemption  especially since the Fish Fry is now AYCE codpollock be damned!The AYCE special goes for 12 beans and features not only cod, but baked chicken as well. While we stayed with the salt water dwellers the chicken is undoubtedly a bonus, at least for some. The dining room has a nostalgic charm that some would gladly call rustic, while others would unabashedly say dingy. I actually kind of liked it and the Fish Fry that came with it. The first round started with three pieces and they actually looked good. Unfortunately, the pretty pieces had a lot of grease which necessitated constant rotation. High maintenance fish is never great regardless of how flaky or lightly breaded it may be. These slick suckers were hard to handle and although well-seasoned, the flavor was lost to the heavy oil. Some thick-cut, battered fries buddied up to the fishs lubricated loins and were surprisingly good.  These spuds were extra crunchy and offset the hefty cod to some extent, although a slightly larger portion would have been more than welcomed with the AYCE fish. Greasy fish is essentially inedible without a thick tartar and the CT has it. Unfortunately, the Dixie cup we got with the initial trio was far too shallow to help matters much and ran out half way through piece #2. The sauce has a nice consistency and made the fish much better once we re-upped with the second batch. Somewhat surprisingly a basket of ciabatta rolls with cinnamon butter came before the fish, and while they werent really good, they were at least unique. Perhaps even more surprisingly, the Club Tavern has a legit salad bar which we loaded up on it before the fish came around. It featured mixed greens, cottage cheese, potato salad, coleslaw and much more, all which were decent although likely just Sysco sourced. The icing on the cake were the six dressings and two soups to choose from all which were commendable. Not bad. Not bad at all. This is a tough one. On one hand, the fish was a greasy mess, although AYCE. On the other hand the sides were tasty and plentiful, and there was a salad barso what do you do? Overall, we can recommend this Fish Fry, although barely so. Its good enough to come back for, although, in all honesty, it might be another 10 years www.clubtavern.com1915 Branch StreetMiddleton, WI 53562     (608) 836-3773",2626,0.0935218253968254,0.5462165178571431

Buy a lake house. Eat a Fish Fry at Kegel's. I guess I can check one of those off my bucket list!Milwaukee (and its environs) is basically the Mecca of Fish Fry and just like anywhere else in Wisconsin the locals all have an opinion on which bar or supper club has the areas best. I've heard it's at Turner Hall, and I've heard it's The Packing House, I've also heard it's the Serb Hall or a place called Erv's Mug. More recently I'd heard from a couple individuals that Kegel's Inn was the spot - best booze, best ambiance, best fish...basically the total package. Since were were headed to Summerfest for a show I figured we'd leave a little early and pay Kegel's a visit, and that's just what we did. Kegel's isn't a tiny place, but it's not exactly the Taj Mahal either. Their bar area seats roughly 30, two of which were us for a good 45 minutes or so. We had plenty of time to ""revel in the craftsmanship"" and enjoy a couple (surprisingly spendy) cocktails...also the Old Fashioneds are NOT muddled if that's a concern of yours. Once seated things hummed right along despite the exasperated looks on the faces of the waitresses. As a Milwaukee mainstay (it's technically West Allis, but forgive me for loving alliteration) Kegel's has every fish you'd expect to see on a Friday menu - cod, lake perch, bluegill, and walleye as well as shrimp and scallops. Since it was our maiden voyage I stuck to the cod and opted for the $14 large (6-piece) over the $12 small (4-piece). The fish looked very nice once it arrived, although ""LARGE"" was a bit of an overstatement for this plate. Yes, there were 6 pieces, but each one was maybe an ounce and a half. In reality it added up to a typical 3-piece which for $14 isn't a great deal...it's not a rip off or anything, but not jaw-droppingly cheap either. As far as the texture goes, the cod was light and flaky and 100% devoid of grease - there is definitely some frying mastery in that kitchen. The breading was crumbly and kept the flaky fish in tact, but really didn't have much seasoning to it. Overall, it made for easy munching, but another hint of salt would certainly go a long way. As far the BoM claims, it was undoubtedly good, but I think of several places that best it hands down. Sitting shotgun to the fish and stealing the show IMO were Kegel's potato pancakes. These spuds were stellar and not soft or droopy like some of the others I've had. These were firm and could be picked up and eaten like a potato chip (which gleefully I did). The flavor was nothing less than outstanding especially when plunged into provided apple sauce. I went to town on them and could likely have eaten a dozen, but settled for the two on the plate. The tartar was a true supper club clinger and zinger. It easily made up for the missing seasoning in the breading and took the cod to the next level of delectableness. A couple pieces of pumpernickel rye did their duty of keeping the Milwaukee in this Fish Fry and a creamy slaw with a light horseradish flavor did the job for me. All in all it was pretty fantastic Fish Fry and while I can't say it's the best I've had, and can't imagine it's the best in all of Milwaukee, I'd gladly go back to sample some of those freshwater fillets. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and while we may not think it's the absolute best, we wouldn't blame you if you do. It's definitely got it all. www.kegelsinn.com/5901 W National AvenueWest Allis, WI 53214     (414) 257-9999",3493,0.26909360040312424,0.46899596875787336

As someone who grew up in an agricultural community it always boggled my mind that most of the food we bought at our local grocery store came from 1000s of miles away when there was perfectly good stuff in the field just up the road. It's nice to see that like-minded individuals championed that concept and have made a movement out of it. Usually local means fresher, healthier, and in the case of SW Wisconsin better for the economy. Of course, when you're talking SW Wisconsin and you're talking Fish Fry, you're talking about cod (which is anything but local), but hopefully you're at least talking sustainable, and that's exactly the conversation at Cow & Quince.Cow & Quince down in New Glarus is the definition of a Farm to Table restaurant. Most everything on the menu is local (or a the least regional) and prepared in a such a way that it comes to you as fresh and vibrant as possible...the Friday Fish Fry is no exception. The C&Q Fry runs $16, and consists of two pieces of wild caught cod with the standard trimmings (minus the bread). Wild caught cod comes from Pacific waters and is said to be the most sustainable cod fishery on the planet, so you'll expect to pay a premium for it. As you might expect this premium product was incredibly excellent. It featured big flaky planks of pristine meat that peeled apart effortlessly when desired, but held together well under the weight of a delicate beer batter. The bubbly batter had a splendid flavor, compliments of a savvy salt application. Between the fancy fish and the beauty of a batter there was a lot going on and while I wish there was one more piece in the mix, the twin cuts were substantive. Now, I'm sort of surprised that Cow & Quince does a FFF at all since they have the whole local and organic vibe, but they tried to keep things a little less fried by substituting some skillet potatoes for the standard French fries. These spuds were a real mixed bag with some being over-fried and others under-fried. They were a underwhelming lot and paled in comparison to the scrumptious fish. A house-made tartar had a notable lemon sweetness that was balanced out by some tart relish. Overt lemon flavor is a bit of a turnoff for me, but this one was just subtle enough that it didn't dominate the flavor profile. As I mentioned above, no bread came with the fish, although they do serve rye with other menu items, so a slab should be a possibility. A surprisingly uninspired slaw rounded things out in its stead, and was basically just cabbage and vinegar. There are plenty of good Fish Frys in New Glarus - the Glarner Stube, and Hotel among them - and those places tend to be packed on Friday nights. Cow & Quince wasn't busy at 6:00 when we showed up which is one reason I'd suspect they added a Fish Fry special - the old ""if you can't beat 'em, join 'em"" philosophy, and I'd say they have a niche. The cod was superb, and if they can straighten out the rest of the sides they could really have something special here. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and think we'll come down to chat them up again soon enough. www.cowandquince.com/407 2nd StreetNew Glarus, WI 53574     (608) 527-2900",3232,0.13356845396319075,0.3847320321004532

I've never actually figured out if ""greasy spoon"" a term of endearment or what, but when you're talking about diners that term invariably seems to come up. I kind of like it in that it conjures up images of down home cooking and blatant disregard for anything healthy. Most diners follow a formula and in Wisconsin Friday Fish Fry is a variable in that equation. The Prairie Diner in SP is no exception to that rule. They have a $9.50 3-piece cod special all day on Fridays, as well as a 2-piece cod, ocean perch, and walleye. The PD is as clean as any greasy spoon you'll find and handled by one friendly waitress. She hustles to and fro, waiting on all comers with a smile and spring in her step. The line cook here is no slouch either and I had a big old plate of grub in front of me less than five minutes after my slip hit the clip. Three good sized pieces of cod took center stage on this plate with their light flour breading. As is typical at diners, they don't want to offend the taste buds, and as such there wasn't a whole lot of flavor to this breading. The fillets themselves were also clearly not of the highest quality which you sort of have to expect at that price point. Some of the meat was tending towards translucence and there was definitively a smattering of the of the inter-plank white residue. Still, it tasted just fine when doused with the creamy tartar and for that price you really can't expect Bearing Bounty. For me, the best part about the diner experience are hash browns with cheese and onion, and as expected Prairie knocked them out of the park. These crispy shreds were topped with not one, but two slices of gooey American cheese and sprinkled with some kind of Cajun-y seasoning. The left a reddish grease puddle behind that was as intriguing as it was tasty and truly paid homage to their slippery pseudonym. Not only was the tartar creamy, but there was a boatload of it. Two full cups of the bold blend bellied up next to the 3-piece and gave the fish an extra fin to stand on. Some nasal-bending horseradish slaw stuck it to me, and while it was on the soupy side it was easily scooped with a spoon. As is all too common in 2018 there wasn't any bread served with the fish although a bowl of corn sort of served as a substitute. You kind of always know what you're going to get at a greasy spoon and this trip to the Prairie Diner was no exception - it was good, not great, a lot of food, but easy on the wallet. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and will slide back in some day when we're good and hungry. www.prairiediner.com/1034 Windsor StreetSun Prairie, WI 53590     (608) 837-3400",2667,0.18028812974465147,0.4154416839199448

Rustic Haven is way up off I-94 north of Hixton, in Northfield, WI. That's right...NORTHFIELD, WI. I only ventured up there since we had a family camping trip up that way and there was no way I was skipping my fish. The FF at RH is pretty straight forward: a $10 3-piece cod or a $9 2-piece cod. Either the bartender was sweet on me, or the cook was feeling generous this Friday but I got four pieces instead of three...in all honesty the bartender said the cook threw an extra one in since she thought they were small. They were nice little nuggets with a basic beer batter - not too thick and not too thin. It was very enjoyable and while it looked greasy there was hardly a drop to be seen. The most basic of all basic crinkle-cut fries came along for the ride and were as boring as you'd expect. The tartar came in a condiment caddy and was simply there for the taking and take I did. It was a thick creamer with plenty of pop - exactly what you want with a basic beer battered cod. A forgettable slaw fell on the creamy end of the spectrum and if I had to guess I'd wager Sysco had set up shop. A couple pieces of garlic toast were perched on the on the side of the basket and better than a basic bun, but just barely.

From Fitz's to the Lakeside, and Fish Tales to Sunset Harbor these guys just know how to fry fish. Every one of these places is lights out and if asked to pick a favorite I'm not sure I could. I'd just say on any given Friday to pick one and enjoy. This week we enjoyed the midday sun at Sunset Harbor.This week Sunset had bluegill on special, but since it was our maiden voyage to their strip I stuck with the $16 3-piece cod. There is a also a cheaper 2-piece cod available for those thinking that sixteen beans is a little steep for cod...but I was hungry and wanted to see what I got for my money (I wasn't disappointed fyi). It was slow on the south shore this afternoon, so we got our food within 10 minutes of ordering and it looked simply splendid. When you're talking Fish Fry the fish is far and away the most important part so let's start there: it was superb, end of story...  ...Just kidding, if you know me at all you know there if more to story than that so allow me to elaborate...In addition to the fact the pieces were gargantuan (a good 4 oz. each) the Hopilicious beer batter was simply scrumptious and took those meaty chunks to the next level. It was rich and creamy, but also peppery and pungent. It formed a divine dichotomy with the flaky fish and had me happily ripping the batter of Jr's chunk and eating it free-form. This was the good stuff and any thoughts of the exorbitant price quickly faded. A few side options exist whether you show up for lunch or dinner and I opted for the battered fries over the standard crinkles, which turned out to be a sage decision. Like the fish, these suckers came in a mammoth portion and had the satisfying crunch and pillow-y interiors fry fiends like myself covet. There is also a sweet potato rendition and baked potatoes available after 4pm for an extra buck. Personally, I'd stick with the battered regardless of the hour. The tartar was a big dipper and dip I did. The fish loved rolling around in the slippery tub and while it could easily have run out with such large pieces of fish I went light on couple bites since the flavor of the fish was sharp enough without it as well. It was a great contrast and when you add up the flaky fish, the beautiful batter, and the tantalizing tartar a trifecta of taste like few have ever achieved came into perfect harmony. Some slaw came domed straight off the lunch lady's ice cream scoop and looked every bit of homemade. If featured lots of carrot and a pleasant pop that ensured every morsel got devoured. Sitting in for a basic bun, or slice of rye were a couple hush puppies complete with cinnamon butter. The lovely little spheres of crumbly goodness filled the carb void and did so admirably. With so many great places up on the lake it was always easy for us to look past Sunset Harbor in favor of known commodities like Fitz's and Fish Tales, but not anymore. This cod was simply too good and the place too inviting. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and can hardly wait for our next visit to the Harbor. Who knows?

I take that back...having friends that own a lake house AND invite you up to it every year is the next best thing to owning one yourself. Our good friends Brian and Mallory have a place up on Castle Rock Lake, and once every year we visit them for a weekend, starting on a Friday. Of course, since the festivities kick off on Friday night there is a requisite Fish Fry involved.We're making our way around the west shore of the flowage and this year we docked at Shipwreck Bay. For those that have never been up that way, Castle Rock is a party lake (by which I mean people drink non-stop), and Shipwreck caters to that crowd with a large marina and mammoth dock-side patio. They also take their Friday Fish Fry seriously with literally ALL the usual suspects - cod, walleye, lake perch, bluegill, and even had a $10 AYCE Pollock. For a Fish Fry fiend like myself it was hard to narrow the field, but I settled on the $15 bluegill with a side of (what the waitress claimed were) genuine potato pancakes. It took a looooooong time for the fish to fry, but luckily the booze was flowing and it didn't hinder our spirits one bit. Our four year old had loads of activities (thanks to his well-organized mother) and didn't seem to mind the delay so we took it in stride. At first blush I doubted that the bluegill was the genuine article as the fillets were suspiciously large (like three to an order large). However, it did have the signature sunfish flavor so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt on this one. Each was lightly dusted in conservatively seasoned breading and fried just right. They were rigid, but not crispy, and still plenty juicy which made them easy to handle just like the potato pancakes... Just like the potato pancakes you say!? Yup...these pancakes were like nothing I've seen before, but to be fair, I haven't see a ton. They were firm, thicker than average, and could be eaten like chips. Three on the plate made for a generous portion, and while they didn't necessarily look the part (like the fish) the flavor was divine (also like the fish). They were onion-y and herb-y and offset by the sweetness of the apple sauce on the side (syrup or sour cream were also options so you know they take things pretty seriously). A big squeeze bottle of tartar was there for the taking and I plopped a big old dollop down right next to the thin fillets. It was a great supper club style sauce with a kick and punch that put the bluegill over the hump. A nice piece of pump rye did it's job and the bevy of second side choices kept us on our toes. From slaw and cottage cheese to salad or soup the world was our oyster. I was feeling ballsy after a few whiskey sours and went for the chowder which was about as average as a chowder gets. A couple clam bites near the bottom, and more potato than anything else, resulted in a soup that wasn't bad but was far from mind-blowing. If you're lucky enough to own a lake house up on Castle Rock or even if you're just lucky enough to have friends that do make sure to take a Friday and get wrecked at the Ship. The place is always bumpin' and they clearly take their Friday specials very seriously. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and think it's one hell of a way to start a weekend at The Lake! shipwreckbay-castlerock.comN7265 Shacks RoadMauston, WI 53948     (608) 847-2401",3429,0.1704016986911723,0.4945161514898357

Due to the extreme flooding in Madison we decided to head north this Friday and try somewhere off the beaten path. I knew Wood BBQ was doing a Fish fry (because their owner reached out on social media and told me they were) and figured this was as good a time as any to put them to the test. We saddled up the kid and took the half hour drive to Sauk City to see what Wood had in store.We crested the bridge over the big river about 5:30 and were a little surprised to see the number of people coming and going from the tiny BBQ joint. Luckily for us, it seems about 80% of the orders were of the take-out variety and there were plenty of red and white checkered table-clothed tables for us to choose from. We ordered some ribs, a 3-piece haddock, and an extra piece with a side of fries for the kid. Apparently Wood BBQ is in an old Dairy Queen building and people from the area don't want you to forget it. For me ambiance isn't everything and when the food is this good it doesn't really matter to me. Our fish fried in the blink of an eye and looked like you'd expect a Fish Fry at a BBQ joint to look - a paper plate, paper serving trays for the fries and slaw, and a Solo cup of sauce. It's a lot of throw-away paper to be sure, but when you're talking BBQ you have to know what you're getting yourself into...and I did. All garbage aside, the food was fantastic. The haddock was pristine - juicy without being greasy, and home to a superbly seasoned breading. Wood knows spice and it goes oh-so-far when you're talking fish this pure. The seasoning offsets the smooth fish so well that you can easily parse them out or effortlessly enjoy the combination. A staple of any great BBQ is a plethora of side options that come with the meat and Wood does them all, and seemingly does them all right. We sampled the seasoned fries, the curly fries, and the cheesy mashed potatoes, but were tempted by so many others - the smoked mac-n-cheese foremost among them. Each of our sides paired admirably with our fried fish, specifically the seasoned fries which went tit-for-tat with the seasoning on the fish. Keeping in line with the BBQ flair was Wood's signature smoky tartar sauce which was as unique as we've ever seen and simply fantastic - I could literally have eaten it with a spoon. The slaw was exactly what youâd expect from a BBQ joint which is a thick and creamy mix with plenty of zip. With so many personal touches you know Wood isn't just going to trot out a basic dinner roll and some corn fritters were the starch of choice. These babies were nice and moist and far better than a basic bun (I also realize a lot of people hate the word ""moist"" but I really don't care...they were every bit of it).Once in a while you have to trust your gut and try something unique at a place you wouldn't expect to be good at it. Tacos at a brew pub, a burger at a fancy farm-to-table restaurant, a Fish Fry at a BBQ Joint. Chances are these places are doing it for a reason and you might just be surprised by the results. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and think Wood BBQ killed it from start to finish. Every element was stellar and from what I can see the actually BBQ ainât half bad either. Weâll be back to chop some more wood some day soon. www.woodbbqsaukprairie.com/copy-of-menu1739 Phillips BlvdSauk City, WI 53583     (608) 370-8150",3430,0.16360632183908047,0.48272304324028464

You should go to Howie's...We'd been to Howie's back in the day and it was nothing like it is now. They recently (at least for us) went through an extensive remodel and it's basically a totally different place. It's got a total high-class sports bar feel and a real kitchen complete with a real Friday Fish Fry. For starters it's worth mentioning that our service this lunch hour was OUTSTANDING. After having some seriously sub-par service in the Cities the night before this was a welcome surprise. We soaked up every second of it and tipped accordingly (it's amazing how much service can influence an experience). If you've been to SW Wisconsin you know Friday specials are basically limited to cod and walleye (and the occasional catfish) and Howie's sticks to the Cod or Bust mantra. It comes as a 2 or 3-piece for $8 or $10 respectively. Howie's cod is an interesting one with a dark beer batter that is fairly light in texture, but has an odd flavor which is enhanced even more when slathered with the house tartar. It was just sort of strange and while I didn't dislike it per se, I didn't really want more than what I got. The pieces were also petite which made me thankful I opted for the 3-banger (the 2-piece would have been pretty useless). Whereas the fish was a little bizarre the fries were on point. These crunchy spuds did it all with our only complaint being that you can't upgrade to the Dynamite Fries with the Fish Fry...because damn, those suckers are tasty. The regular are battered up, but your mind can't help but drift to the Dynamite and their signature sauce of the same name. The Dynamite are definitely dynamite, and a true 10 out of 10...the regular are maybe a 7...As alluded to above the tartar was a little odd and didn't really help the fish. In actuality I sort of glossed over it since it changed the flavor of the fish so dramatically (and not necessarily for the better). A plain Jane dinner roll was ripped right off the loaf and fell flat when compared to the sweet slaw. The creamy cole really brought the right flavor to this party and made up for some of the oddity elsewhere. You should go to Howie's...but maybe not on a Friday. The place is really great, and they are winning Best of La Crosse awards like nobody's business, but the Fish Fry just had a few too many holes in it. The cod and tartar (which need to be great) were just a little too odd and despite the alluring fries and slaw I don't think I'd go back for it. Overall, we don't recommend this Fish Fry, but recommend the place itself, and those goddamned Dynamite Fries...I think I'd be willing to take the trip up there just for those.

I like their beers (mostly the Untitled Art collaborations), I like their location (it's close to home AND near a hockey rink), and I like their food (the Fish Fry part anyway, I haven't tried much else). So it stands to reason I was excited to hear that their expansion included more open hours, and a full blown kitchen. I literally showed up the the very first Friday once it was complete to check it all out. The Octopi Fry served from their funky food truck was a lake perch affair and to their credit was the real deal yellow perch. The only true detractor to it was the portion size - only 3 fillets, which is really skimpy when you're talking real perch. With the transition to an indoor kitchen came a transition in type of fish with the new choice being cod. It's still a 3-piece but the pieces are much larger and more filling. The price point remains at $16 but the cornmeal-dredged fillets basically justify it. While they don't expose the cod's origins, it's pretty clear that this is a high quality cut. The fall-apart flaky breading compliments the equally flaky fish resulting in a mouth-watering experience. It's light, there's no grease to be found, and mine was gobbled up in a flash. The cod comes perched atop ""smashed potatoes"" which is essentially just a crushed baked potato. I asked about substituting fries and was told it would be the same up-charge as if you subbed them for the kettle chips that come with the sandwiches - $3. Needless to say I stuck with the plain smashed then just snacked some of junior's side of fries. The HAND CUT FRIES were pretty good, and it would be super if they'd just make it a this-or-that option with the Fish Fry. *Wink wink* Small Solos of tartar and slaw took a backseat to the fish and didn't really do much to hold my interest. The slice of marble rye on the other hand was a serious boon and warmed my heart with subtle stanky goodness. I'm sure there are people out there who will see the $16 price tag and think Octopi has out-kicked their coverage with this one, but to those detractors I say - you get what you pay for. This is good fish and while I'd like some more side options I'll take it for what it is. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and think there are subtle changes that would make it great, but when the place itself is this good, and they beers are this great I'll take it as it comes. www.octopibrewing.com/1131 Uniek DriveWaunakee, WI 53597     (608) 620-4705",2502,0.19630054342820308,0.5186444997083296

I just love the high ABV coupled with the drinkability and have come to accept paying more for the premium products. For me it's a ""you get what you pay for"" scenario and the Untitled Art collaborations out of Octopi are some of my absolute favorites. When you couple those amazing beers with a the fact they have a cook that actually gives two shits about making great fish (even if it is out a food truck for now), you know I'm going to fall for them hook, line, and sinker.The ""perch plate"" this Friday was $16, and while I feel like that's been standardized, I do think there is some fluctuation in the offering from week to week (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong @lionivibes). While only three fillets came per order, they were definitely the real deal yellow perch. Each morsel was home to a bubbly beer batter which surprisingly didn't totally crush the delicate fish. Cooks at beer-centric establishments tend to go overboard with the beer batters, thinking they need to stand out for some reason, but this one found a special balance. You could still taste the fish, but got just enough from the beer to remind you where you were sitting. Yes, the portion left a little something to be desired, but like a say - premium products costs a premium price. Some ""smashed potatoes"" rode shotgun and were basically a baked potato, crushed and then crisped, with a little green onion scattered on top. It was a decent side actually, but I'm still craving those special hash browns...which were unavailable...again. Maybe next time? A food-service-free tartar did the deed and seemed to me to be made in-truck. There was much more to it than simple mayo and relish and it gave the fish a leg up. The cabbage and carrot slaw was equally well-balanced and there was actually legit rye on the side! God bless that oh-so-colorful truck! Apparently the cook/chef in charge of the Octopi Fry is a well-known Tory Miller disciple which, for some, apparently means he's automatically infallible. Thing is, Fish Fry knows no names and takes no prisoners. It's a tough game to master, but an easy one to over think. Many have tried and failed, but this chef clearly knows what he's doing. This Fish Fry has a fresh feel to it, without being over thought or pretentious. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry, and will definitely be back for some of those sweet beers and salty perch. www.octopibrewing.com/1131 Uniek DriveWaunakee, WI 53597     (608) 620-4705",2629,0.10305750962000958,0.4741919191919192

When we heard about the Fish Fry at Octopi Brewing Company and were pumped. The place is literally 5 minutes from out house, the food was being cooked by a known local chef, and they brew beer (which I like). It seemed the stars were aligning for us to come this week...the Friday before their big anniversary celebration. Of course, this all seemed too good to be true, and to some extent it was. On Fridays Octopi has a limited menu, but this Friday it was even more exclusive since they didn't want to muddy the waters leading up their pre-anniversary celebration. They had their Fish Fry (which was good), but nixed their specialty hash browns (which was not). We sucked it up and ordered the fish, but had to settle for a side of street corn which, while delicious, was no potato side... The $10 walleye still comes with a side of slaw and the fish was the real McCoy...and the fillet was a honker at that. This baby had to be a good 8 ounces and I took it to task - tearing it right down the seam into two manageable chunks. It was a relatively grease-free endevour and the batter had a pleasant flavor. Of course, you're dealing with a brewery and while I'd prefer a light breading they are likely to use their own beer, and use they did. They clearly took some pride in the blend but kept it light, so the flavor of the fish still shone through. Naturally, I can't give full marks for the spud score, but I'll give a little love to the succulent corn. It was clearly excellent, drizzled with some queso fresco and other goodies, but it's not a 1:1 for me. I still wanted those hash browns. Some tartar can be tipped to the side and not slip out of the cup they come in - those are the thick supper club style sauces - this was not one of those. This cup tipped to the side and spilled onto the fish, but was still soppable. Obviously, it was on the thin side, but had a nice sweetness to it. The fish was good enough to be eaten with or without it but I opted for inclusion. Of course, if we couldn't even get hash browns there is no way there was any bread coming our way so we'll let that fall by the wayside as well. Sometimes you roll the die and they come snake eyes and sometimes it's Lucky 7s. This wasn't that extreme by any means, but we definitely didn't hit. We loved so many things about this Fish Fry - the atmosphere was excellent and the food we got was good, but we really just picked the wrong day for our maiden voyage to Octopi. Overall, we still sort or recommend this Fish Fry, and think the $5 hash browns may well have taken this one from so-so to so-damn-good. www.octopibrewing.com/1131 Uniek DriveWaunakee, WI 53597     (608) 620-4705",2707,0.28780706727135286,0.5869236583522297

The Regent Street Retreat had closed not long before and both places never really seemed all that popular. They also both had decent food (Fish Frys included), but nothing that really separated them from the crowd. The BSR building sat empty for a while after being shuttered only to briefly reopen as Cold Fusion - a restaurant we never made it to before it too closed. Thankfully, this most recent shutdown didn't last long and a new establishment opened with a new community-centric focus. It's now called Common Ground and is a unique flower in the Middleton monoculture.Common Ground's mission is to appeal to an alternative crowd and to that end the mission is achieved. They host community-related events like poetry readings and self-help groups, as well as a plethora of kid-friendly activities - early afternoon sing-alongs with David Landau, anyone!? They also have an alt-diet friendly menu with lots of gluten-free and vegan options, but of course we weren't there for those. We were there for the Fish Fry...which (unfortunately for us) is also gluten-free. The fish of choice at the Grounds is Bearing Bounty cod, so you know it's gonna be good, right? Well, not exactly... 5 pieces came with our order, but were cut into very small chunks. The frying was a total mixed bag with some pieces being an over-fried gnaw-it-off affair end, while others were just fine. The common thread between them was the gluten-free breading that, by no small coincidence, was also free of flavor. It essentially served as a surface to make the fish fingerable and while we wanted to appreciate some aspect of it, it was just wasn't very good. There are some decent sounding side options available with the fish, but we stuck with the regular fries which were...well...regular. They were your basic child-friendly freezer fries, which is just fine but nothing to make you take notice. The tartar was clearly made in-house which can be a good thing or a very bad thing. Unfortunately, this was a thin mix that almost seemed like sour cream with a smattering of dill pickle chunks here and there. It wasn't necessarily horrible, but just didn't have the allure you're after and didn't improve the already spotty cod. Surprisingly, there is a choice of bread, one of which was obviously gluten-free. I went for the traditional rye instead (as you might have guessed) and it was fine, albeit a little dry. A colorful homemade slaw was probably the highlight of the meal with its subtle zest and perfectly creamy consistency.The vibe at the new place on the corner of Century and Branch is warm and inclusive and a definite departure from what you generally find in Madison's most well-known suburb. There is a lot to like here, but unfortunately the Fish Fry isn't part of it, There were just too many shortcomings and missteps. Overall, we don't recommend this Fish Fry and think it definitely needs some more care put into its preparation.  commongroundmiddleton.blog/2644 Branch StreetMiddleton, WI 53562     (608) 820-1010",3102,0.07709908250953025,0.5206657770090607

Well, in actuality we stopped in a couple times but only ate it once since the second time we stopped they'd switched from cod to tilapia and there was no way we were going to waste a Friday on that farm-raised impostor. The 'you had a decent little Fry, but the highlight of meal was definitely the Cajun cheese curds we got as an appetizer. That location closed down a few years ago now, but we were excited to hear that they'd reopened in the old Taluala building (or the old old Mexicali Rose building depending on how far back you go) just off Cottage Grove Road. We eventually found a Friday to pay them a visit and were very happy to see the fish of choice at the (new) North of the Bayou was once again good old cod.While the options might expand after 4pm, we were there for lunch and the only thing out there was an $11 2-piece cod. We felt fine about ordering it since we weren't starving and for that price two pieces is reasonable. The cuts of cod were average sized, and enrobed by a fairly beefy beer batter that made them appear more substantial. Beer batters can be problematic when they get too brawny, but this creamy coating wasn't overly heavy and had an enticing flavor. It was further accentuated by a little Cajun seasoning that perked it up without getting gaudy. What appeared to be house-cut fries came on the side and while the portion was pretty tiny, it was sufficient for lunch. The cup of tartar had a unique punch that kept the cod in line and while we can't say exactly what it was that made it unique we can say that it was tasty. For a creole themed place they Fish Fry at NotB is about as traditional as you'd hope and the house-made slaw stayed in check. While a little lettuce joined the usual cabbage in the mix, it was still super creamy and super easy to eat. An interesting little flat bread-style roll finished things off with a crispiness that set it apart from a basic roll.We have to say we were pretty pleased by everything North of the Bayou had to offer. From the fish to the slaw, everything stayed traditional although had just enough southern influence to make things interesting. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and will pop back in again some Friday when we're feeling saucy. northofthebayou.com802 Atlas AvenueMadison, WI 53714     (608) 286-1393",2395,0.12951210215361156,0.5005050505050506

If a place isn't packed by 5:30/6 it's a surefire sign that their Fish Fry isn't all that good and is probably being avoided for a reason. There are very few ""sleepers"" in the mix, but one place we've been couple times now and been pleasantly surprised is Smitty's Study Pub on the UW campus.SSP is located on the top floor or the Fluno center and despite it's university location is 100% open to the public, save for special UW alumni events. The only limiting factors here are desire and parking, but if you have the will you'll find a way. Smitty's Fry is on the everyday menu, so it's not a special per se, but that doesn't mean their trotting out pre-battered garbage. The hand-dipped 3-piece cod runs a stiff $16, but considering the portion size and the proximity to major sporting events and such that's not totally unheard of. The pieces in the penthouse are fat and more than enough for a standard, or even a slightly hearty appetite - on both visits I've taken a piece home to be enjoyed the next day. The fish itself it flaky, and the batter light and grease-free, making for pure cod crunching pleasure. A paper boat of house-cut fries come with the fish and believe me when I say they are some of the best out there right now. With their skin in tact and fried just right, they check all the main boxes and then some. A ramekin of thick and creamy tartar also does its duty and appears to be made in-house as well. A so-so slaw doesn't live up to the lofty standards set by the Big 3, but it really doesn't need to as a soft piece of real marble rye is there to pick up its slack. Being that we were at Dexter's for lunch we had real rye twice in one day! I could only think - Is this Madison!? Am I dreaming!? What year is this!? And so forth... While I'm not fully prepared to call the Study Pub a ""sleeper"" after only two visits I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to a friend, or even a stranger who happened to be on or around campus on a Friday night. Overall, we recommend this and think it's a great change of pace if you don't feel like waiting at a crowded bar, or just want a nice Fish Fry in a clean, modern atmosphere..oh yeah, the killer view doesn't hurt either. fluno.com/smittys-study-pub.php601 University AvenueMadison, WI 53715     (877) 773-5866",2536,0.1817819595370616,0.4582045675413023

I was going to get a Fish Fry at Smitty's Study Pub on the top floor of the Fluno Center come hell or high water this Friday. A few adult beverages at various establishments around town cemented those hardheaded plans and after battling through traffic and finding our parking spot I was feeling pretty good about my stubbornness. I'd like to say more about my unwavering attitude and the homecoming crowd, but I'll leave it at that...Being that the Fluno is a UW conference center and hotel there were plenty of homecoming-related festivities therein. People were buzzing to and fro enjoying libations and hors d'oeuvres, but The Study Pub was pretty accessible when we arrived (it got far busier shortly thereafter). We got a table with a view, and ordered our Fish Fry (which is on the everyday menu but still made fresh). I'd like to say more about places that offer Fish Fry every day, but I think we should just get on with it...First and foremost, it took a lot longer than you'd expect to get our food since apparently the kitchen was dealing with homecoming snacks in addition to the normal Friday diners. It wasn't a huge deal, and our food didn't suffer, but it was definitely noteworthy. As far as the fish goes, the pieces of cod were very nice. They had a perfect white flake and reasonably light beer batter that gave them just the right finish. A modicum of grease seeped from the loins but didn't soak the batter in any meaningful way. I'd like to say more about it, but the Bloody Mary I had with lunch wants me to keep it to myself...A bevy of what looked to be fresh-cut fries stacked up pound for pound with the fish and had a nice seasoning to them. They had a near-perfect crunch and offset the creamy fish just right. I'd like to say more about them, but the 3 pints of Pulp Culture I had at Working Draft after lunch won't let me...The tartar was right on the money and the coleslaw was super creamy and clung together well finishing with just the slightest hint of horseradish. Both were seriously excellent. I'd like to say more about these additions, but the Moon Man I had with dinner stole any remaining thoughts on the subject... A full slice of rye was cut diagonally and set on top of the fish so as not to get greasy. I'd like to say more about the starch but it's just bread after all, and since I already had a nice buzz going there's nothing really left to say anyway... As a UW Alum I should probably be more enthusiastic about homecoming weekend, but since I still live here it just doesn't seem to have the same appeal. Hell, I can go to campus whenever I damn well please so it's usually just easier to avoid the crowds that funnel in to relive their glory days. I will say, now that we have a 4 year old the parade was a welcome surprise and we'll probably make plans to attend it from now on. As far as Smitty's goes, the establishment was great and this is easily the best UW-affiliated Fish Fry we've had to date. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry, and almost highly so.

When you're in Wisconsin those terms are basically interchangeable so going to the Hi Point Steak House is essentially a night out at the supper club. And we loooooooove our supper clubs around here. Any visit to a supper club should start at the bar, and the bar at Hi Point is definitely a high point. In addition to their impressive drink specials, they also serve some complimentary bar snacks and the smoked cheddar dip and crostini were easily some of the best bar snacks we've ever had the pleasure to munch on. The dip was incredibly smoky tasting and so thick the crostini could stand on edge in it. It was a great start to what would be a phenomenal meal. Being that Hi Point bills itself as a steak house you know they are going to feature the red meat, and that they do. A 24 oz bone-in ribeye special piqued my interest, but this was Friday night and we were here for fish (and I can't be certain on the ounces but it was many). There are plenty of seafood options on the everyday menu, but a $14 cod makes an appearance come Friday. Their full salad bar comes with all dinners (including the fish) and features most everything you expect from a supper club salad bar. It was pretty much outstanding...as was our waitress. As far as the Fish Fry is concerned the cod was cut into long, thin pieces and shielded by a relatively light beer batter. A modicum of grease remained trapped between the skin and the meat, but it was nowhere near enough to saturate the batter. It had a rather interesting flavor if I do say so myself. It wasn't really rich, and wasn't really spicy either. The best way I can describe it was almost a milky flavor...and yes, I know that sounds weird. While it was hard to describe, and wasn't totally stellar, it was still very good. As a steak club, or supper house, or whatever permutation thereof, Hi Point has a large selection of sides. I went for the specialty hash browns, which were an extra buck fifty, with cheese (+$0.50) and onion (+0.50). While that may sound like a splurge I can assure you they were worth every bit of that extra $2.50. This loaf was substantial loaf and featured an immense amount of flavor. They were gooey, rich, hearty, and a real palate pleaser. They basically had it all. Plenty of supper club standard tartar comes along for the journey, and while it had the thickness and the zip you expect you could sill taste whatever that flavor on the fish was through it...sort of remarkable really. A basket of warm bread came beforehand, and while the rolls looked hard and crusty they were actually plush and inviting on the inside. What's in a name? A rose by any other name would smell as sweet...and a supper club by any other name would be just as traditional. For a Steak House, Hi Point does just about everything right (including the Fish Fry) and could just as easily call themselves a supper club if they so chose. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and think it's on of the best Fish Frys at a steak house we've ever had. www.hipointsteakhouse.com/6900 Co Rd HHHRidgeway, WI 53582     (608) 924-2819",3143,0.25148705096073515,0.5051253132832081

On one hand they feel small, kind of like my hometown, but on the other had they have a surprising amount of culture including a relatively vibrant dining scene. Some of that can be attributed to their location along the river which lends itself to the whole tourism economy bit, and some of it is certainly due to their proximity to Madison, but it's an intriguing dichotomy nonetheless.From the looks of things the PH is about 50% bar and 50% restaurant so to see them put as much effort as they do into their food is pretty unique. On Friday they feature a $12 3-piece haddock, or $10 2-piece and also have walleye that is available every day. Things started off a little odd as the ONLY server in the dining room at the time didn't realize we were in her section immediately, but quickly apologized and got us some drinks. All went smoothly after that initial hiccup and the fish came out nice and hot. Of course, I went for the 3-piece and despite the fact the haddock looked waifish it wasn't at all. The pieces were dense and meaty and fell apart effortlessly. There is something that differentiates haddock from cod...it smoother and even more inoffensive (if that is even possible) and really lets the batter/breading take over if it desires. The flavor is also slightly less buttery and when paired with a light breading with subtle seasoning like that of the Prairie House excellence is easily achieved. It was quite well done.There are a couple different French fry options in the House and I branched out with their signature Prairie Fries (or something of that nature). These super spuds were dusted with Parmesan and chives and absolutely scrumptious when paired with garlic and Sriracha aoilis. It was a dipping extravaganza! You could have called me the big dipper. I was mixin' and matchin', shuckin' and jivin' and generally going overboard with my selection of sauces including the tartar which was thick and tasty, but actually not as appealing as the aoilis. After all the sampling was complete I'd say the Sriracha took the cake...and I'm a spice wuss. Maintaining the theme of excellence was their coleslaw which had a little sweetness that set it apart. It was almost like a mango or something that wasn't overbearing, but definitely let you know it was there. The only real detractor to our meal was the absence of bread, which isn't totally surprising in 2018, but still makes things a liiiiiiiitle less traditional. As near as I can tell the Prairie House, much like Sauk and Sac themselves, is a place for all people. From the dudes at the bar, to the foodies in the dining room, and the families somewhere in between, there is good booze, good food, and good times to be had. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and only regret that to get to it we have to drive past the Dorf Haus, Green Acres, and Wood BBQ amongst others which might make a second date a little harder to schedule, but believe me we're going to set that date.  prairiehousesp.com/1920 Prairie StreetPrairie du Sac, WI 53578     (608) 643-4416",3099,0.1307471264367816,0.4748563218390805

You might never be up that way on a Friday, and if you are you might not be thinking about Fish Fry, but if you happen to be this is a decent little place with a decent little 2-piece.It's only $10 so even if you don't LOVE this Fish Fry you're not out a whole lot, but I do think you'll at least like it. The fish is decent - the meat is pretty flaky but the relatively bland batter doesn't do it any favors. If nothing else it's not over-fried and gets the job done. The fries are house-cut (or so they claim), but are suspiciously thin. I can honestly say I've never seen house-cut fries that look or taste like this, but I'll give the benefit of the doubt since why would they lie about it? Maybe they are just that unique? Tartar is often overlooked by the Fish Fry going public but this version is a superb one. It's exceptionally thick and creamy with pimiento and some other hidden gems scattered throughout. As far as Fish Fry goes this was the highlight of the meal, so take that for what it's worth. No bread comes with, but a very creamy slaw has a twinge of something extra that makes it extra tasty. I couldn't put my finger on exactly what that twinge was, but isn't that kind of the point? There are almost limitless possibilities when it comes to Friday Night Fish Fry whether you are in Madison or Wisconsin at large, but I have to say many of the best ones are in the eastern half of the state. Western Wisconsin seems to struggle and outside of one or two places I've never found a great one over there. Overall, we can't quite recommend this Fish Fry when taken in context with all of those we've had in the past. Sure I'd eat it again, but it's not going to the top of the list any time soon. www.blackhawkgrille.us117 N Main StreetViroqua, WI 54665     (608) 638-4745",1829,0.16594611528822056,0.503968253968254

At this point I've eaten the bird and sides for three meals in a row and am ready for a change...and that change usually comes in the form of a Fish Fry! Being that my hometown is in southwestern Wisconsin the fish of choice on Friday is cod served with either a baked potato or French fries. You don't see much bluegill or lake perch in these parts and will never ever see a potato pancake on the menu, but if you look hard enough you might spot walleye or if you get close enough to the river, catfish. This Friday was a typical 2-piece cod and fries kind of Friday. The 2-piece at the Blackhawke Grille runs a scant $10 and comes with house-cut fries, house tartar, house slaw, and a fountain drink...that's a lot of houses. We got takeout since ma didn't want to drive ""all the way into town,"" so it wasn't scalding hot by the time we got to it. Thankfully, it didn't really suffer from its brief time in transit with the only after affect being that it was a little softened. The cuts of cod were cloaked in a semi-thick beer batter (as is common in these parts) and was stunningly grease-free. The girth of the batter gave way to a light texture that had a subtle creaminess. The cod itself was pure and flaky and made for a solid rendition which is about all you can hope for in old V-Town. Shoestring style house cut fries accompanied the cod and there were a TON of them. The finely cut spuds were a little hard to eat since there were so many small pieces, but I'll take slight nuisance over fat freezer fries any day...and apparently so would my old man. The house tartar was thick and creamy but dominated by dill. The pungent herb gave the sauce some oomph, which allowed it to stand up to the creamy cod, but perhaps a bit too much so. The house slaw also looked the part of a dairy creamer, but upon further investigation actually had a fair amount of slaw water lurking on the bottom of the big 4 oz cup. It wasn't really a problem though since a good stir incorporated it into the mix allowing a little vinegar-y punch to shine through. I've found Fish Fry a little hard to come by in my hometown as no place has ever definitively risen to the top. Sure, there is enough average cod to go around, but to prove the point: some of the better fish in town can be found at the North Side Kwik Trip... That said, this was a delightful departure in that: it was a good value, thought went into every part of the preparation, and next time we get fish in Viroqua we'll probably choose the BG. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and think it checks all the right boxes, especially the ""I want fish because I can't stand another bite of turkey"" box.www.blackhawkgrille.us117 N Main StreetViroqua, WI 54665     (608) 638-4745",2851,0.09264403292181068,0.4748383303938859

What I do remember is that cod and bluegill are both Friday specials and that there is walleye on the everyday menu. I got the bluegill on this maiden voyage. The fillets were LARGE and there were a bunch of them - 6-7 if memory serves. They had a crunchy breading and a light sunfish flavor. Now, were they actual bluegill or a larger sunfish cousin? That's debatable, and while I'd lean relative, they were really yummy regardless.Side options were plentiful, and I went for what I think were the ""Vintage Fries."""" They were kind of a corkscrew cut that left plenty of puffy potato to offset the crunchy skin. They were well fried and there were a boatload of them to boot. The tartar slips my memory, but it did score it well so let's just say it was ""Good."" I don't remember there being a roll and there is nothing in the photo archives to disprove that theory so I'll roll with that (pun intended). Lastly was a choice of three different kinds of slaw of which I went spicy (and would do it again). The thing I probably remember the most though was our an awesome waitress. Not only was she fast, but extremely accommodating. She warned us that some kids think the pizza sauce on the kid's pie is too spicy...and ours hates spice. And she was right, the first bite no more than touches his lips and he cries out ""IT'S TOO SPICY!"" She immediately rushes to the kitchen and not more than three minutes later reappears with a grilled cheese in hand. What's more she chalked the pizza up as ""DID NOT LIKE FOOD"" on the bill as didn't even charge us for it. Needless to say, she got the price of that pizza and more back as a tip. While the Odana Rd Vintage is a mainstay in Madison the newer location up in Sauk usurps it as their flagship in many ways. The building itself is waaaay nicer, they brew almost all their beer up there now, and the food seems to be a step above. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and think this version of the Vintage is...well...a finer vintage. vintagebrewingcompany.com/saukprairie/600 Water StreetSauk City, WI 5383      (608) 370-8200",2217,0.1538793103448276,0.45738916256157636

The rink is a great concept - like Madison's own little Rockefeller Center - and the adjacent restaurant (the Icehouse) was having a Friday Fish Fry special that sounded promising! ""What could be better?"" I thought.It turns out, just about anything would have been better...than the Fish Fry that is. As expected, the rink was great and we really enjoyed that part of the evening, but the food at the Ice House (not to be confused with the Edgewater's Boat House or the State House) was anything but great, and it started from the moment we walked in. As soon as we opened the door to this House you could smell the old fryer oil penetrating your nostrils and saturating your soul. It was pungent and off-putting to say the least. Not to be intimidated, we hoped for the best and trudged on since the pictures they showed on-line looked promising. Of course, it turned out the portrayal and the product were far from the same and the $12 Fish Fry ""special"" was composed of two pre-battered fillets, a bucket load of fries, some Sysco tartar, and a weird coleslaw the likes of which we've never seen before. Fish Fry is really all about the fish and this stuff was pretty bad even for pre-battered. It really didn't even taste like fish since the oil was so old and laden with god-knows-what. The fish actually tasted like burned meat (like meat-meat, not fish meat) which is obviously not good. The only way it was edible was when slathered with the tartar which, as mentioned, was basic Sysco (the House Recipe ketchup clued us in to that fact). Surprisingly, but maybe just in comparison to the fish, the fries were actually pretty good. It helped that there was a plethora of them which took the sting out the $12 price tag to some extent. The shoestring style spuds were well-fried which seemed odd since they likely shared the same bath as the fish. While the fish was unappetizing the slaw equally as unappealing and easily the weirdest we've ever seen. Creamy doesn't even begin to describe the texture of this goo as it was about 90% sauce (mayo and some sort of spice blend) with a few shreds of radachio, and hardly any actual cabbage. It was odd, but it actually tasted alright and I wound up using it as a chunky dip for a good 1/3 of the fries. It was bizarre to say the least. This was essentially a horrible meal that was only salvaged to some extent by the fun on the ice afterwards. We've eaten great fish, and we've eaten okay fish, but only one Fish Fry comes to mind that remotely compares to how poor of an effort this was. Overall, we don't recommend this Fish Fry, and think the only thing that stunk worse than it was the clothes we wore in there the next day.

The town is exploding (no pun intended as I realize the gravity of that incident) and people want to get out and support local business. It's a cool thing to see since at one time, not even all that long ago, it was a bit of a cow town. Full Mile is fitting right in and their Fish Fry has taken its rightful place as one of the best the city has to offer. On our maiden voyage I perused the perch, and this time it chose the $13 pilsner battered cod to fill my belly. Unlike the potato chip-crusted perch, the cod has a very light beer batter with a pleasant peppery blast. The beauty of a breading played well with the high quality cod underneath making for idyllic munching. While only two pieces make up the portion they were large and will definitely fill up even the heartiest of Fryer. House-cut fries are en-vogue in 2019 and FM puts a really nice portion of them on the plate. These sensational spuds are fried just right ending up not too limp but not overly crispy either.I'm a huge fan of the ultra-thick supper club style tartar, and while the Mile sauce was thin, it still had a nice flavor. I'm also a fan of the traditional supper club bread loaf, but of course, there was nothing even remotely close to be found at the Sunny P spot. A house slaw reeks of red onion which, I for one, agree with. It was a little creamy, but not a super soaker by any means, and I could easily see how some might find the onion overpowering. To say nothing of the beer at Full Mile would be burying the lead, and while I liked their Awesome SOund (DIPA) the rest I've tried have been so-so. Oh well, you win some, you lose some. As far as their Fish Fry goes it's a big win on all fronts.

What started with Buck & Honey's as a sort of lone wolf, has morphed into a full fledged restaurant scene with places like Salvatore's leading the charge. You could say SP is burgeoning, and the latest addition is the chic Full Mile Brewing Company and Kitchen. Unlike some of the other additions in Sunny P, Full Mile is a beer-centric restaurant and with beer comes fish...well, usually (Karben4 we're looking at you). They have cod and lake perch available on Fridays and we went for the $14 lake perch on this, our first visit. The perch is potato chip crusted, but I gotta say, a little questionable. Only three fillets come to an order and they are on the large side (like Zander large). They were perfectly fried and the crust was super crunchy, but in all honesty, it didn't have much taste to it. I know that doesn't sound all that favorable, but for a first attempt (they'd only been open a week at this point) it was actually pretty good stuff. I also think they'll work out some of the kinks over time, but I'd certainly go with the cod next time and sort of felt like I should have this time...I just have a hard time resisting ""lake perch"" when I see it on the menu. Full Mile goes the extra mile and cuts their French fries in-house. These spuds were fried right with very few of the nubs in the mix (which is all too rare with house-cut fries - the portion is usually 1/2 nubs). A thin tartar continued a theme we've seen recently, but it was at least made in-house. It was kinda ranch-y and pretty drippy, but all-in-all it was up to the task. I think it's fair to say that 2019 is considered as ""modern times"" and in modern times people apparently don't like bread anymore, which is kick in the junk when you're talking traditional Fish Fry. FM is as modern as they come and the bread is as absent as you'd expect. A superb slaw healed those gluten-free gashes to some extent with a subtle sweetness and unique creaminess, but by god...bread. Bread. WWJD? We've already heard multiple times that Full Mile is ""just what Sun Prairie needed,"" and I'd have to agree. They were incredibly swamped this Friday and it's easy to see why - good beer, quality curds, stellar service, and a concise yet appealing menu. They're definitely going to do well with this crowd.

And surprise, surprise, I couldnt disagree more. Sure, its still a highly respectable Fish Fry, but as far as the best in Madison is concerned I dont think it even comes close. I guess when you have a great reputation it often precedes you, and somehow you can keep getting by on it. Cmon, Madison, were more objective than that arent we?I will say this for the Avenue, since the Food Fight group has taken over things have tightened up. The place is cleaner and better organized, and the food has somewhat returned to its former glory. As far as the actual fish goes, its still no Tobys or Dexters, but the Fry is at least back to respectability. Of course, they do their Award Winning Fish Fry every day of the week, so when we showed up on Labor Day I knew Id still be able to get a slice of the greatness. Since it was a holiday the fabled East Wash eatery wasnt very busy and our large party got one of the big circular tables in the dining room with no problem. Our waiter was a little scattered, but eventually he came over to get out orders. Instead of the Icelandic Cod, or the Walleye Pike I went for the $18.95 Lake Perch with a side of hash browns and coleslaw. Our table also split an order of cheese curds, which were peculiarly cube-shaped, but still squishy and delicious. Before the entrées, some little white loaves of bread arrived. The rolls were fine, but nothing special, although they did set the table for the fish which was to come. When it finally arrived the fish was steaming hot and looked really pretty on the plate. There were six generous perch fillets, along with a huge side of hash browns, a big old cup of slaw, and a small Solo of tartar. The cracker-meal crusted perch was thin and crispy, but surprisingly rigid. The fillets were uniform in size and texture, but were kind of dry which led to the firm feel. Even though the cracker coating had minimal flavor the perch was somehow still masked by it, which was somewhat mindboggling. By and large it was fine fish, but for $19 Im not sure Id get it again. Thats steep, and for that price I expect that greatness. Whereas the fish was just marginally above average, the hash browns excelled in all aspects. The mountain of shredded spuds were perfectly fried, slathered with a couple slices of melted American cheese, and topped with more caramelized onion than is probably healthy. They were a true tour de force, and easily the highlight of meal. Holy yum. The slaw on the side was also impressive, as the bountiful bowlful was really creamy, a little horseradish-y, and totally delicious. The tartar followed suit to some extent as the semi-thick sauce was sassy, but not super sassy. It did have enough oomph to override the fish which was (unfortunately) necessary. Ive always been a fan of the Avenue, but apparently nowhere near as much as some other people are. While I think this is a good Fish Fry, I wouldnt rank it my top 10, more or less as the Best of Madison. Overall, we recommend the lake perch at the Avenue, but at $19 it is definitely on the cusp. avenuebarmadison.com/1128 E.

While the fabled Madison Fish Fry spot can be difficult during dinner time, the lunch rush is a far more manageable affair with no long waits required. When you have a gift card the deal is that much sweeter so it was a no-brainer for us this Friday.The Fish Fry at the Avenue during the noon hour is a 2-piece affair and costs an appropriate $9.25. Swanson (our waitress) came by as soon as we sat down, wasted no time getting us some drinks, and had our order into the kitchen in the blink of an eye. She was a true pro and had what seemed to be half of the dining room on lockdown. Appropriately, the food arrived in a jiffy as if it were willed for by her punctuality. Your nine and a quarter gets you two big cubes of cod, and the rest of the Fish Fry standards. The fish is thick-cut and has a very creamy flavor. This is one instance where a substantial batter that can actually stand up to a thick cut is necessary. It totally works, thanks to the expert frying, which results in a melding of flavors that is difficult to achieve and rarely replicated. The Avenue French fries are the standard supper club skin-on jobs, which are tasty, but have that shell that salt simply will not stick to. The Avenue tartar is also the supper club standard, but in this case is done perfectly. It is thick and creamy, with a perfect zip that gets you right in back of the taste buds. It is a blessed blend and the fish simply loves swimming in. Before the fish you receive a round of those tiny split-top, football-shaped bread buns which are a step-up from the ordinary old dinner roll. While most everything about this Fish Fry is stellar, the coleslaw doesnt quite meet expectations. The homemade blend is a little raw, and has big, irregular cabbage chunks that make it difficult to scoop. Its also a little on the runny side and just doesnt taste that good. Youve gotta love a Fish Fry at the Avenue, and when its free youve gotta love it even more. This was another great visit, and its clear that the Food Fight group has restored the things we love about this place.

Well, at some point the mom & pop who established the sparking reputation got out of the business and turned it over to the kids. Thats when the downward spiral began. Corners were cut, quality slipped, and the reputation was tarnished.About a year ago the Food Fight folks stepped in and ended the madness. Since that time they have returned to the Avenues Supper Club roots and re-established what made them so great. Theyve even added a fish-n-chips special at lunch which the guys at work and I took full advantage of. We arrived at the East Wash eatery pretty early and had our choice of tables. Since there were six of us we took the big circular one in the corner of the bar which I have never, ever seen available. The waitress/bartender came right over, relayed the specials, and hopped off to grab us some drinks. She had a great table-side manner, and provided some superb service. Since we were one of the first parties of the day the fish came lickety-split, and hot as can be thanks in no small part to her. The fish-n-chips is a 2-piece affair, but winds up being more than enough for lunch. The plate is highlighted by two fat chunks of cod in the Avenues beer batter. The golden batter is very rich and creamy, and nothing less than delicious. The fantastic flavor of the batter compliments the cod well.  The fish itself was a bit of a mixed bag, and while the pieces were large, they were more mushy than flaky. I assume the texture can be attributed to the girth/fry-time dynamic, and while it was decadent it wasnt pristine. An adequate portion of Supper Club-style fries accompanied the fish, and featured the classic shell-like exterior that virtually repels salt. Regardless of the saline stopper, the thick julienne-cut tubers were tasty, and went bite-for-bite with the fish. The Ave. has always dominated the tartar game and the Food Fighters are continuing the excellence. Our wonderful waitress even brought extra when she noticed that they first round was a little light. The thick, zippy brew helped the fish in all the right ways and left us all smiling. Some homemade coleslaw came before the fish and was a little soupy, but a real zinger. The vinegar-based slaw would have paired perfectly with a nice slice of rye, but as you might expect, no bread came with the fish-n-chips. Oh well.As if the great Fish Fry wasnt enough, The Avenue comped us a mini birthday cake for our co-worker Adam who was celebrating the Big 3-0. It was a gracious gesture and capped off this visit with a bang. Overall, we highly recommend the re-invigorated Avenue Bar Fish Fry and will have to come back during dinner time to see if they are still drawing them in like the used to Id bet they are. avenuebarmadison.com/1128 E.

Lots of good things come in trios and when we talk about Fish Fry the Big 3 are: fish, fries and tartar. Of course, no Fish Fry is complete without coleslaw and/or baked beans and some sort of bread, so, I guess when it comes to the Fry, Five is really the magic number (Yes, Five is the magic number). While some places can get by only doing the Big 3 well, it takes a special kind of place to get all 5 of these elements in perfect balance. That said, there is also a 6th, unspoken element that resides in the ambiance and the service provided. It is these non-tangible elements that further separate those places that only have great food from those with that also offer a great experience. Skip Zachs Avenue Bar has the 6th sense.We rolled into The Avenue at 7:30 after a failed attempt to hit up the Jovian Taphaus (permanently closed), and were pleasantly surprised by the short 15 minute wait. Usually if you show up at the Nue around this time you can expect to wait at least an hour, but for some reason, this Friday, we had no trouble (hell, we even got stools at the bar while we waited  total score). We barely had time to get a sip or two off our beers before the waitress called our party, and escorted us to one of the big circular tables in the corner of the dining room. We were sittin pretty. Anyone who has been to the Avenue knows the drill, but for those of you who dont here is a recap. The prize pig is the beer battered cod, while less delectable perch and walleye options round out its court. All of the fish choices are available on the everyday menu, so if you dont want to brave the Friday crowds, you dont have to. They also offer a Door County Fish Boil but that just aint for me; Im here for the fried fish. As per usual I opted for the $12 2-piece cod and chose Clam Chowder as my side over an equally tempting house salad. The Clam Chowder came before the meal, along with basket of pre-packed dinner rolls. The Chowder was pretty creamy and tasted really good. It had plenty of clam, which was a nice departure from some of the Clam-less Chowders I have had recently. The rolls were fresh and moist, but little more than a placeholder to tide us over. The bread and soup did well enough, and within 20 of ordering our fish was upon us.As I grabbed my first of two cod pieces it was immediately apparent that something was amiss. The cod used to be cut into large cube shaped pieces, and while these chunks hinted at cube-ness they were much more amorphous. When tasted, a similar unfamiliarity was noted. The cod we have enjoyed previously at The Avenue was rich, creamy, and almost transcendent. This time around the cod was still good, but not otherworldly. The beer batter was acceptable, but was lacking some of the complexity we have come to expect. The batter was a little dark and crispy which leads me to believe it was slightly over fried. Overall, it was still very good as the fish was light and flaky, although not perfectly preened. Is The Avenue cutting corners by not trimming their fish like they used to? Im not sure, but it seems likely. The fries were also a little subpar when put up against the precedent The Avenue has set. They were basically just straight up skin-on potatoes, cut in house, and fried. While they were very supper clubby, they werent really anything spectacular. Matching the fries was the tartar sauce which was good, but not outstanding like we have come to expect. The small portion was not even enough to outlast the two pieces of fish. Our friend Paco asked for an additional serving, but by the time it arrived he was just about through with his meal. Speaking of which, the service this trip was kind of odd in general. Our waitress was clearly and old pro, but for some reason everything was just a step slow. This scenario played out repeatedly: you would ask for something (like a tartar refill), she would gallop of to get it and you would assume she would be right back. A few minutes later, when you were really craving it, and assuming she had forgotten it, but just before you were ready to get annoyed that she wasnt back with it, she would show up with the item in hand, seemingly out of nowhere. It was really weird, but by and large, she did a good job and didnt forget a thing except for the quick turnaround.Usually when a place gives you a soup/salad option the coleslaw falls by the wayside, but The Avenue gives you a hearty dose of their raw tasting slaw too. While I cant say the ultra-cabbage-y goo suited my palate it was nice that it was included.This trip to the Avenue turned out to be a bit of a mixed bag, however, it is damn near impossible not to recommend, even if a few elements were slightly off. The fish was good, but not quite the Best of Madison as we have come to expect. The fries and tartar were underwhelming, but adequate, as were the rolls and slaw. When you put the whole thing into perspective, it really does add up to be greater than the sum of its parts. Sure, nothing really blew me away, but when you take into account that all five pieces of the puzzle are in place, it is clear that even a down trip at the Avenue constitutes a classic Wisconsin Fish Fry, and that is really what it is all about  good food, good friends, and good times. avenuebarmadison.com/1128 E.

I had a bunch of friends in town this weekend and they all had their hearts set on the Avenue so I went along with it.  We called for reservations and the hostess said there was no way our large party would get in before 8:30 so we decided to just show up and see what happened. We arrived about 8:15, put our names on the list and waited. The hostess thought it would be about an hour or so which at this time of night is pretty ridiculous but we went with it figuring it would probably be shorter than that. We headed to the bar to get some drinks and waited for a big enough table to open up. One drink led to two, which led to three or four. By the time our table was ready an hour and a half had passed and people were starting to feel the effects of the alcohol. We were literally the last group of people to get seated and the dining room was practically empty by the time we entered. Needless to say our group was a little perturbed and a lot of the folks had lost their appetites due to the amount of booze consumed beforehand. Regardless, we were here for Fish Fry and we put our orders in. Since I had a very greasy Fish Fry of Cod earlier in the day I needed something different and decided to give the Lake Perch a whirl.The Lake Perch at the Avenue costs about $17 for 6 decent sized filets. The Fish was cooked well and had a light breading on it that was good, but not great. The flavor was good but it was not scalding hot when it came out. For $17 I actually expected a little bit more; the cod is only $10 and actually much better. The straight cut French fries which were also good but were also not hot and would have been better straight from the fryer. The tartar sauce at the Avenue is always good although I needed to request an extra cup since the first one was not near enough. The big three items of the Fish Fry at the Avenue were good this time around but suffered from not being served immediately after coming out of the fryer.Before the fish came the Avenue serves a salad/coleslaw/cottage cheese option, all of which are good and some nice little loaves of bread which unfortunately were also not served hot. The best part about the meal was our waitress. Even though it was very late and we had a large group she was punctual and got everyone’s orders correct. She even managed to get several more rounds of drinks for people from the bar and stay on top of the Fish at the same time.Overall this was a bit of let down. The Avenue definitely still serves some of the best fish in Madison but when you have a large party you had better arrive before 5pm if you want to get seated quickly. If you have a small party of four or less and make a reservation this is a great place to get Fish on Friday, if not, you had better be ready to wait. avenuebarmadison.com/1128 E.

The Avenue Bar has won the 'Best of Madison: Fish Fry' competition numerous times in the past and with good reason. It is a prototypical Fish Fry hot spot. I had been to the Avenue a few times previously, sometimes for Friday Fish Fry, sometimes not.On this particular occasion we had called ahead and actually got seated within about 15 minutes of our reservation time, usually I would expect to wait at least 30 minutes or more. This place is usually hoppin’ on Friday nights. This Friday was no exception especially since it was Good Friday. I think every single person in our party ordered the ‘Award Winning Fish Fry’ and could not have been more happy with it.The fried cod is nothing less the outstanding. It is served as two large chunks which are very thick, almost cube-shaped. You would think this would make the fish more difficult to cook but somehow they do a fantastic job. The cod is light and flaky with little to no grease and fantastic flavor. They also have Lake Perch, Walleye and Bluegill available, but how could you ever order it when the cod is this good?The French fries were very good as was the tartar sauce, just as you would expect at a classic fish fry. The bread is also delicious, little individual loaf-looking rolls that when buttered, tasted like heaven. A nice touch added by the Avenue is a coleslaw/salad/cottage cheese/soup option. I opted for the clam chowder, which was good. It looked like everyone was more than pleased with their various choices as I glanced around the table.The Avenue certainly has an old school atmosphere. There are knick-knacks all over, and tons of stuff hanging on the walls from old telephone to antique farming equipment. This is truly a classic Wisconsin Supper Club right in downtown Madison serving amazing fish every Friday night. If you have not been to the Avenue for Friday Night Fish Fry, do yourself a favor and get over there.avenuebarmadison.com/1128 E.

However, when you filter out those places that not only have good fish, but also have a great craft beer selection, the list narrows significantly. You're basically left with a handful places with one of them being Longtable in Middleton.I'm fully on-board with the craft beer craze and as such I'm admittedly likely a little biased towards Longtable. They have arguably the best beer cooler/selection in the area, and when they started offering a Fish Fry every day of the week I jumped at the chance to not only try it, but imbibe in some fine brews. Since that first visit I've been back a couple more times - once with friends, and once by myself to put pen to paper. The fish part of the Longtable Fish Fry is cod, and on our maiden voyage the portion was massive. On both subsequent trials it was dialed way back, but still substantive thanks to a hefty beer batter. This is good cod, not great, but right in the wheelhouse of what most people want/expect. The batter is thick and rich, does not harbor grease, and takes the focus of the actual fish. The fish itself retains its flakiness after frying and is clearly of high quality. Longtable and their sister restaurant Brasserie V feature what are undoubtedly some of the best frites (Belgian-style French fries) this side of the Atlantic. These superb spuds come with a duo of dipping sauces whether served with a meal or ordered solo. We've sampled several of their house aiolis, the chipotle, cilantro-lime, and Mustard Museum among them, and found them all to be succulent and balanced. Of course, if you want to make the most of the Fish Fry you'd be wise to substitute their house tartar for one of the fancy aiolis. The tartar is an aioli unto itself, but is incredibly thick and creamy and actually goes toe-to-toe with the brawny batter on the cod. Disappointingly there is no bread served along with the Longtable fish, but a house slaw does make an appearance - although an unmemorable one. The Longtable Fish Fry is available 7 days a week, and comes in at a relatively reasonable $14 which is nice because you're probably going to need a few extra bucks if you want a beer from their expansive cooler. Many of the crafts are upwards of $9 which isn't exactly chump change. Of course, these big beers usually come with an ABV twice that of a normal beer so for me it's sort of a wash. As far as the Fish Fry goes, I like it, but don't love it. The fish is fine, the frites and aiolis are superb, but the slaw is just so-so. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry, but highly recommend Longtable itself if for nothing more than the beers, fries, and sauces. www.longtablebeercafe.com7545 Hubbard AveMiddleton, WI 53562     (608) 841-2337",2795,0.23079899267399265,0.4889239926739928

I've always been a big fan of Brasserie V, and when the spin-off spawned the Friday delight I knew good things were in store. You see, Brasserie V has long been known for their frites, the same of which are available at Longtable. Frites (fancy Belgian-style French fries) and fish go hand-in-hand and since Brasserie V's were the best of the best you can deduce what I figured the fish would be... Longtable isn't messing around and they are offering their ""Friday"" Fish Fry every day of the week. This baby features two gigantic pieces of cod with a thick and flavorful beer batter. This behemoth of a batter matches the flaky fish pound for pound, and despite its girth is surprisingly grease-free. I kid you not, there was at least 1/2 pound of fish on the plate and probably closer to 3/4 pound when you take the batter into account. It was as decadent as the come and not for the faint of heart. A nice portion of the classic frites come along for the ride and are super-seasoned (which put them over the top for our five year old, but had me coming back for more). In addition, the 'table has lots of aoilis to choose from and the chipotle we picked didn't disappoint. It was smoky with just the right amount of warmth to let you know smoked jalepenos were present. mmm mmm mmm Thick batters beg for a creamy tartar, but unfortunately this mix didn't answer the call. While it wasn't necessarily too thin, it wasn't thick enough either. Luckily, it had the good flavor you'd expect from a sauce specialist and bumped the fish up a tiny notch. No bread is served with the LT FF, but an alluring cup of house slaw filled the void as best it could. It wasn't stanky, but did have a well-balanced flavor profile that we'd gladly eat again. Longtable is doing just about everything right including their Fish Fry. Their beer cooler is second to none, the atmosphere is superb, and the fact you can get the delectable fish every night of the week is a huge bonus. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and will certainly be back soon for another round and some more scrumptious beers. www.longtablebeercafe.com7545 Hubbard AveMiddleton, WI 53562     (608) 841-2337",2261,0.20966898954703833,0.4883275261324041

Joey's was a cool little seafood place that unbeknownst to most was actually a link in a small chain...this particular link just happened to be in Madison. Over time the chain folded but the beloved Madison link prevailed. It was a heartwarming underdog story about the truly good things in life prevailing despite long odds and tough times. Joey's was known as Joey's for a number of years and their seafood specials reigned supreme, until one day it was re-branded as ""North and South Seafood and Smokehouse"" with an additional emphasis on...BBQ??? Huh??? Apparently this BBQ portion of N&S was every bit as popular as the seafood sector; so popular in fact, that they eventually spun-off their own link, this time in DeForest. N&S DeForest is the last property in a strip mall and apparently crazy-busy come 6:00 on Friday nights. We showed up an hour or so before crazy-time and were treated to their $16 AYCE cod (which we picked in lieu of lake perch or other fishy delicacies). Since we were very early the service was very fast and my first round of cod came lickity-split and hot as can be. Three pieces came on the first go-round and, as expected, had a strange shrimp-y flavor. I'm not sure what it is with Joey's/North and South, but their fish always tastes a little bit like shrimp. The cod was clearly of good quality and flaked apart effortlessly, but one can't ignore that shrimp stank. In addition, the batter was unremarkable, but at least fairly light. I only had room for one more on the second round much to the waitress' surprise. ""Are you sure???"" she asked more than once...I was sure...I was full and this fish wasn't necessarily Dorf Haus good. The South part of North and South has a BBQ lineage so as you'd expect there are a lot of options in the way of sides. We went for the ""potato cakes"" over the fries (as the starch) and mac-n-cheese over the slaw (as the salad). I know, I'm reaching on the ""salad"" bit, but here's how much I care... The cakes were cheesy hash browns smashed into a hockey puck-like shape a deep fried. These delectable discs get high marks for creativity and flavor, but not as high for portion size. The fries the kid got were much more substantial and had a great crispy crunch. In all honesty, the side choices were almost overwhelming (as you often see at the BBQ joints) and I would have liked to try them all. When a hearty beer batter is the flavor of the day you need a bold tartar to offset it and the N&S sauce did what it could. The cod soaked it up like a sponge and necessitated a full cup with the extra piece on round 2. One of the staples at Joey's was the mini corn bread muffins, but these cutesy cakes have been replaces by a much more BBQ-y hunk. While the recipe seemed to be the same the big square wasn't quite as enticing as the bite-sized morsels of yesteryear. CHoosing the mac over the slaw turned out to be 100% the right decision. This version was creamy and delicious and exactly the side you'll find as a kid's menu entree, just in a much smaller portion. Joey's has always been solid and North and South is continuing on where the seafood-centric spot left off; and I'm sure most people take full advantage of the AYCE nature (which is why the waitress gave me the ""Really???"" treatment. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and quite easily so. While I'm not sure I'd be thrilled to wait an hour and a half for it (as so many have reported they have), it is probably worth it if you're REALLY hungry. eatnorthandsouth.com/deforest/605 S Main StDeForest, WI 53532     (608) 842-2601",3623,0.2038687830687831,0.5072169312169312

Fair enough, I'll tell ya all about the bustling metropolis that is Withee. Withee is a very small town about half way between Eau Clarie and Wausau on Highway 29. It's also where my mom's side of the family is from, and home to Beaver's Bar and Grill. ""Beaver"" it turns out was the nickname of my cousin Steven. I say ""was"" because not a month after Beaver lived out his dream of owning his own bar he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and it wasn't long before it got the best of him. He was an amazing guy. A happy guy. One of those guys everyone loved, one of those guys we all wish we could be. So, when we went up for his funeral we had to stop at his bar and try his fish. In small towns people expect more for their money (that's just the way it is) and the Fish Fry at Beaver's obliges at a mere $10. I could easily be biased about it and paint it in a better light than I need to, but in all honesty, this cod was incredibly well-done. As per usual, I was worried since beer batter can quickly get out of hand, but the coating on these fat little chunks was bubbly and inviting with no grease whatsoever. It also wasn't the crap cod that is loaded up with sodium triphosphate to make it heavier (which also leads to translucent fish with no flavor). It was nice and flaky, and sat well in the old gut. Beaver was a man about town and as such gave lots of sides to pick from with his fish. I branched out (as he would have wanted me to do) and tried the cheesy rounds which filled the void admirably. I wasn't feeling the crinkle-cuts and these little breaded hash brown clumps were a breath of fresh air. I have to assume they were just Sysco, but it's really hard to tell since I've never seen a unique product like this from them. It could just be that Sysco makes an amazing product, but the tartar at Beaver's den was spot on. It was as thick as molasses and had some pimiento and other goodies dotted throughout. Unfortunately, my cousin never thought to throw a roll on the plate, as is so in vogue in 2019, but man, I would have loved some additional starch. A finely-chopped and zippy slaw rounded things out, and was also on the salad bar but I skipped the $2 up-charge on that one. In all honesty I'd planned to go have fish at my cousin's place sometime, but never imagined it would be for all the wrong reasons. He was a great guy and he will be missed. Overall, we recommend Beaver's Fish Fry and can only hope the bar that carries his name will live on in the way he wanted it to.

Sure, the camaraderie is great, but in general the beers, ambiance, and food miss me. Also the fish-n-chips is usually one huge fillet of cod (or maybe haddock) with a beer batter that is either - A) devoid of flavor, or B) a soggy donut. It's just not my scene, but there is always the exception to any rule and maybe County Clare is it for Irish Pubs???County Clare is in Milwaukee and beyond the typical fish-n-chips they also offer a $20 lake perch on Friday. Milwaukee is known as the perch capital and CC wasn't messing around with their four butterflies. In all honesty, I was just thankful to have an option besides the Irish Pub style cod so maybe I thought more of it than I should have? To be fair, while the beer batter on CC's perch isn't thin, it remained light and had a pleasant flavor to it. Since it was so rich and creamy the perch was basically lost underneath it which it's wont to do. Still, the overall sensation was a good one, but like I say, maybe I thought more of it than I should have since it was wasn't the anticipated huge cod fillet? For $20 I expected them to pile on the fries but it wasn't meant to be. This gang of steak fries was on the small side and got devoured long before the fish ran out. They were pretty standard as far as fat-cut fries go and not quite to the lofty level established by our beloved Toby's. The tartar was drippy and not all that memorable beyond that, while the slaw was creamy and did it's duty, but the star of this trio was the rye. It was soft, dank, and plush. Simply stellar and the exact bread choice I would love every Fish Fry to have. We'd all be better for it if they did. In all honesty, I would never have sought out County Clare but we were in town for a show and decided to kill two birds with one stone by not only eating at the restaurant, but crashing and the B&B. It turned out to be a genius move and despite the fact the meal was spendy we were on a mini vacation so who really gives a damn? Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and would probably come back if we lived anywhere near Milwaukee. As it stands, we probably won't since we don't, but who knows?

The Rock is for you. Like watching sports on TV? The Rock is for you. Like traditional bar food? The Rock is definitely for you. Like an amazing Fish Fry? Well...The Rock has Fish Fry for lunch and dinner and the $12 2-piece cod for lunch is a square deal, just don't count on getting it quickly, regardless of how many people are there (your wait time may vary). The cod will also be just alright. The pieces are pretty hefty, but the beer batter is bland and about what you'll find. A smidgen of grease will ooze out, and while it might not ruin the fish, it will be noticeable. This isn't bad fish, but more of a fill-you-up fish than a keep-you-coming-back-for-more fish. The brew fries are touted as being special, but are essentially just steak fries. There are plenty of other options as well, and while I was tempted by the lattice chips they were just actual chips so I'm glad I stuck to the fries. Your mileage may vary. A Sysco-style tartar will come along for the journey and may actually just be from an actual huge Sysco container. This sauce will do its job and while that might be it, I feel like Sysco sauce is just fine. A plain old roll comes on the side and a boatload of horsey slaw bucks its way onto the plate. Both are fine, but about as basic as it gets. In all honesty this wasn't a terrible Fish Fry. Most everything was passable and I wouldn't totally try and dissuade someone if they told me they were going there for it, but with so many other great options I don't see myself coming back.

In the case of the new Tipsy Cow in Sun Prairie, what a difference a new building and a few miles is seemingly making.The original Tipsy location has been a downtown staple ever since it took over the wedge-shaped building on the intersection of King, Main, and Pinckney. The place is consistently packed, especially on Fridays when their Fish Fry has become a known commodity. All reports pointed to the new SP TC FF being the exact same as the downtown location's; since my office is out that way I figured luck was on my side and paid them a visit as quickly as I could. Sun Prairie is obviously in a different universe than downtown (metaphorically speaking) and the Fish Fry wasn't exactly the clone we were expecting. Yes, it was the same price, and yes, the same cod and walleye options were available, but the preparation was not as flawless as we anticipated. The batter on the cod had the expected smoky flavor, but was thicker'n crap, and basically buried the cod. The cuts of fish themselves also seemed to be thinner and while mine were all flaky and pleasant, my dining companion claimed one was too rubbery to even eat. Eek. The fries were just fries, which is on-brand for the Tipsy in general. A thin and uninspired tartar is paired with the fish, and while it doesn't do a whole lot it doesn't really have to since the Tipsy Sauce steals the show anyway. This smoky chipotle blend is perfectly zesty and teams surprisingly well with the fish whether the breading is overly-doughy or not. Seriously, you could drink this sauce as a shot...it's that good. With so many places neglecting to even offer bread with their fish in this day and age, the Tipsy puts them to shame with a slice of real rye. It's a nice touch and almost salvaged what was otherwise a mildly disappointing Fish Fry. The classic pink Tipsy slaw rounded out the plates and while one of our dishes was swimming in soup, the other was dry as a bone. The dry version was actually the better of the two. The common theme among on-line reviewers is that the new Sun Prairie location is mild disappointing compared to the original, and I'd say our visit echoes those sentiments. Everything just wasn't quite the same, and when you get a piece of rubbery fish that's essentially a deal-breaker. Overall, we don't recommend this Fish Fry at this time, but fear not, we will be back in short order to give them a shot at redemption...their track record behooves it. www.tipsycowmadison.com/food2816 Prairie Lakes Dr Suite 107Sun Prairie, WI 53590     (608) 318-0232",2590,0.11545745920745924,0.4652534965034966

It's not that I don't like brewpubs (I do), it's just that this particular brewpub is way out in Verona, has a bit of an industrial feel, and is in a location where one ""brewpub"" (Grey's Tied House) has already failed. That combination of factors coupled with the fact I have about a million other places I want to get fish, made getting there a bit of a chore, but we finally did, and by God, I was pleasantly surprised.Boulder has a few different options on the Friday menu, but I couldn't pass up the $16 walleye. $16 for walleye in 2019 is a hell of a deal, and while I figured it was probably pike-perch or something like that  I'll be damned if it wasn't the genuine article. The fillet was surprising hearty, had the right texture, the right flavor, and a nice light breading that clung to the meat really well. While a modicum of grease slid through the cracks, and a little more seasoning would definitively have been welcome, it's tough to complain about a real walleye fillet for $16. We did the curds before the fish (which were decent, but had a bunch of vacant batter shells), so I stuck with the fries over the plethora of other options. These spuds sticks were battered up, but beyond that, basically basic - think McDonald's-looking with a crispier coating. The tartar was was thick but forgettable and the slaw was colorful and creamy which made me happy. As so often happens in 2019 the bread was but an afterthought, but some cheddar-loaded hush puppies were yummy and filled the void for the most part. I'm human, and fairly or not, I judge things based on other's opinions and my own perception. It's something we all need to work on, and this visit to Boulder Brewpub only made me realize it even more. This was good walleye, and I'd gladly come back for it or to sample any other their other Friday offerings.

Well, we waited for a while (until Tanget was no longer the new kid on the block), and decided to give them their moment in the sun, well, at least as far as Fish Fry is concerned. This Friday the special was a $13 haddock which from sounds of it looks like it rotates from week to week. The two thin pieces were really good, but in all honesty the portion was a too conservative for my tastes. To their credit, the fish was smeared with a  light beer batter that was super flavorful. The paper it sat on was equally smeared with what appeared to be grease, but for the life of me I didn't taste a drop of it in the fish. Some fat julienne-cut fries (complete with skin) were simply excellent, and, unlike the fish, they came in droves. The Friday mantra: starve them on the fish, force feed them on the fries... The tartar had the look of a Parmesan peppercorn dressing, but the flavor was in the right spot. It was definitely made in-house, and a step up form the Sysco standard. Tanget is all hip and modern, and as a hip-mod place they don't serve bread with their Fish Fry. Curse those gluten-hatin' hipsters! Of course, there is still some slaw, and this dish was as unique as we've seen in a while. There was some broccoli in there and all sorts of other stuff too. It had a pleasant flavor and I ate 'er all. Tanget is an easy place to have high expectations of - new building, amazing location next to the even more amazing Sylvee (seriously if you haven't been to a show there check it out), and slick vibe. It's also an easy place to nit-pick, especially though growing pains, but I have to say the Fish Fry was downright decent despite the conservative potion of actual fish. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and will be back, maybe even on a show night since they apparently don't get all that swamped despite the omnipresent crowds... tangentmadison.com/803 E Washington AvenueMadison, WI 53703     (608) 819-6241",2060,0.20925002925002928,0.5429612729612732

""Why is God's name would you do that?"" they ask. Well, the answer is simple really, most of the best Fish Frys I've been to have been at places that are (way) off the beaten path. Add Easy Landing to that list.Easy Landing isn't a full blown supper club (it's too small for that), but it's not just a crossroads bar either (they have a real dining room complete with salad bar). I'd consider it a supper club lite - real food made by a real chef - far more than just a bar & grill. On Friday nights the Landing has a TON of options, including unique specials each week. This Friday there was grouper amongst all sorts of others, but I stuck to the standard printed menu, settling on the $15 bluegill which, like all the fish, comes complete with a romp through their concise salad bar. For being ""lite"" the salad bar had most of the supper club standards as well as a few options you won't see everywhere like fully intact hard boiled eggs. For the most part it was standard - iceberg lettuce, the divine trinity of salad dressings (French, Ranch, and Thousand Island), and the toppings you'd expect. The slaw was also on the salad bar, but was out of ordinary to say the least. Dotted with broccoli and other unexpected contributors, it was amongst the weirdest we've seen but not in a bad way. The dinner roll was King's Hawaiian straight out of the package...I even had to take the twist tie off a pull the first one out. I ate at the bar and the fish was fried and ready no more than 10 minutes after the order passed my lips. At first site, and then first bite I could tell these 'gills were nothing less than superb. There were around 14 fillets on the plate, and no, that's not and exaggeration. Each was kissed with a light breading that let the fish be all it could be. These were the tiny fillets you'd expect, so you know they were legit. I was loving them so much I even convinced the gentleman next to me to order the same for himself. The fish laid down the gauntlet, but the hash browns with cheese and onion were up to the challenge. These spuds were absolutely some of the best I've ever had. Like the fish there was just a ton of them, they were perfectly fried, and had a a gooey and slippery texture that was easy to fall in love with. <3 <3 <3 Supper club lites can apparently still get their mitts on classic big boy supper club tartar and the sauce at the Landing was easy on the eyes and taste buds. It was a bold and creamy people pleaser, and perked this fish up just enough. Sure, downtown Madison is great and has it's share of decent Fish Frys, but I guarantee you you'll never find a $15 plate with 14+ bluegill on it within 5 miles of our beloved Capitol. And that's not to mention the massive sides and full salad bar that comes along with it.

Frankenstein. The Mummy. The Old Rock Fish Fry. All monsters. And all awesome.I heard about the Old Rock through the old social media grapevine. It's a country bar outside of Columbus in what is technically Astico. Rumor had it they had a mean old Fish Fry, but I wasn't fully expecting the monstrosity I would endure. The Rock serves cod on Fridays and it comes as a 2,3,4-piece or All You Can Eat. Being fearful of the AYCE unknown, I went full four on this bad boy since I figured, if nothing else, I could take a piece home. It was the frugal decision...or so I thought. The 4-piece goes for $15, which is actually pretty reasonable considering how beastly each piece is. They're basically 4 oz. each which results in roughly a full pound of fish. This fish isn't junk either. It's high quality cod that's stark white and flaky as can be then coated with a light and scrumptious breading. This breading also isn't just straight flower as there is dill and all sorts of other goodies plainly visible even after frying. What appear to be house-cut fries come with the fish and there are a terrifying amount of them. Some thick and creamy tartar will spook the bejesus out of the faint of heart, a zesty slaw will perk up those timid taste buds, and the Rock's thick-cut pumpernickel rye creep up on any unsuspecting victims with its stank. People often question why I'd go to Milford, Astico, or any of these other bumf*ck towns for fish when there are perfectly good places right up there street? My only answer is fear. Fear of missing out. Fear of the unknown. Fear of not finding the monsters. The Old Rock is one of those beasts that I'm glad I took the time to find. It's definitely worth the price AND worth the drive.

The $20 AYCE is the super special at the revamped Roxbury Bar & Grill, and the second I heard it I knew where I'd be the upcoming Friday.You see, I LOVE bluegill, and that's love with a capital ""L"". It's probably my favorite Fish Fry fish, and it rarely (if ever) comes AYCE. In fact, I don't know that I've EVER seen it that way and I knew I could eat a ton of them if given the chance. I'd also wanted to visit the Roxbury Bar & Grill forever, but under the previous ownership it was always weird. One week they'd have fish, the next they wouldn't, then they would, then they wouldn't. I basically just gave up on them and washed my hands of it deciding that if I was driving to Roxbury, I was driving to the Dorf Haus and that was that. The AYCE 'gill a the bar might have just given me another legitimate reason to drive that far. The RBG FF starts at 5:00 and I was parked on a stool at 4:30 in anticipation. Of course, when 5:00 hit my order was in and the game was afoot. The first round (or the normal ""1/2 lb"" portion) is comprised of five fillets (which I can't believe total anywhere near a half pound). The fish is dredged in a flour-forward breading that has minimal flavor but lets the fish do its thing, and that is a thing bluegill does well. The subtle fishy flavor took hold and never let go. It was a masterpiece especially when slathered with the grills thick and creamy tartar. Rounds 2, 3, 4, and 5 were more of the same, with three more fillets coming per re-orders. All re-orders go in line behind any initial orders, so if you think you're fish will come right away you might be in for a bit of a surprise, and might want to get that re-order in right away. A small bowl of cheesy potatoes come with the fish and are pretty superb all things considered. Of course, you'd love to have more of them with subsequent orders of fish, but that's rarely, if ever, how these things work. Every other part of this Fish Fry is pretty much standard; the roll is a roll, and the creamy slaw is in the basic zone. That's that. AYCE bluegill is almost unheard of and while I think it's a spectacular gimmick for them, I have to imagine it's unsustainable. I'd recommend going quick before that figure that out. Of course, once they do there is still the regular version out there and they do have a 2 or 3-piece haddock available. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and think even at $20 it's a good deal, especially if you're willing to sit there for 18 pieces like I was. www.facebook.com/theroxburybarandgrill/8901 County Hwy YSauk City, WI 53583     (608) 643-8434",2686,0.12085434173669467,0.5331983049630108

It had to be a daunting few months, but they somehow made it through and I figured that after weathering that storm the place would be packed ever after. We showed up early this Friday for their Fish Fry expecting the place to fill up within minutes...Oddly, that expectation was never met. There were literally the same amount of people there when we left around 6:00 as when we arrived around 4:30 - 0. It was very strange to see since the Fox looks like the kind of place and has the kind of menu that should be drawing diners in like bees to honey. We showed up for the traditional cod or haddock (they have both on Fridays), but were pleasantly surprised to see smelt in place of the latter. Apparently the haddock boat didn't come in so a $13 smelt plate was substituted...and I jumped on it. Since our son was with, and also since I flat out like them, we got a round of the curbs as an app. These have to be some of the most unique curds we've ever come across. They are pancake battered, and while that sounds daunting, and the maple syrup drizzle just sounds weird, these had to be some of the tastiest curds we've ever had. For $10 they are up there price-wise, but by God, they might actually have been worth it. They were rich and decadent, and the sticky syrup worked surprisingly well with the mild cheese. While I was surprised at how much I actually liked them, MFF Junior said that he thought they were the best he's ever had and the kid doesn't even like pancakes!!! And here I thought he'd take one bite and spit them back out... The beer battered smelt came just as we polished off the gooey curds and looked great. While I'd normally shy away from beer battering smelt, this bubbly batter was as light as can be and allowed any grease to leak away from the fish before being served. As expected, the smelt were super fishy, and actually offset nicely by the batter. Like the crazy curds, it was almost miraculous in a way and had me happily munching away at the 14 or so pieces on the plate. Lots and lots of thin house-cut fries sat shotgun and felt like they'd never run out. These superb spuds were pure munching pleasure and I gleefully took them down without hesitation. A caper-loaded tartar should have been a turnoff, but like the beer battered smelt, and syrup smeared curds before it, it'll surprise ya. It was thick, rich, and balanced, and offset the fishiness of the smelt fantastically. So many places are phasing out the bread (I'll never understand why) and the Tinner is one of them. Luckily, a house slaw totally overshadowed that fact with its crazy Dijon base and crisp cabbage texture. I mean, who makes slaw like this? And more so, how is it delicious? The Tin Fox is crazy! There was so much going on at with the Tin Fox Fish Fry that it should have been a huge disaster. The place was dead...like D.E.A.D. dead at 4:30 on a Friday. The curds were crazy, the smelt was beer battered, the slaw was bizarre, and on it goes... None of this should have worked, but by some miracle, or maybe just awesome chef-fing, it all came together better than we ever could have imagined. Overall, we actually highly recommend this Fish Fry and think they need to keep it up.

Prior to the turn of the decade SP was essentially a Fish Fry wasteland. Beyond Herreman's Supper Club there was basically no reason to take the 15 minutes drive east on a Friday. Sure, there were a couple spots serving fish, but nothing you'd want to try more than once. Buck & Honey's changed all that, and their new location in Monona is primed to do the same thing for that area.The new B&H is right on the Yahara on the ground floor of a fancy new high rise condo development. Only open a short time, they seemingly have already hit their stride and are drawing a crowd rivaling that of the original location. We showed up at 4:30 this Friday and people were already pouring in - some for dinner and some just for a drink at their super cool birch bar (look it up). There are numerous fish specials on the Friday menu, but the only traditional version is the $15 3-piece cod. Some of the others are indeed fried, but go beyond the ordinary - think sweet chili drizzled lake perch and such. Needless to say, I stuck to tradition. The traditional cod was everything it was cracked up to be too. The three pieces were very hearty, coming in at a good 3-4 oz each. Despite their mass, and their beer batter, the loins remain light and don't make you feel like you gorged on a pound of fish afterwards. Light and flaky is the name of this game, both in fish and batter. It's clearly the utmost quality cod and balanced through and through. B&H does house-cut fries, but the de facto side with the fish is the cheesy hash browns. These spud squares are conservatively portioned, but what is there is extremely satisfying. They're not overly gooey, but rich in their own way, and while I think you can sub the fries I'd stick with the standard spud if I were you. A thick and lovely tartar must have been made in-house, as it almost had a marbled appearance. It's wasn't over-mixed, but was a good one and the perfect accompaniment for the fish. Staying with the cream theme was a massive scoop of slaw. This smooth operator did its job and stuck around until the end. A soft, split-top roll was a step above grandma's dinner roll but a small step at that. The original Buck & Honey's put Sun Prairie on the Fish Fry map, and while Monona is already there to some extent (thanks to places like the Silver Eagle) the new location might just bump the 'burb into a new classification. The aesthetic is outstanding, from the aforementioned birches behind the bar to the patio along the Yahara; they did this one right. The Fish Fry is also done right, and certainly one we'll be back for soon. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and think the place is as sweet as, well, honey...  www.buckandhoneys.com/800 W Broadway Suite 300Monona, WI 53713     (608) 478-2618",2839,0.15962616479565633,0.5508429329615769

My family has done business with them over the years, and their son and daughter-in-law are personal friends of my wife and I. That being said, I don't think I'm biased when I say this is a darn good Fish Fry.For starters, KC has a bunch of options on Fridays. From cod to catfish, and walleye to bluegill, there is something for everyone. Since I was feeling fresh this Friday I settled on the bluegill, while my mom went walleye, and dad chose catfish. It was a perfect storm since I knew I'd get to sample a good 3/4 of the menu. The bluegill goes for $15 on Fridays ($17 the rest of the week), which isn't cheap for rural Wisconsin, but more than fair when taken in the context of the state as a whole. Before diners catch sight of the fish some crunchy little garlic toasts and an intensely salty cheese dip crest the horizon and serve as a lovely little unexpected appetizer. Six or so fillets make up the bluegill plate, and my sextet was composed of two tiny ""chips"" and four fat supple ones. The light batter was essentially just there as an accompaniment, as there wasn't any pronounced flavor to it. Luckily, that's alright when you're talking about bluegill since it gives the subtle fishy flavors a chance to sing. The ""chips"" as I referred to them were super thin and crispy, while the large fillets were meaty enough to make up from tiny twins shortcomings. All were presumably fried for the same duration which is likely why the large ones were juicy and the small ones dried up a bit. A nice handful of skin-on fries were right in the zone, while the super thick supper club style tartar bolstered the already admirable bluegill. Grandma's dinner roll got a little smooshed but it was still fresh and soft; and although it was a little soupy, the slaw was still satisfying. In all honesty I've been let down with the Fish Frys around my hometown recently. They've ranged from inconsistent to downright bad, but this was a breath of fresh air. The bluegill was good, and the reports were also positive on the beer battered catfish and walleye - I enjoyed them on sandwiches the next day so I presume they were even better freshly fried. Sure, $15 for a Fish Fry in Readstown might seem expensive to some, but, believe it or not, bluegill is a premium fish in this day and age and the Creekside is a nicer than average joint so they're going to have slightly higher than average prices. That's just the way it works. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and will camp out at the Creekside again soon I'm sure. kickapoocreekside.com/menu 827 W Kickapoo StreetReadstown, WI 54652     (608) 629-5565",2735,0.15443279916964125,0.5568124857598542

Lots of ""houses"" as a matter of fact. You have the casual dockside Boathouse, the cool underground Icehouse, the swanky Statehouse, and then Augie's Tavern. Apparently Augie is still renting...at least he's still got enough space to make a mean batch of curds though. Interestingly enough all four offer some sort of Fish Fry on Fridays (and other days of the week for that matter) and to this point we'd sampled the two lesser houses to varying degrees of enjoyment.For starters, the Fry at the Icehouse happens during the winter months when the skating rink is open, and is simply deplorable; I'll leave it at that. The Boathouse is markedly better, but still nothing to write home about. I had high hopes for the Statehouse since 1) it's the flagship restaurant of the bunch and 2) based on the Edgewater's website, they take the FFF seriously. Oh joy, I thought. The classic Wisconsin Fish Fry is cod and runs $17. While I was hoping for the lake perch listed in the on-line menu, the only version of perch this Friday was a fancy one (not your typical Fry). Turns out the $21 cornmeal-dusted classic only ran through April and I'd neglected to notice that timeline. Bah. Still $17 for cod at a upscale restaurant isn't unexpected so we rolled with it. We showed up around 4:30 only to learn dinner service doesn't start until 5:30. It gave us some time to enjoy the terrace and take in some live music which wound up being a welcome break in our day. When the time came we were literally the first group of the night and got a table near the window with a spectacular view overlooking the lake. +1! The service was on point and we had our food mere minutes after our orders went in. At first blush the cod appeared hearty, and it was. While only two pieces come to the portion they are larger than average and sheathed in a skin-like beer batter. The darkish coating was right in the zone - not too thick and not too thin - with a rich flavor. Despite having a late lunch and crushing curds from Augie's beforehand I ate it all with ease. The menu claims the fries are house-cut, but these didn't seem to be. They were the skin-on Julienne-cuts and very uniform in size. They definitively had the look and texture of the typical food service fry. Maybe I'm wrong on that, but I've eaten a lot of fries over the years and if they are indeed house-cut they do a fine job of filtering out the nubs and oddjobs. Moreover, they were perfectly fried with satisfying crunchy exteriors and pillowy centers which is tough to do with freshly cut fries. A tiny bit o’ slaw sat in a standard stainless ramekin, and was very good, but literally 3 bites...and those were conservative bites for a big mouth like me. A twin cup of thick and creamy tartar sat alongside it, and had a pleasant pungent punch. This was definitively not the run of the mill Sysco sauce. It amped up the cod, but ran short before the second piece was even gone. Rye is stated in the description and shown in the picture on-line, so of course I was bummed when none came with my order. I probably could have asked for some, but got lost in the views, and the exploits of a five year old that didn't care for his fancy mac-n-cheese. $17 may seem like a lot to pay for a couple pieces of cod, but you have to remember where you are. This is a high quality Fish Fry at a very nice place. You're paying for the views and the caché of the Edgewater to some extent so you have to figure that in as well. Overall, we still recommend this Fish Fry, and I would like to eat it again, but probably won't make a point of coming back for it. It was a fun experience, and we're happy to have done it, but in all honesty I liked the cod I had for lunch at Brennan's more. www.theedgewater.com/dining-at-the-edgewater/the-statehouse/1001 Wisconsin AvenueMadison, WI 53703     (608) 535-8230",3912,0.14201060051060052,0.5580750915750916

They were unicorns in a field of domestic macro lagers and imported ales, and those that existed did so on the fringes. The Great Dane, Vintage, Capital, New Glarus, Ale Asylum, Karben4 and those like them carved out a niche by drawing loyal cult followings; hell, I was a Spotted Cow man for years. Over the last half decade or so these mythical beasts and their nano counterparts have stepped out of the shadows and truly given the macros a run for their money. Madison's newest entry into the micro universe comes in the form of Union Corners Brewing in the brand new Union Corners Development.Those who have been in Madison for a while know that Union Corners needed something like this badly. The area sat vacant for years without a definitive plan, or reason for anyone to go there. It was a big empty lot at the junction of two major arteries in East Wash and Milwaukee - a beacon for street crime and other nefarious activities. Since upscale breweries are all the rage, a brewery with good food, including a true blue Fish Fry, was just what the doctor ordered. The Fish Fry on the corner is Lake Superior Whitefish or Alaskan Pollack for $13.50, and there was no way I was touching the neighbor to the Arctic north. My disdain for Pollack is well noted... In all honesty, I was skeptical of the whitefish as well, but I have to say UC quashed those concerns.The 3-piece whitefish was surprisingly good and likely the best whitefish I’ve ever had; I'm not even joking. It wasn't slimy like most whitefish I've encountered, and comes kissed with a light and crunchy cornmeal breading. There was almost no grease to speak of, which is impressive for whitefish since, like I say, it's not the best deep frying fish. It was borderline excellent, but all that said, I can only imagine how much better a nice hunk of buttery cod would be in this style. There are a couple potato options to choose form (neither of which are French fries), and the “pommes” as they're referred to were spectacular. The were spot-on and quite possibly the best mashed potatoes I’ve ever had. Sorry, Mom, but it's true. The tartar was also commendable, and perked the fish up ever so slightly. In addition to is yummy flavor, it came in a fantastic biodegradable cup which didn't leak, didn't get soggy, and won't be sitting in some landfill for the next 100,000 years. Bravo! I hope more places catch on to this one and I have no qualms about doling out some extra credit for it! Coleslaw can be an afterthought at the typical Fish Fry, but Union Corners put their thinking caps on for this one. It was as unique as they come; sweet and savory at the same time and popped with plenty of fennel. Yes, fennel. It sounds weird, but by god, it worked. And worked in the best of ways. The only real detractor to this Fish Fry was the fact there was no bread served, but in all honesty we're getting used to it in the anti-gluten twenty-teens. Madison has a ton of desirable breweries all of a sudden; from One Barrel, Next Door, ALT, Working Draft and Giant Jones on the near east side, to Rockhound downtown, Funk Factory and Delta Beer Lab on the south side, and Octopi and Lone Girl out in Waunakee, a legitimate beer scene has erupted. Union Corners Brewing is yet another great addition to that ever growing list. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and Union Corners in general. It's a real draw, and just what a once blighted corner needed. www.unioncornersbrewery.com2438 Winnebago StreetMadison, WI 53704     (608) 709-1406",3554,0.2315292758089368,0.5343348741653826

Truth be told, I always wanted to try Monks, but for whatever reason just never took the plunge. Finally I just had to say enough with it, and bite the bullet. Turns out, Im glad I did.Even though The Monks Retreat isnt exactly known as a vegetarian friendly spot, I somehow managed to convince my wife that she would find something she liked. I crossed my fingers, and met her in Cross Plains at 12 oclock on-the-dot. We were two of the first three patrons in the tiny bar this Friday afternoon, so we just took the two stools nearest the door and waited. The friendly bartender poked her head out of the kitchen and spotted us a second or two later, and when she swung by, I ordered a beer, and the wife some h2o. When she came back with the beverages I inquired about the Whitefish and the little lady about the Portobello Sandwich (which is no longer available, by the way). Satisfied with her explanation, I ordered myself the Dinner plate and m lady settled on the Caesar Salad.Before the nine dollar and fifty cent plate of fish I was treated to some homemade slaw and a warm roll. The roll was one of those little football-shaped ones, which, while not out of this world, was soft and improved tenfold by the simple act of heating. While the roll was good for what it was, the slaw was even better at its job. It was clearly homemade and a obvious sign of pride for the establishment (apparently they have heard time and again that it is the best slaw ever). While I very much enjoyed the vinegary mix of fresh cabbage, carrots, and some sunflower seeds, Im not sure Id call it the best, but its certainly up there.The Alaskan Whitefish came a short time after the salad course and was scalding hot when served. The four mid-sized pieces had a light golden beer batter which got a little greasy, but not overly so. Now, Im not sure if Monks actually uses the species known as Alaska Whitefish or just one of the  commercial species  (Cod, Halibut, Sole, Pollack) classified under the same name, but whichever it is, the choice is good.  The fish was extremely smooth, but had almost no inherent flavor of its own. Thus, it was an ideal canvass for The Monks flavorful beer batter. The fish was flaky and actually quite cod-like, only with not so rich of a taste. While the fish/batter combo produced some grease it wasnt nasty tasting, and one one-time rotation was adequate - although last piece was pushing sogginess.Partnering with the mystery fish was a side of hash browns with cheese and onion which were awesome. They featured a two-cheese blend, big onion chunks, and perfectly crispy exteriors. They were in a word, fantastic. The tartar was also extremely good as the mayo-heavy mix overcame the fishs greasy excretions with a noticeable pop, and thick texture.The Monks Retreat is cool place. I could tell from the second I walked in that I was going to like it, and they came through with flying colors. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and will be back again before long. The place is small, and I bet it gets pretty cramped on a Friday night, but wedge yourself in, grab a brew, and enjoy the pleasantries this small town tavern has to offer.

We came twice, we left satisfied. We came a third time, we left devastated. What happened, Schneids? Your fish which was once so flaky and moist, is now the furthest thing from it. Your service which was once so friendly, is almost non-existent now. Your precipitous decline has left us at a loss without much to say, but well try anyway. Perhaps your lackluster performance can be attributed to our party of six which it seemed you were unprepared for. Some places handle these kinds of numbers with grace, but apparently we got one over on you. When more than a couple three folks show up all hell breaks loose? Thats too bad. Our sextet mixed and mingled with your fish, some ordered cod, some ocean perch. The perch came first, and was hot, we will give you that (and that alone). The poor perchers were made to suffer through 3 large pieces of over-fried, tough, fish without much to hang its hat on. The cod chompers (myself included) fared better as the pair of pieces housed a nice, light breading, and were fried much better than their counterpart. While there was a little grease it could have been much worse, and the cod was still fairly flaky despite the oily presence.Since we were the first fishers to arrive we got one of your big squeeze bottles of tartar fresh from the fridge so it was nice and cold. It was thick and creamy, with just the right amount of relish. It paired well with the cod, but even its succulence couldnt cure your problematic perch. The pre-packaged roll you furnished wasnt stale or anything, but wasnt anything special either. Your stinky slaw was even worse with no flavor to speak of. We pretty much all sampled it then set it aside. No zing, no nothing, no love for your slaw. Straight from the freezer to the fryer, your crinkle fries didnt inspire. My portion was tiny as were the pieces that comprised it. The crinkle-cut calamity was nothing but over-fried scraps and nubbins, with barely a full-sized fry among them. Everyone seemed to agree even though they at least had full-sized fries.  Color me disappointed.Overall, there is no way we can recommend your Fish Fry any more. Over-fried perch, lackluster sides, and indifferent waitresses are just not what we are looking for at this point. Sorry, Schneids.

Now that I had a mental picture of the place I knew I could put it off no longer.We arrived at Schneid’s just before 1 o’clock and took one of the many open tables in the dining area away from the bar. Schneid’s is definitely a bar, complete with old school wood paneling, a cigarette machine, retro dinnerware and a punchy older waitress to match. She stopped by with a couple menus and took our drink orders. On Fridays Schneid’s has Cod and Ocean Perch on special and since there were two of us we got one of each. I figured both would be good because on the way in I noticed that someone who appeared to be the owner was manning the fryer and usually ownership takes the most pride in their food.We got our drinks lickety-split along with a side of coleslaw and some plain looking bread. As we sat back and enjoyed them we actually heard the fish drop into the hot fryer. You could almost hear the perch yelp as their fragile little bodies hit the scalding hot oil. It sounded marvelous. About 5 minutes later the food was in front us and unimaginably hot. The Ocean Perch was nothing less than outstanding. It was light and flaky with an almost perfect texture. It really almost melted in your mouth. It enjoyed a light batter which was tasty and stayed together very well. Unlike the Esquire Club or the Stamm House that serve smaller, crispier Ocean Perch, Schneid’s Perch were 3 big filets which made me wonder if it wasn’t actually Lake Perch. It was really good either way. The Cod was also good. It had a similar batter to the Perch but just was not as flavorful. However, if the Perch was not available I certainly would not hesitate to recommend the Cod.The tartar sauce was awaiting our arrival at the table and was very good and more than plentiful. It worked well with their fish. The crinkle cut fries were also abundant and played their supporting roll well enough. The fish is what shined in this Fish Fry and that is just how it should be.Overall I was very impressed with Schneid’s. The fish was delicious, the fries and tarter did their jobs, and rest of it was what it needed to be. Schneid’s may not be the classiest looking place, and if you don’t like cigarette smoke you might have to skip this one, but Schneid’s has done Fish Fry right. This is a classic case of “do not judge a book by its cover,” the best Fish Fry can show up where you least suspect it. Oh yeah, did I mention it was only $6.50? That is a seriously good value. 2952 Fish Hatchery RoadFitchburg, WI 53719     (608) 271-3644",2984,0.2653766360345307,0.5166012252854358

Instead of having the same old, same old on the East Side, I ventured towards the square. There I found a couple friends, and The Argus Bar & Grill.On Fridays the Argus offers up a Fish Fry special for lunch that is not on the everyday menu. It consists of two pieces of fried cod, with homemade French fries and coleslaw for $6.50. The portion size is not huge but is fairly appropriate for a lunch.The cod was decent but not great, I believe it is the exact same fish they serve at the Glass Nickel on a daily basis. The fish itself is good but the batter they use seemed very polarizing, people either loved it or hated it. It is a very firm batter that forms a “shell” over the surface of the fish which makes it difficult to cut with a fork. However, if you are a true Fish fry lover and grab it up with your hands, the extremely stable batter works in your favor. Depending on what you are in to you may love this kind of fish or hate it, personally I like my batter lighter and flakier.The French fries were homemade and quite delicious, although fairly scarce. They reminded me somewhat of “Hub’s Fries” that I used to get at the county fair when I was little, although they were not quite that good. “Hub’s Fries” are a 10; these were about an 8, which is still pretty good. The coleslaw also looked homemade and was good. The tartar sauce was just fine although it took our waitress a little bit to get everyone at our table a round. There was no bread served which was kind of a let down.Overall this Fish fry was decent but not great. It is almost recommendable but not quite. The fish just didn’t do it for me. Probably partially because it is so similar to The Nickel and I stopped getting it there for a reason, there are simply better alternatives. The Argus shined on periphery items and if they gave you some kind of bread with lunch it would certainly help. As it stands the Argus is okay, but I can think of other places downtown I would recommend first if someone were to ask.123 E Main StreetMadison, WI 53703     (608) 256-4226",2161,0.15390567765567764,0.5271703296703296

While I pretty much remember elements of each and every Fish Fry, there are times when Ill read an old review and it will trigger a more poignant memory of the experience. Usually it is something funny uttered by a friend, or whatever happened to be on the TV in the bar, rarely, if ever, is it about the actual food. After all, eating is a necessity, but spending time with your friends is the true spice of life. Hell, that is how we happened to fall into this racket in the first place - relaxing on Friday night with our friend Gabe, and hitting up the supper club for a good Fish Fry after a long week at work. It just so happened that some of Gabe and Is friends were in town, and when this crew blows in they like to spend extended hours in the Union Terrace/State Street area. Since they were downtown anyway, and I recently heard the Orpheum had changed up their fish offering, I knew what needed to be done. Before I could even get a hold of the gang, Gabe sent me a text, and set the plan in motion: Orpheum ASAP, it said. Since the crew was already on State, I busted ass to get down there as quickly as possible. It just so happened that my haste was unnecessary as the wait at the Orpheum (san-reservation) easily gave me enough time to join them and enjoy a Spotted Cow before the meal. As we all stood around the bar we kept noticing that a large table had opened up and been setup for more diners. This had to be us, we all thought. The wait staff was running around like a bunch of chickens with their heads cut off, so we had no idea if it was indeed ours or not, but waited patiently for the girl to come over and confirm it. Roughly 30 minutes after I showed up (and 1.25 hours after the reservation was made) we were finally seated. At this point we were all drenched in hunger and more than ready to get this AYCE rolling. As the waitress made her way around the table it was clear that most of these good ol Wisco folks had shown up for the $14 AYCE lake perch. Out of the 12 in the group, almost everyone put in for the special which made her job a bit easier. A couple of the Fish Fry faithful also ordered the potato pancakes which are served as an appetizer, but are not available as a side option for the Fish Fry (boo). Once the orders went in, about 15 minutes or so passed before the first belt of fish hit the table. Luckily for me, mine was in this clique. Usually if I am in a big group like this I will wait until everyone has their food before imbibing, but this is a Fish Fry, and time must not be wasted. I dove right in, grabbed a hunk of perch, and plunged it waist deep into the tartar. At first bite it was clear, this lake perch is great. It was extremely delicate and flaky while being coated in a flavorful, crispy batter. The first plateful of six fillets was nowhere near enough to handle my appetite and I quickly re-upped. The second helping contained three more of the freshwater beauties, which were equally good, if not even a little better than their predecessors.While the perch was plentiful and delicious, its pal the tartar sauce was equally plentiful, but not equally delicious. For some reason (perhaps popular demand, but I doubt it) they have reverted to the ultra-dilly sauce of yesteryear. While it doesnt taste awful per se, the ranch-y mix does little to help the fish which actually probably tasted better without it. As far as sides go, the Orpheum is apparently pro-America and doesnt give a French fry option. The American fries they do serve were surprisingly good, especially since I am not a huge fan of the home-style potatoes. The potato pancakes, which I also got to try, were much better and would be a phenomenal addition as a side choice. As it is, they are a standalone appetizer, which is nice, but when Im already spending  $14 on the AYCE Fish Fry I dont really want to add on a $6 appetizer, you know?You figure that since you are dropping a decent amount of coin they would at least throw a slice or two of bread in there, but for some reason the Orpheum has neglected this very basic Fish Fry staple. The raw cabbage coleslaw certainly didnt make up any ground, as the stuff was flat out not tasty. I did eat a good portion of it, but almost begrudgingly as I waited for more of the AYCE fish to appear. In general, the service at the Orpheum is spot-on, but for whatever reason, they were out of their element on this visit. I mentioned the excruciating wait above, but once we were seated things didnt get much better. Sure we had a large party, but that is no excuse for bringing the kids food last (we had two little ones with us) AND forgetting the veggie dish on the plate warmer altogether. She did do an admirable job of making sure the AYCErs were satisfied, so I will give her credit there, but by and large, the service was below average.  A graph of this Fish Fry would look something like the stock market circa 2008. The fish itself was above reproach, and would constitute the peak of the curve. The negative slope would then begin as you move down the x-axis to the potatoes which were not bad, but certainly not on the same level of the perch. From here, a precipitous decline would ensue as the dilly tartar sauce would indicate the collapse in the market. This free fall would be followed by the raw slaw further down the curve which would finally bottom out with the complete lack of bread. The hit-and-miss service would be finishing touch and signify the depth of the recession and how bad it has really gotten. Even with all the shortcomings this is still a recommendable Fish Fry, and I have to imagine if we had a group of two instead of 12 things would have gone much smoother service-wise. The Orpheum is a great place and they are really trying to step-up the Fish Fry game, which I can totally appreciate, even if there is a misstep here and there. Thankfully, we had enough people around to keep the night lively and interesting, even with some delays in the action. Overall, we still had a pleasant experience and enjoyed some good fish in the company of some good friends, which is really what the Fish Fry experience is all about when all is said and done. madisonorpheum.com/216 State StreetMadison, WI 53703     (608) 255-6005",6414,0.16264375868034406,0.4941658725195311

I have been to a lot of movies and concerts at the theater over the years and never been disappointed. I tried the fish fry and a while ago and really enjoyed it as well, I even declared their Bluegills to be the best in the city. Since it had been almost a year since the last visit we decided it was about time for a return.The Fish Fry is not the cheapest you are going to find ($14.50) but the atmosphere and the fact that it is AYCE help make it worth the cost. The Bluegills were not quite what I remembered from our previous visit. The batter seemed much thicker and less crispy. It was incredibly rich, which was not bad, but did not leave much room for the flavor of the Bluegills underneath. The overall flavor of the fish was good, but a little too creamy and rich for my tastes. Nevertheless, I did manage to eat my full plate, plus two and a half additional pieces.The American Fries served in lieu of French fries were good as well, but didn’t knock my socks off by any means. The coleslaw was actually pretty decent, kind of ‘stanky’ but very edible, and I usually don’t touch the stuff. The bread was not that great, it wasn’t warm when we got it which probably detracted from the taste quite a bit. The highlight of the evening may have been that they have moved on from the ‘dilly’ tartar sauce they used to have to a more traditional style. It was still not perfect but much better.The Orpheum is one of the few places that actually accepts (and honors) reservations on Friday nights. We either did not know this, or had forgotten it at some point and didn’t have one. Regardless we got a table within 10 minutes and were in and out of the place in about an hour. The service at the Orpheum is good, partially due to the fact that it is a more ‘upscale’ establishment than your classic Wisconsin supper club. The Fish Fry is good overall but is not quite good enough to be considered with the best. I would recommend it though because the atmosphere is great, the fish is plentiful and the service is good.madisonorpheum.com/216 State StreetMadison, WI 53703     (608) 255-6005",2134,0.2550189393939394,0.4407196969696971

For those of you that don't: DO NOT GO TO TOBY'S ON A FRIDAY NIGHT! YOU WILL NOT BE HAPPY! Instead, you could just go to Toby's for lunch on Friday and get the same great fish without having to fight the crowds (like I do). You do have options...Don't get me wrong, I'm a hustle and bustle kind of guy, but when I'm out with a child the friendly confines of a dimly lit Toby's after 4pm on a Friday are nowhere near as appealing. I can't imagine standing around the bar with a little one...so I don't. I get my bluegill fix at lunch time and when I realized it had been almost a year since I'd done so I remedied that situation. The lunch potion came with seven fillets this Friday and the school was all huddled up on the south side of the basket. Each was lightly breaded such that the skin still showed through on the underside (how it should be). They were perfectly fried without and hint of grease and the most subtle, yet alluring fishy flavor. Bluegill is all about the essence and this stuff has serious swagger. It's some of the best in the game to be sure. Toby's is known for their hash browns with cheese and onion, and while an edge on my disc got a little overdone it didn't detract from the the overall excellence. Those dark spots were easily trimmed away and the resultant gooey goodness got gobbled up. Toby's tartar is also a show stopper and the sweet, thick, zippy, peppy, tangy, tartar slipped and slid all over the surface of the sunfish making it something more...something out-of-this-world. A little crescent roll was a pleasant surprise as it stood in for the usual slab of French bread. Toby's isn't afraid to change the small things up which suits me just fine as the French can get a little stale (no pun intended). Toby's house slaw also waffles from sugary sweet, to strictly creamy, but is always finely-chopped and plentiful. Today was a strictly creamy day, and it was a little less alluring but still perfectly palatable. I'll reiterate, if you don't like crowds DO NOT GO TO TOBY'S ON FRIDAY NIGHT. If however you like to have a drink or two, shoot the breeze, and kick off your weekend in style swing by the supper club, I'm sue they'd be happy to see you. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry whether in the daytime or the night. The fish is just too damn good not to. www.tobyssupperclub.com/Tobys_Supper_Club/Home.html3717 S Dutch Mill RoadMadison, WI 53718     (608) 222-6913",2511,0.1716111111111111,0.5369382716049382

The good mostly revolves around the quality food at a great price, while the not-so-good centers on the crowds, the impatient bartenders, and the ambiance of the old building. While I personally love the hustle and bustle of Friday nights, and the dark low ceilings, I can appreciate the concerns others have; and since we roll with a four year old these days we avoid the dinner rush at this point opting instead for lunch-hour meal on South Dutch Mill Road.This was a cod Friday and the $12 3-piece with all the usual sides is sure to satisfy. Toby's cod is pristine, and apparently of the highest quality. The fish flakes apart effortlessly into thick juicy planks that have a light and smooth flavor. They are perfectly complimented by Toby's light and flaky breading that sloughs off readily and necessitates a fork at times. It's a superb rendition and some of the best cod you will find anywhere. For us the potato of choice in the hash browns (with cheese and onion), although the steak fries are exceptional as well. The onions come embedded in the circular hash-o-loaf while the slice of American is placed on top allowing it settle, but not melt entirely. Only upon mixing is the cheese fully melded with it's spudly supporter. Toby's is a supper club and as such you'd expect a thick and creamy tartar and that's exactly what they deliver. The potent goo puts the proverbial icing on the cod cake and takes the fish from delectable to divine. A nice soft roll stood in for the standard slice of French bread today, and while we can't say it's a permanent switch it would be fine with us if it was. The slaw was also a little different - lacking the sugar rush we've become accustomed to - but we were alright with that as the finely-chopped mix still struck the right balance. And of course, the single serving of Schoep's ice cream at the end tops everything off and is a bonus you don't find anywhere else. I mean, free dessert? Who else is doing that? We've heard it all before and we're sure we'll hear it again, but regardless what some of the dissenters say we love the Fish Fry at Toby's.

So, let's start this one with their bluegill and end it with with their cod. Toby's doesn't serve bluegill for dinner on Fridays so you either have to get it for lunch, or dinner on a different day of the week. We were there for lunch this Friday so it was available and we couldn't pass it up. The bluegill was everything it's cracked up to be. The 10 fillets were petite and lightly breaded. They had a simply great taste without any overtly fishy flavors. The side of hash browns with cheese and onion were also crackerjack with crispy edges and slick, supple interiors. The slice of melting American on top may seem lowbrow to some, but is actually quite appropriate for those who are real fans. The big, bold supper club tartar really set the bluegill off, but the slaw missed the mark. While normally sugary and sweet, this batch was dry and flavorless. The slice of French was also so-so, but the single serve of Schoep's vanilla saved the day. A few days later we showed up for dinner and decided to get the 2-piece cod special instead. The cod was incredibly light and flaky with a fall-off-thin breading that sat well in the belly. Keeping with the change-it-up mantra was a side of steak fries. These spuds were chunky and crunchy and came in a big pile that most would cower beneath. They, like both styles of fish before them, paired well with the big, bold supper club tartar. When dinner rolls around the menu, as well as the choice of sides, expands and I went for a basic salad instead of the soup or slaw. The cod for dinner came with rolls instead of French bread, and cinnamon rolls instead of ice cream. Dinner also comes with a full relish tray with tons of cellophane sticks.

I told myself I was going to get cod this time around since I haven't had it forever and it sounded good, but once I saw those gillys on the board, for a mere $11 no less, I just couldn't help myself...I know, I'm weak. The eight fillets fried in the blink of an eye and came out of the kitchen steaming hot. These buggers were as plush as they come, and had no fishy flavor whatsoever despite the skin that shone through the paper-thin breading. Not only did the breading have a light texture, it was a little light on the seasoning as well. A bit more salt in the mix would certainly set things off but I'm really splitting hairs here. This stuff is great any way you slice it. Usually my hankering for Toby's hash browns can't be denied, but today I wanted the steak fries and stuck to my guns on that one. These babies have a satisfying crunch and come in droves so there is no danger of running out before the fish does. Toby's perfect supper club tartar is also as pleasing as the come and really caps the fish off with a bang. The slice of French bread on the side was meh, and the finely-chopped slaw was missing its sugary goodness, making both merely placeholders. Luckily, dessert is always included with your meal at Toby's and the single serving of Schoep's vanilla made dad and junior plenty happy. If you've never been to Toby's be sure to ""check in"" at the bar first. If the sun is up they'll just tell you to take a table, but if you're in at night be prepared to grab a drink, place your order, and wait for your table to be ready. That's just the way it works, and if you don't like it, there are plenty of others that do. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and will keep coming back during daylight hours until we can stomach the alternative. www.tobyssupperclub.com/Tobys_Supper_Club/Home.html3717 S Dutch Mill RoadMadison, WI 53718     (608) 222-6913",2691,0.17798636548636548,0.5362006512006511

I dont want to beat a dead horse, but I just gotta say, Tobys is awesome. Like, totally awesome.The bluegill at Tobys is only 11 beans and while its cheap, it doesnt mean they cheap out. A veritable boatload of bluegill fills the lunch hour basket adding up to at least 12 fillets.  Each is home to a light and flaky breading that make the delicate fish shine. There are no rubbery or tough textures to be found which results in pure munching pleasure. While the light coating could use a hint more seasoning it does seem to vary from piece to piece so maybe its just me. There are plenty of great potato options to choose from at Tobys but I cant seem to pull myself away from the hash brown with cheese and onion. These spuds are pleasantly greasy with a great flavor meld between the gooey cheese, potent onion, crispy and supple shreds. They are some of the best around and thats all that needs to be said. Tobys is a supper club by name and as such boast a big, bold, supper club style tartar. This stuff has it all, thickness, creaminess, pungentness? Thats probably not a word, but I probably dont care. It kicks the fish into high gear and that all that matters. Ka-pow! A thick piece of French bread sidles up to the fish like a sidler does as was just that and nothing more. The slaw is finely chopped and sweet and that just fine with me. And of course, no Fish Fry at Tobys would be complete without the bonus cup of Shoeps ice cream after. It puts a smile on everyones face, big kids and little kids alike. I know the horse has been beaten, and it probably dead and decomposing at this point, but every time I go to Tobys Im going to tell you whats what. It great, its superb, its everything a Fish Fry should be.

Pretty much the standard lunch Fast, friendly, in and out in 30 minutes. 10 fillets of varying sizes. Fish has a great flavor, but breading didnt have much seasoning. Still smooth and silky as the light breading lets the fish shine and the flakiness take center stage. Hard to complain about that. Fishy fish loves peppy tartar and this sauce takes it over the top. Perfection incarnate, tis thick, creamy, and bold with everything you want and nothing you dont. Hash browns with cheese and onion are normally above reproach. Today they were a little burned on their undercarriage. Still sufficed. A big old chunk of fresh French bread and a 2 oz. cup of homemade slaw round it out, and while the slaw has lost some of it sugar its still sweet as can be. And of course it wouldnt be Tobys without a single serving of Schoeps ice cream for desert. I said there was no time to explain and I stand by that (even if I did explain a little).

Sure, a little more salt might make them even more delectable but these things are pretty close to perfect as it is. The perch is the real deal (yellow perch), and the six hulking fillets were wrapped in the same light breading that lets the meat shine.

Say its small. Say its cramped on Friday nights. Say its not your cup of tea. Say any of those things, just dont say they dont have a good Fish Fry. Thats just not true. Tobys has a great Fish Fry and perhaps the best that Madison has to offer. Their slate of fish is as complete as any, fully stocked with: cod, lake perch, walleye (baby pike), bluegill, and even catfish. During the lunch hour the baby pike goes for $12 and the bluegill for $11. I dined on both recently and heres what I thoughtThey were great. End of storyJust kidding. Dont get me wrong, they are great, but thats far from the end of the story. The baby pike is actually a man-sized portion as the two fillets add up to at least 10 oz. of meat. The young fish have a smooth and flaky texture that is more tender than their adult counterparts and dont have the same musky flavor. Its a really sophisticated rendition and tastes more like lake perch than a full grown walleye. The supple meat pairs elegantly with Tobys wispy breading resulting in perfectly balanced fillets. The bluegill is also immaculate and as hearty as you see for $11. The nine or so fillets will vary in size but will be consistently delicious. The subtle fishy flavor is complemented by the same lightly-seasoned breading as the walleye resulting in nothing less than pure satisfaction. Steak fries, baked potato or hash browns come on the side and are all good choices. The fries tend to fluctuate around the mean taste-wise but never get more than one standard deviation away and always come in droves. The hash browns, on the other hand, are always superb especially when loaded up with onion and topped with a slab of classic American cheese. Tobys tartar is simply bangin, and while the fish doesnt call out for it, it always welcome. Its the supper club standard thick and creamy mayo mix with just enough relish to keep things interesting. It brings down the house every time. At lunch a nice, soft piece of French bread partners with a cup of Tobys sweeter-than-most coleslaw forming a dynamic duo thats more than up to snuff. Where so many places stumble in this area, Tobys excels, be it ever so subtly. As if the stupendous fish and fantastic sides werent enough, Tobys even throws in a personal-sized serving of ice cream when all is said and done at no extra charge. How do ya like them apples (or in this case strawberries and vanillas)? Tobys continues to impress and is easily one of, if not the absolute best Fish Frys Madison has to offer.

Not only is it one of the only true supper clubs in Madison, but its Fish Fry has historically been one of the best values around. All of the fish options hover around the $10 mark and come with the standard trimmings in addition to a few little extras. When we recently heard rumors that the Fish Fry institution was slipping we scoffed at the thought and vowed to disprove them as soon as possible. Unfortunately, we couldnt. We showed up for lunch with a huge group (at least huge for tiny Tobys). We were eight adults (and a few kids) deep which took up a good chunk of one of the dining rooms, but since it was lunch there was no one else in it anyway so it wasnt really a problem. Eventually we got enough tables and chairs cobbled together and the waitress made her way over to get us some drinks and relay the lunch specials. She eventually came back with the beverages and took our orders. There was a lot of freshwater fish on her notepad when all was said and done, with bluegill and hash browns comprising our line item. Like the drinks, the fish took a while to fry which was a bit surprising considering Tobys usually pumps it out like none other. When it came our way it was still hot, but not steaming like it has been literally every other time weve been there. The bluegill in the basket looked wimpy compared to what were used to as there were only 6 or so fillets. Weve become accustomed to 9 or more of the diminutive divers dotting the checkerboard and to see so few was a bit of a shock. Whats more, a couple of them looked and tasted more like perch than bluegill which definitely got out Spidey Senses tingling. As for the fish, it was good, but the breading lacked the signature seasoning we hold so dear. Since multiple people ordered hash browns with cheese and onion they came on shared plates, which isnt necessarily a bad thing except that they seemed rushed. The edges werent crispy, and the slices of American cheese on top werent close to melted which left the flavors eerily separated instead of happily married. Thankfully, the tartar was the good stuff and perked up the under-seasoned fish. The coleslaw was a mixed bag as one cup lacked the signature sweetness of Tobys homemade mix, while a different one delivered the goods. We suspect one scoop came from the top while the more flavorful one was from the bottom where is had a chance to soak in the goodsFinishing thing off was a piece of French bread that was more boring the benevolent. It would have ended the Fry with a real thud if not for the personal servings of Schoeps ice cream which everyone agreed helped Tobys save some face. Were not really sure whats going on, but everything seems to have taken a little step back. While Tobys is still better than most of the other Fish Frys out there what we had this time around wasnt as great as weve come to expect. Its really a shame as this marks our first less-than-amazing experience at Tobys, and takes a little bit of the polish off the apple. Overall, we still highly recommend this Fish Fry, but cant just default to it when asked: What is the best Fish Fry in Madison anymore.  www.tobyssupperclub.com/Tobys_Supper_Club/Home.html3717 S Dutch Mill RoadMadison, WI 53718     (608) 222-6913",3330,0.1347265625,0.45006076388888894

Tobys is great, this is just a little more proof.Tobys can be a beast to get into during dinner on Friday. Its guaranteed that they will be busy and that you will have to wait for a table. You just have to roll with it and enjoy having a cocktail or two while crammed in around the bar. If youre like us, youll just show up for lunch instead when the bar is open and the service much quicker. While lunch is more informal than dinner, the portions are identical. The $10 bluegill basket features eight lovely fillets with a great texture and a light breading. It is very well balanced and some of the best bluegill available on this, or any other, planet. Tobys signature steak-cut fries accompany the fish and are delightfully crunchy and hearty. They go blow-for-blow with the bluegill offsetting the succulent fish with their crispiness until the end. A thick and creamy tartar hits the mark in every way possible and serves as a flawless complement to the smooth fish. Likewise, the homemade coleslaw plays its part to perfection without overshadowing the stars of the show. Some soft and crusty French bread often finds its way into the basket and serves as a satisfactory starch. To top things off Tobys offers an individual serving of Schoeps ice cream with their Fish Fry which is an added bonus you just dont find many other places, especially at this price point. Tobys is simply the best, no ifs and or buts about it, and from the amount of people you see there on any given Friday you dont really need us to keep saying it.

When we started our quest to find the best Fish Fry in Madison we pledged to give every place their day in the sun and to that end we have succeeded. At this point weve exhausted almost all the possibilities and have started to return to some of our favorites many times over. This list is populated by places like Dexters Pub, The Villa Tap, Wilsons Bar & Grill, and of course, Tobys Supper Club. These are places we have been dozens of times and never been disappointed so why wouldnt we come back? They are simply the best.This trip to Tobys was much like every one before it  exceptional. I had an infant with me, but even so made it in and out in around 20 minutes. Im a slave to Tobys bluegill and even though its gone from $9.50 to $10.50 its still an outstanding bargain. This time around there were nine moist, juicy fillets in the basket each of which was enrobed in light, flaky breading with just enough seasoning. I wolfed them down enjoying each of the salty delights with a generous dollop of Tobys textbook tartar sauce. A side of steak fries comes standard with the lunch specials at Tobys and are crispy and delicious. The portion today was on the small side (at least as far as Tobys is concerned) but since the spuds are hearty they still filled me up. Its hard to get a handle on the bread situation at Tobys since its constantly changing, but this time it was just a standard dinner roll. Meh. On the other hand, the slaw is always the same and the finely-chopped, saccharine delight keeps me coming back for more. Since I was in a rush I didnt stick around for ice cream, but rest assured its included in the price of the lunch so make sure to ask for it if you want it. While some might call it a rut, I call my affinity for Tobys a well-reasoned decision. I have been to the other places. For the most part they are usually more expensive than Tobys and their food isnt nearly as tasty so it would be silly to go there and get less while spending more. I try to be fair, but Im not an idiot. Overall, we cant recommend Tobys highly enough and have no qualms about calling this the best Fish Fry in Madison. www.tobyssupperclub.com/Tobys_Supper_Club/Home.html3717 S Dutch Mill RoadMadison, WI 53718     (608) 222-6913",2383,0.1333994708994709,0.5000377928949358

What most people really mean is What is the best beer battered cod in Madison? since that is what 90% of people think of when they think of Fish Fry. Here at Madison Fish Fry we tend to think of the Wisconsin tradition a little differently. For us Fish Fry means much more than just drenching a piece of cod in a batter so thick that you cant even taste the fish. We think that the flavor of the fish deserves to shine, which is why we tend to like freshwater fish dusted in a light, well-seasoned breading. While we still love a good beer battered cod now and then, the subtle nuances are what really keep us coming back every Friday, and beer batter can get monotonous if that is all you eat. Tobys Supper Club is one place that understands that Fish Fry goes beyond beer batter. For our money Tobys is the best all-around Fish Fry in Madison. They run the gamut of freshwater options on Fridays and still have the cod that most people want (although theirs is a lightly breaded version not a beer battered beast). On this visit we sampled their $11 lake perch offering with a side of their famous hash browns with cheese and onions. As per usual the fish came alarmingly fast, and was steaming hot. Five perch fillets dotted the red & white checkered piece of wax paper that lined the basket, and tasted great, although they lacked the pop of Tobys bluegill. Instead they had a mellow flavor which was complemented by a breading that was light to the touch, but also light on the seasoning. The fish flavor was very subtle making the perch a good stepping stone for those who like cod, but are considering branching out a little or just want a change of pace. A small plate of hash browns came on the side and were exactly as they should be. The mini-loaf was fried to perfection and featured plenty of onion and a singular slice of American cheese. Their crispy edges were balanced by a supple center, making bites where both contingents were present a menagerie of textures and flavors. Crispy, gooey, cheesy, melty, yummy. Expertly fried fish is great on its own, but when its paired with a topnotch tartar magic happens. Tobys tartar is the Ace in the deck and makes everything it touches better than it was before. Tobys slaw is also some of the best you will find and clearly made in-house. Its a finely-chopped rendition that is zesty and delicious, and has a little sugar in it that really tickles the taste buds. The bread that comes with Tobys fish varies from visit to visit, but this go-round is was the usual slice off a French loaf. The plain starch plays it part admirably, but draws little fanfare for its effort. Very few places include dessert with their Fish Fry, but Tobys isnt your usual place. They always have ice cream, cinnamon rolls, or cookies (even during lunch), and the strawberry sundae ice cream today was the perfect ending to another marvelous meal. If youre looking for the typical beer battered cod there are plenty of places to get your fix in town. However, if youre like us and want something different from time to time try the perch, bluegill, walleye, or catfish at Tobys Supper Club. We promise youll be glad you did. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and will say it again: Tobys has the best all-around Fish Fry in Madison. Take that to the bank. www.tobyssupperclub.com/Tobys_Supper_Club/Home.html3717 S Dutch Mill RoadMadison, WI 53718     (608) 222-6913",3596,0.2391783762685402,0.48808157689305226

No matter how early you get there they are going to be incredibly busy and there will be a wait involved, there is just no getting around it. Luckily, its a lively scene, the bartenders sling drinks like theres no tomorrow, and everyone has a great time while theyre waiting for their fish. Its an experience every Madisonite should have at least once in their life, and here at Madison Fish Fry weve shared it with friends plenty of times. Of course, there are times when we want Tobys fish, but dont want the wait involved with Friday night. In these instances we just head over during the noon hour, when the same fish is served, but without the long wait and a few of the supper club perks (like the famous relish tray). During lunch Tobys fish comes basket-style, and I had my order of bluegill about five minutes after I ordered it. Just because its lunch time doesnt mean Tobys cuts any corners either. For $10 they pump out 11 bluegill fillets, a pile of fries, all the standard accompaniments, AND even a personal serving of Schoeps ice cream. This time it was Strawberry. As always the bluegill this visit was smashing. Each of the diminutive fillets was tender and juicy, with no grease or rubbery textures. They all featured Tobys signature light breading which enhances all the subtle nuances of the fish without overwhelming any of them. It is truly almost perfect. With so much fish you might expect that theyd skimp on the sides, but Tobys trots out a ton of taters. For lunch the only choice is between steak fries and a baked potato (no hash browns), but the portion is still bountiful. Each of them this round were big, long cuts with no skimpy little nubs. In addition they were all perfectly fried with crispy outsides and fluffy insides. Tobys knows how to fry. When fish is as good as Tobys bluegill is it really doesnt need any help, but Tobys provides some of the best tartar available anyway. Its as thick as they come, creamy as can be, and monstrously mayo-y. Its the icing on the bluegill cake, and pushes the flavor of the fish even further. Tobys homemade slaw is also superb, and you simply cant do much better than they finely-chopped, zesty blend. In addition, Tobys has recently upgraded their bread offering and the roll this round was a muffin-looking bun, that was incredibly airy, soft, and warm. It was a clear step up from the basic dinner roll, and worthy of some extra credit. Tobys just continues to do their thing and represent the Friday Fish Fry about as well as anyone in the state. Overall, we highly, highly, highly recommend this Fish Fry and love each and every thing about it.  www.tobyssupperclub.com/Tobys_Supper_Club/Home.html3717 S Dutch Mill RoadMadison, WI 53718     (608) 222-6913",2841,0.20064558629776022,0.4886154244306419

If and when its available I get it. In fact, the last five times Ive been to the fabled club thats been my fish of choice. Its almost a sin to pass it up, but this time around I forced myself to do it. It was incredibly difficult, but I somehow managed to get the words lake perch out before my brain could tell my mouth otherwise.2007 was the last time I actually had lake perch at Tobys, and of course, the bluegill is mostly to blame. Tobys perch is no slouch either, but next the sunfish it just doesnt quite stack up even though its better than almost every other fish out there. I put my order in after having a couple beers, and the bartender brought my basket out about 5 minutes later (Tobys kitchen runs like clockwork on Fridays). While I truly love the bluegill, the lake perch this Friday was nothing less than amazing. The six fat fillets were moist and juicy, and slid down like butter. Each was perfectly fried, and coated with Tobys light breading which features just the right amount of spice to let the flavor of the fish shine through. It was a succulent dish, and while I still like the bluegill a little better the perch definitely gave it a run for its money. Every other part of this Fish Fry upheld Tobys superlative standard as well. From the thick-cut steak fries, to the creamy tartar and the homemade coleslaw, each element was superb. A small slice of French bread finished off the basket adequately, and when all was said and done a personal cup of Schoeps ice cream sealed the deal. While the fries were frugally portioned, they were expertly fried and totally delicious. Tobys tartar is also amazing, and arguably the best you will find anywhere. It pairs perfectly with the perch, and really pushes it over the top. The homemade sauce also has a great zip, much like the finely-chopped slaw which is sweet and savory, and good until the last bite. The small piece of French bread was tucked in under the tartar and was less impressive than the rest of the items, but at least it was there. While the bluegill still rules the roost at Tobys, the lake perch is a definite contender for the throne. The perch was incredibly delicious, and will certainly make me think twice before defaulting to the bluegill from here on out. Overall, I highly recommend the lake perch at Tobys, and if for some reason the bluegill isnt available I wont hesitate to order it again. www.tobyssupperclub.com/Tobys_Supper_Club/Home.html3717 S Dutch Mill RoadMadison, WI 53718     (608) 222-6913",2577,0.2611165577342047,0.45397447868036095

The diminutive supper club on Madisons far eastside has been serving up some of the finest Fish Fry in the area for years and the masses have fully caught on to that fact. The fabulous food has led to some staggeringly long waits on Friday nights which has necessitated us taking a different route to get our fill of their delicious fishes. Instead of fishing on Friday nights weve turned Tobys into one of our noon hour destination since you can get the same fish, but without the lengthy wait. Its a win-win if ever there was one.This time around I showed up right at noon with Norbert and Travis in tow. Since it was lunch there were plenty of tables to choose from even though there were several likeminded groups getting their fish fix this Friday. The specials were listed on the neon board and I was pleased to see they included bluegill in addition to Tobys standard cod and lake perch. I bounced back and forth between the freshwater fish momentarily, but of course settled on bluegill once our waitress came around. Big Norb, Travis, and I only had a few moments to discuss the weekly high school football goings-on before the food showed up - Tobys simply doesnt mess around when it comes to frying fish. My basket looked just beautiful from the onset. It was home to 10ish bluegill fillets, and handful of Tobys special steak fries, a small Solo of tartar and larger one of slaw, a slice of French bread, and a lemon wedge (the citrus would go unused). It was pretty as a picture, but destined to be destroyed. The bluegill fillets varied in sized, but were consistently delicious. Each of the small swimmers was perfectly breaded and fried. Tobys breading is light and flaky with just enough seasoning to give the delicate fish an ideal balance of flavors. Of course, Tobys bluegill comes with the skin intact, so if youre scared of the skin this probably isnt the fish for you, although if youre scared of skin, Fish Fry might not be your thing in general. In my opinion, the skin provides a flavor that the meat would never be able to achieve on its own making the bluegill truly unique and incredibly desirable. The steak fries at Tobys are more conventional than the bluegill, but no less delicious. Like the fish, they are consistently well-fried and boast crispy exteriors and plush interiors. These are the fries youve come to know and love, and if you havent yet, you can bet you will should you ever get your mitts on some of them. Light and flaky fish blends best with a mostly-mayo tartar, and that is exactly what Tobys delivers. Their homemade sauce contains the requisite amount of relish, but the mayo contingent comes to the front to provide the perfect complement to the fantastic fish. When it comes to sides Tobys dont steal the show, but at this point they dont really need to. The slice of French bread that came with today was fresh, and soft, while the slaw was great, but still played second fiddle to the fish. Regardless, the killer coleslaw was cool and creamy with enough horseradish to keep things interesting. Of course, once youve satisfied your salty side Tobys trots out a personal-sized cup of Schoeps ice cream for your sweet tooth. Today there were three flavors to choose from of which I went for the plain old vanilla. A little ice cream is simply a superb way to cap a Fish Fry, and since its included in the cost of the meal its a total bonus. Bluegill, fries, tartar, slaw, bread AND dessert all for only 10 skins? Sign me up! What can you say about Tobys? They just never miss. The food is always superb, the staff is always incredibly friendly (even during the Friday night rush), and its simply a smoking great deal. Overall, we highly, highly, highly recommend the bluegill Tobys, and think its the #1 Fish Fry in Madison proper.

Traditionally, supper clubs are only open for supper, but I guess when your supper club is as popular as Tobys you tend to take your name with a grain of salt. While Tobys has no problem sticking to the supper club mantra of quality food at a comfortable price, they do have a problem meeting demand for their fabulous night Friday Fish Fry and thus had to make a change. The place is simply too small, and the fish is too tasty, which basically necessitated Tobys opening their doors to the lunch crowd. Tobys Lunch Club? Works for me.As youd expect, lunch at Tobys is slightly scaled back and the standard relish tray that comes with dinner is nowhere to be found. What youll find in its place will be bluegill, which is not offered during dinner on Fridays and is one of Tobys treasures. The diminutive divers go for nine bucks and since they were available I didnt even consider ordering anything else. The dude tending bar had tats galore and looked like he could punch through a wall, but handled our fish with grace. In classic lunch club fashion, the goods were ready in no time, came in a red-and-white wax-paper lined basket, and looked absolutely perfect. There were at least 10-12 bluegill fillets (which is a lot), with each being a tiny piece of fried perfection. They had the satisfying snap, and the light fishy flavor you expect from bluegill. The freshwater finsters were complimented by Tobys thin breading, which is light on the gums, but heavy on the taste buds. Offsetting the delicate fish was a plethora of Tobys thick-cut, battered steak fries. They were done just right, as the crispy coating gave way to perfectly plump interiors. As far as fries go these are way up there. Tobys tartar is also among the best, and while the fries lend a contrast to the juicy fish with their crunch, the sauce shares the load, making the fish ever more succulent. The blend is as thick as it gets, and has just enough relish to make you take notice. It is expertly done, and although the fish hardly needs it, it adds something to the sensation. A plain piece off French bread buddied up with the main trio, but was nothing special. Likewise, the coleslaw was just kind of there, and while the finely-chopped concoction is usually creamy and delicious, this time it was a little dry and boring. Oh well, coleslaw doesnt break many hearts anyway. In classic Tobys fashion even the lunch Fish Fry comes with a dessert, and this today it was a single serving of Schoepps vanilla ice cream. It really is the cherry on top, and one of the subtle perks that sets Tobys apart. When it comes to Fish Fry the little things often that make the all difference, and Tobys is one of the places that really seems to realize that.By rule supper clubs are going to be busy on Friday and Saturday nights and Tobys is far from the exception. Luckily for those of us who arent always in the mood to fight the rush, Tobys Lunch Club is there to meet our needs. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and still think it is the finest that Madison has to offer regardless of the time of day. www.tobyssupperclub.com/Tobys_Supper_Club/Home.html3717 S Dutch Mill RoadMadison, WI 53718     (608) 222-6913",3231,0.13365079365079366,0.5427601410934746

When it comes to Tobys Supper Club you might assume weve seen all there is to see, but even then youd be wrong. Yes, weve been there around a dozen times, and yes, weve sampled all the fish varieties they have to offer, but the ever crafty Toby keeps a few tricks up his sleeve. Weve definitely done it, but apparently not all of it.If youve been to Tobys for dinner on Friday nights you know that it can be a challenge, especially if you dont like noise and/or have kids. Luckily, for those of us not wanting to fight the crowds, Tobys now offers lunch, including fish specials on Fridays. On our first lunch hour excursion to the Old Dutch Mill mainstay the only fish on special was cod, and we felt fortunate to even get that. Since then, Tobys has branched out, and the noon hour offerings this Friday included lake perch and (the usually not available on Friday) bluegill. Tricky Toby. Since bluegill was on the menu my order was basically an afterthought. The kitchen had the baskets ready within mere minutes, and they were quickly brought to the table by the unexpectedly polite bartender with all the tats. My catch consisted of 8-10 bluegill fillets, a pile of steak fries, a cup of tartar, a cup of coleslaw, and a slice off a loaf of French bread. I wasted no time.My first stop was the fish, and the bluegill on this journey was to die for. It was delicate and flavorful with just the right amount of snap. While the breading wasnt tissue-thin, it wasnt thick either, and more importantly the seasoning in it didnt mask the fish. The bluegill was simply superb with and all-around sweetness that bordered on perfection. Typically youd find us feasting on hash browns with cheese and onion when having dinner at Tobys, but during lunch the only options available are a baked potato or the thick-cut steak fries. Again, my choice was basically an afterthought. Like the fish the fries were plentiful and delicious with a crispy batter coating that goes toe-to-toe with any weve crunched.  Pairing with Tobys near-perfect fish was Tobys near-perfect tartar sauce. It is a seriously thick mix that doesnt skimp on the relish, but still has a great balance. While the bluegill barely needed it, the bites the blend did bless were truly transcendent. Ive always thought the slaw at Tobys to be some of the best around, but this rendition was a little sweet for my tastes. While I dont mind a good zest to the slaw, this finely-chopped batch was a little runny, and seemed to be spiked with sugar. It definitely had a pop, but it wasnt the back-of-the-taste buds pop I like. The slice of French bread was also a little off-kilter, but was a slight improvement over a basic dinner roll, so I cant complain. And of course, the real show stopper at Tobys is the dessert that is included with every meal (even lunch). This time around it was a nice single serving of Schoep's ice cream which is just a great way to finish off lunch.Once again Tobys answered the call to action. Even at lunch they brought an impressive arsenal, regardless of whether a relish tray was part of it. The fish, fries, and tartar were all amazing, and the slaw and bread did what the needed to do. Tack on a shot of ice cream and there really isnt much more that needs to be said. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and assume well be taking advantage of lunch at Tobys more often from here on out. It is just too good not to. www.tobyssupperclub.com/Tobys_Supper_Club/Home.html3717 S Dutch Mill RoadMadison, WI 53718     (608) 222-6913",3648,0.19615968801313627,0.5190188834154352

Regardless of your choice, theyll be expertly fried and compliment the fish exactly how they are supposed to. The last element in any good Fish Fry is the coleslaw.

On Fridays they feature cod, lake, perch, walleye, and catfish, but the bluegill is reserved for the off-nights  it is a little strange, but that is just the way it is. Inside Tip: Make yourself knownIf you go on a Friday Tobys will be busy and it will seem like there is no rhyme or reason to what is transpiring. What you need to do is get as close to the bar as possible, get a menu from the bartender if you need one (the Fish Fry specials are listed on the wall so you shouldnt), and figure out what you want. The waitresses will be hovering around the area and if youre lucky you can catch her eye. If not, let the bartender know you want to eat and theyll point the wait staff in your direction. At this point, just give them your order, continue enjoying some beverages, and theyll come back and get you just before your food is ready.

Sure, we have a solid core of favorites in the area, but more often than not, we like to branch out in an effort to find newer and better Fish Frys. With so many reputable restaurants around this isnt always an easy task and can be made even more difficult by friends who have allegiances of their own. Case and point: Tobys.We had just dined on the delectability that is Tobys cod a couple weeks back, but when Grahms big day rolled around we were powerless to deny him his birthday wish. His wish of course was fish, with the classic supper club being the spot that drew his fancy. The core of our crew convened at 5:30, secured a bar-side locale, and got loosened up with a few beers and some key lime pie martinis (the bartenders specialty, we were told). By 6:00 our full party of 11 was in attendance and our orders finally sailed kitchenward. We passed the next hour and a half BSing with the Yahn collective and enjoying the plethora of drinks which passed between Tobys speedy bartenders and our hoard. Eventually the wheels were fully greased and we hit dining room full-bore. Awaiting us were two massive relish trays, two bountiful baskets of bread, and our appetizers, which were spread around the table in such a way that it required one to choose their spot with the utmost care. I chose wisely, landing directly on my plate of Tobys homemade coleslaw. The fresh and zesty slaw was a welcome sight and put some much needed sustenance in my stomach. The soft, fresh roll was also very good and along with the slaw set the stage perfectly for the big boppers which were to come. Maybe Tobys went out of their way this Friday, or maybe it was just coincidence, but whatever it was they had a surprise in store for Grahm. The special birthday treat turned out to be Tobys blessed bluegill which is normally not on the Friday menu. With lake perch unavailable the foster fish took over our table as literally every fish eater ordered it. Nine peoples plates overflowed with 10 to 11 of the lightly breaded, luscious fillets. The sassy sunfish was light and flaky, combining with the breading to produce an idyllic sensation. The flavors were well balanced and exactly what bluegill is meant to taste like. Enhancing the already outstanding fish was Tobys rich, homemade tartar sauce. The mayo laden mix was extra thick, and its velvety texture complimented delicate bluegill superbly. After our last trip there was no way we were going to pass on the hash browns with cheese and onion, and even though they cost a buck extra they were well worth it yet again. Since multiple people ordered them, the two massive potato-domes came family-style, each impregnated with ample onion and slathered with three slices of American cheese. The perfectly cooked taters were simply divine and helped take the meal over the top.At some point during our dinner the waitress got word that we were celebrating a birthday. Perhaps it was the rendition of Happy Birthday that spontaneously erupted mid-meal (or maybe it was Grahms mom whispering it in her ear)? Regardless of what it was, just as we were finishing our fish a small birthday cake appeared for old Grahmer. A second round of the traditional tune was sung and we all got to try a small piece of the fresh-from-the-freezer cake. It was a nice surprise, and was totally compd by our hosts - that is the kind of excellent service you can expect from a family-run place like Tobys. Tobys is a classic supper club that has evolved to become one of Madisons most reputable Fish Fry institutions. Overall, we highly recommend the bluegill as well as each and every fish they serve. From cod to catfish, perch to pike, they do them all well, and support them with fantastic sides - a true hallmark of the best Fish Frys. Sure, Tobys can be a tough sell for the faint of heart since you are pretty much guaranteed to have a long wait, but you are also guaranteed to have one hell of a good time, and when all is said and done, that is really what Fish Fry is all about. Im pretty sure the birthday boy would agree that a Fish Fry at Tobys with friends and family is the best present you could ever hope to get. Same time next year, bud? Were already looking forward to it.www.tobyssupperclub.com/Tobys_Supper_Club/Home.html3717 S Dutch Mill RoadMadison, WI 53718     (608) 222-6913",4395,0.24114248800295307,0.5456229235880397

This phenomenon is even more powerful when the two meet in such a way or at such a place that they both come to reach their full potential. When Madison Fish Fry and Madison A to Z met at Tobys for a Fish Fry just such an event occurred; the supernova of supper clubbyness which ensued would leave a permanent mark on Madisons dining landscape. We agreed to meet the well-respected duo that is Madison A to Z at the classic club around 4:30, hoping that we might beat the rush. Yeah right When we (Jer and I) arrived on-the-dot we werent the least bit surprised to see Tobys was already bustling, and the entire bar area was full of folks waiting to eat. We struck up on conversation with an ultra-friendly 86 year old Tobys regular who we dubbed ""Butch"" and heard many stories of his glory days at UW and cattle prospecting near our hometown (truth be told, Butch did most of the striking up, he was friendly like that). It was totally cool, and when JM and Nichole arrived a little while later we were deeply engrossed in conversation with our new acquaintance and his lovely wife. They were just great folks, the kind you expect to find at Tobys. As always, once we were all present the waitress found us and took our orders: Jer and I craved cod with hash browns (cheese & onion of course), JM picked the perch and fries, while Nichole plucked the pike and shared in our side of hash browns (when multiple people order the hash browns they come family-style, apparently). We didnt have to wait long (at least for Tobys) and took our seats in the southwest wing around 5 oclock.Of course, as soon as we sat down our quartet was greeted by the supper club staples that those of us born and bred in Wisconsin have come to expect and appreciate at our Fish Frys: a relish tray, a basket of rolls (including cellophane wrapped breadsticks), and our respective coleslaw/salad/cottage cheese choices. My coleslaw was clearly homemade, had a subtle taste of real cabbage flavor, and was simply delightful. It paired elegantly with the crinkle-cut carrots I snagged of the relish tray, and while I didnt partake in any of the celery, radishes, or green onion on the dish I was happy to know they were there for others enjoyment.The requisite rolls were soft and delicious and when combined with the garlic infused breadsticks constituted a well above average bread option. I polished off my last bites of bun just as the fish came, and was delighted when I saw my tidy plate of cod with an enormous pile of potatoes in tow.For $11 (a $1 jump in price from our last visit) Tobys treats you the three meaty pieces of cod which are expertly prepared. The stark-white cod was tender and moist, and paired with a light and tasty breading which wasnt overdone. I picked several sections of the translucent breading off the fish and enjoyed them solo to see just how good they were. It turns out the brilliant breading was outstanding on its own, so you can only image what it did to enhance the already pristine fish. On its own, the fish was excellent, but when Tobys triumphant tartar joined in the mix, there was a new sensation that INXS themselves would be proud of. The homemade sauce was creamy and housed the ideal relish blend to go with its thick mayo contingent. The cup was small, but I made it last all the way to end as only small dabs were necessary with the cod.The crowning jewel in this Fish Fry were the hash browns for which side plates were supplied. The porky pile of potatoes was infused with ample onion and capped with three slices of melted American. We were all allotted a generous portion of the shredded spuds and still wound up with some to spare. The browns were delicious, and boasted a crispy, golden shell and supple center. All in all, they were very good, and even better than Tobys thick-cut steak fries which we have been a big fans of in the past. Overall, we highly recommend Tobys especially if you enjoy the true supper club experience. Yes, the place is tiny, and you should be prepared to wait, but that is what going out on Friday is all about in our opinion. Luckily, we had good company to pass the time with, and the reward for our patience was great fish for a great price. What more can you ask for? Good folks, good fish, good drinks, and good times  thats Tobys in a nutshell. www.tobyssupperclub.com/Tobys_Supper_Club/Home.html3717 S Dutch Mill RoadMadison, WI 53718     (608) 222-6913",4518,0.2760742386268701,0.560410005199479

On the way there I noticed Toby’s had a sign out that said they were open for lunch. I would never have guessed that they would be open for lunch and was tempted to just pull off and forego my trip to The Park Side. Since I have been to Toby’s a number of times I tried to stick to my guns and sped past to put their delicious fish out of my mind as quickly as possible. A few minutes later I was at the Park Side. I soon realized that there wasn’t a single car in the lot and the place was in the process of being remodeled. This didn’t seem like a good day to put them to the test and since Toby’s was still fresh in my mind I whipped a sh*tty (as my brother would say) and headed back to Toby’s.I pulled into the lot at Toby’s around 12:15 and was glad to see it was not as packed as it is on a Friday night. There were still a lot of people mind you, but nowhere near as many as you expect during dinner time. I didn’t have any company today so I sat down at the bar alone and ordered my Spotted Cow from the friendly, heavily “inked” bartender.  For lunch Toby’s only offers cod and lake perch which is nowhere near the array of fish that they do for dinner. That was okay with me though because I was in the mood for some melt in your mouth cod. I ordered right from the bartender, sat back, drank my drink and enjoyed a little SportsCenter. About 15 minutes later my fish was ready.The lunch fish fry comes in a basket which is a definite departure from how the dinner is served. The 2 pieces of cod were light and flaky as I hoped but where not scalding hot which gave a tiny bit of grease the chance to accumulate. It was still very good but I think it must have had to wait a couple minutes for the French fries which were unbearably hot. The fries were delicious but I wish it would have been the other way around: scalding hot fish and lukewarm fries = still delicious, lukewarm fish and scalding fries = less delicious. Sacrifice the fries, not the fish! Regardless, it was still better than 90% of the fish out there just not pure perfection as I have come to expect from Toby’s.The tartar was, and always is, awesome, and helped to kick the fish up a notch. The roll served with lunch was surprisingly uninspired, but the coleslaw was good, so whatever. For lunch I don’t expect everything to blow me away, especially for 8 bucks or so. Plus, when all is said and dome Toby’s always gives you some sort of desert which kicks ass. This time it was chocolate ice cream (although it was from somewhere down south instead of Wisconsin ::eyeroll:: ). I am glad to know that Toby’s does lunch. It actually makes it somewhat easy to get a great Fish Fry without the ridiculous crowd you would have to deal with at dinner time. Toby’s is one of the best around and although this particular visit wasn’t the best ever, a “B” visit to Toby’s is most others “A.”www.tobyssupperclub.com/Tobys_Supper_Club/Home.html3717 S Dutch Mill RoadMadison, WI 53718     (608) 222-6913",3123,0.2529579663631388,0.5446090212469523

Since I was flying out on a Thursday it made perfect sense to hit up a Wednesday night Fish Fry at Toby’s. We got to Toby’s fairly early, around 7pm, and the place was hoppin’ as it usually is. The Wednesday Fish Fry specials are not diverse as the Friday menu but the cod is still there. You can also get all the ‘normal’ options such as Baby Walleye and Lake Perch, but they are not on ‘special’. One interesting thing about Toby’s is that they do not offer Bluegill on Friday nights, but every other night of the week it is available. Since this was my first visit on a day other than Friday I knew I had to give it a try. What’s more, since my girlfriend was getting the cod, I knew I would be able to get a piece of that too. It was a total win-win situation for me.We sat at the bar for a good 15 minutes before we were able to get our order into a waitress, which allowed me plenty of time to get through the first and into my second Spotted Cow. Delicious. About 30 minutes after that our food was ready and she led us to our table. The table was ready with the Supper Club staples: a dish of carrots, celery, radishes and green onion; a basket with two loaves of bread and a basket with crackers and breadsticks; a bowl of pickles AND two cinnamon rolls!

There were at least 10 to 12 lightly battered pieces that just melted in your mouth. It almost makes me wonder why they don’t serve it on Fridays. I presume it is because they would not be able to meet the demand because this stuff was awesome. The cod was also spectacular, light and flaky with a marvelous taste that is tough to beat. Both of these fish, as well as all the other varieties at Toby’s, are easily recommendable. The taste and the crispiness of the steak-cut French fries were spot on, simply wonderful. The tartar sauce was great too.

I also got the hash browns with cheese and onions but should have went with the fries, which are the steak cut think style with the perfect amount of seasoning. The walleye is also very good, light and flaky with a delicious batter of its own.  The hash browns were good, not great. The tartar is always good and I was never in danger of running out.

Even their Friday Fish Fry garners high praise, despite the fact that the lauded rendition is anything but your traditional supper club faire. We finally got around to trying the atypical entrée a few weeks ago, and much like our experience with The Green Owl we enjoyed a tasty meal, but a classic Fish Fry it is not.Yes, there is fried fish in the what The Tornado calls their Wisconsin Fish Fry, but there is fried fish everywhere, and Im sorry, but a just because a McFish is fried doesnt make it a Fish Fry. The Tornados take features three pieces of fried lake perch, and some delicious potatoes, but that is about the extent of their typical-ness. From there the meal takes a turn, and while it does wind up being a fair deal for $14, it cant hold a candle to the AYCE fish you will get at somewhere like The Dorf Haus.Being that this is actually a pretty popular Fish Fry I was sure to ask the hostess if they had any perch left as soon as we stepped to her station (I didnt want to wind up in the same boat as  Cool Dadio, you see). She scurried away only to return moments later to share the good news that several portions did remain. At this point we took the bait and she charted a course to a small table outside the bustling establishment. We sat down, got our bearings, and within seconds made initial contact with our waitress. She was a true pro and in expert fashion immediately went over the specials and buzzed away to grab us a beer and a glass of vino from the bar. When she returned we put in our orders: fish for me, and for the wife, Asparagus Saint Jaques with a side salad.Before the fish we were treated to the Tornados signature bread plate, a relish tray and the clam chowder I opted for instead of salad. The bread plate was nothing short of outstanding. It consisted of three different styles of bread: one KFC-esque biscuit, one long breadstick, and one big loaf of special somethingerother. Each bread paired well with the homemade soup which was a zesty, unique take on the seafood classic. An ice filled glass with also distinctive, and came filled with radishes, carrots and other veggies instead of the water or soda one might expect.I knew what was coming so when the fish arrived I wasnt surprised at the atypical presentation. The three fair-sized pieces of perch came laid elegantly across the plate and were covered with a sweet sauce. This sauce took the place of the traditional tartar and paired well with the flaky pan-fried fish, although it was so saccharine that it basically dominated every bite. Although I was sure to note the high quality of the fish on the one or two sauce-less bites I did get. Since the Tornado is a classic steakhouse I had a feeling their hash browns would be topnotch, and they were. The huge loaf of shredded spuds was cooked perfectly, boasting crispy exteriors and supple interiors. The subtle amount of onion throughout was just right, and blended perfectly with the slice of melted Swiss laid gracefully atop. Overall, we just cant quite recommend this Fish Fry. This is a tough one because almost everything was very good, and clearly high quality, but in the end it just doesnt quite fit the bill of the Classic Wisconsin Fish Fry. As you might expect, the Tornado is a fancy steakhouse and these kinds of places feel the need to go above and beyond, often times going for that which will make them stand out. Unfortunately, that methodology just doesnt fit with our grading rubric, which ranks the traditional Fish Fry components. And even with that being so, it is still a close call.

Not only was their fish tasty, but it was relatively cheap too. It was the best of both worlds and a Fish Fry we happily relied on for years. Moreover it was a diverse Fish Fry with cod, walleye, and lake perch every Friday and not one of them over $12.00. Oh how things have changed.A few months ago we went to Wandos and tried the perch (which was historically the best of the bunch) and were massively disappointed when we were served ocean perch instead of the classic freshwater variety. It was the first sign of a Fish Fry in decline, but we hoped it was just a temporary setback. Unfortunately, on this visit the degeneration continued. Not only was the lake perch absent from the menu again, but any form of perch was gone altogether. The only remaining options were cod and walleye and since Id already had walleye earlier in the day I settled on the cod even though I was hesitant to do so. In addition, Wandos was busy this Friday (there was a Badger hockey game at the Kohl Center), but it wasnt thatThe fish actually arrived pretty quickly after that and looked decent (I was worried it would sit by the kitchen since the waitress couldnt have cared less). The plate featured all five items youd expect it to, and I started with the fish as you might expect me to. The cod actually tasted fine, but that was thanks exclusively to the seasoned breading. The fish itself was far from pristine and had a translucent appearance (a sure sign that it had been frozen for quite some time). Furthermore, it wasnt as flaky as youd like it to be and the ends had a brownish twinge to them.Item 2/5 was the curly fries I chose over the plain variety, and they were a hodgepodge to say the least. They tasted fine overall, but there were a lot of nubs and some that were a too crispy. It was definitely a mixed bag, but a bag you didnt necessarily mind holding. Next on the list was Wandos tartar which is their usual dilly blend that isnt terrible, but isnt exactly what youre after (especially when the cod could use a pick-me-up). Sitting in the fourth spot was a 4 oz cup of standard coleslaw. It wasnt a bad blend and was totally edible, but nothing youd come back for specifically. I ate it all anyway if that tells you anything. Rounding out the quintet was a regular dinner roll which was every bit of ordinary.While Wandos didnt deliver the goods this time around I dont think its totally a lost cause per se. They still have their walleye which reportedly remained very good, and is reasonably priced. Overall, we dont recommend the cod at Wandos, but would still come back for another crack at the walleye (provided it doesnt disappear from the menu too).  www.wandosbar.com/602 University AvenueMadison, WI 53715     (608) 256-5204",2810,0.06527544351073765,0.45201872201872206

What is good for one person isnt necessarily good for everyone, and while one person may like their walleye, someone else might not care for the exact same fish. Its a tough thing to accept, but such is life, and such is Fish Fry.Obviously, Wandos Bar & Grill is a college bar, and as with most college bars, it carries the & Grill stigma (a lot bar, not much grill). While I agree that the downtown destination is slightly more bar than grill, there are far worse offenders out there, and Wandos actually has pretty good food (especially their Fish Fry). While said Fry might bot be the Best in Madison as they claim, it is pretty darn good nonetheless. I suggested it to Nick, Rick, and Adam from work and they were interested, so off we went. The waitresses at Wandos are always speedy and we had our orders in to the kitchen within minutes of walking through the door. For some strange reason we all went with the walleye (except for Rick the non-fish eater who got a cheeseburger or some such thing). The plates were ready in well under ten minutes and made their way to our second floor table in style. I wasted no time and plunged right in to the fried bevy. My walleye fillet was long and thin - basically exactly what I have come to expect at Wandos. The fish itself was flaky and tender and I really enjoyed it. The moist meat was home to Wandos well-seasoned breading and I basically tore it to shreds. Unfortunately, Nicks piece had a few bones (which he was not a fan of), and a bit too much skin (which he also was not a fan of). Me? Ida just sawed right through the little buggers, but Nick was having none of it and picked through it until the end - to each his own I guess. Bones and skin are the risks of freshwater fish, and while I live with it and love it I accept that others can be skittish around them.Thick crinkle-cut fries are the norm at Wandos and this rendition was respectable. The chunky taters were loaded with season salt, and could have been a tad warmer, but that said, there was an absolute shitton of them which was nice for a fry fan like me. The tartar was also ample, and while they have toned down the dill somewhat recently, it is still visible in the mix. In its current state the dastardly dill is muted by the thick mayo and relish contingent making it much more desirable. The roll on the side was nothing special and mildly-stale, but at least it was there. The slaw was homemade, and borderline creamy, but only so-so. While Id call this visit to Wandos another resounding success the same cant be said for everyone in our party. I guess its true what they say: you really cant win em all (Wandos still clocks in at around 95% so I'll take it). Overall, I still highly recommend this Fish Fry (even if Nick wouldn't have), and will be back for another round sooner or later Im sure. www.wandosbar.com/602 University AvenueMadison, WI 53715     (608) 256-5204",2986,0.15311275194339713,0.48740271377368144

Luckily for me, when Friday the 22nd rolled around, he had an itch to use it and offered to treat. Even though the little lady and I were in the middle of buying a new (used) car, I wasnt about to let that put the kibosh on my Fish Fry plans. We met him and Jer on the second floor and wasted no time ordering three plates of perch when the waitress came by. The $8.75 perch was ready alarmingly fast and hot as can be when served. The pieces of fish were oddly sized and tasted much more fishy than normal, leading us to believe that Wandos subtly tried to switch to ocean perch. Gasp! Not a good choice. Even so, the perch was fine, but fish flavor dominated Wandos spicy breading (which isnt easy to do). Instead of the four large lake perch we are accustomed to seeing we got several smaller chunks of the presumed OP, which is a HUGE downgrade in our book.Thankfully, lots of Wandos special thick-cut crinkle fries picked up some of slack. They were well fried and balanced out the fishy fish well, but couldnt overcome it fully. The tartar also couldnt take things over the top as Wandos special dill-mix just doesnt do it for us.Next came the regular roll, which, unfortunately, was a little stale this time around. Like the change in fish, a change in slaw was also the order of the day. Mercifully, it was highly improved, as the new creamy blend had a great flavor with some serious zest.This certainly was not the typical Wandos experience. Strange fish, stale rolls and new slaw really turned this Fish Fry on its ear. Whats more, things no longer come in shifts like they used to, everything just comes on one big plate at the same time. I have to say, we like the old way and the old fish much better.Who knows? Maybe this visit was just an oddball? Maybe they got duped by the supplier into picking the inferior perch? Whatever the case may be, well give them the benefit of the doubt and hope they right the ship next time. Overall, we still can barely recommend this Fish Fry, but if things keep (d)evolving like this they are going to fall out of favor with us faster than you can say Hey, what the hell happened to my lake perch?www.wandosbar.com/602 University AvenueMadison, WI 53715     (608) 256-5204",2286,0.08026941143962421,0.4227120043077489

I mean, cmon, thats a total score, especially when you read the fine print and it says nothing of not being valid of Fridays. Half-price Fish Fry is twice as nice.No sooner had Reese, Matt, and I grabbed a table on the second tier, than one of Wandos friendly waitresses made her way over. She took our fish and drink orders in one fell swoop, and was gone in a flash to drop them by the downstairs frying crew.Normally there is a cue, and the side of slaw and standard white roll come a good 5 minutes before the fish. The line was apparently short today and the whole shebang came all at once, about three minutes after the order went it. Wandos has finally caught on to the fact that their fish was some of the best around for the price. They recently bumped everything up a notch, but even at $8.75 for cod or perch and $9.75 for walleye, it is still a square deal. My single walleye fillet was about averaged sized, which if you know walleye, is still a fair amount of meat. The fall-apart flaky fish was slathered with Wandos signature breading, which is simply some of the best out there. The fillet was so moist and flaky that it required even I to eat some of it with a fork for fear of it disintegrating in my grasp. A hearty portion of Wandos seasoned fries followed suit, and filled the belly without breaking the bank. Wandos uses the thick-cut crinkle style fries right out of the freezer, but lays a little stank on em, making them about as good as these kind of fry can be.Of course, Wandos signature massive cup of tartar came along. Unfortunately, this signature is practically illegible. While the homebrewed sauce did seem to be slightly improved, it still boasts a bit much dill, although it seems to have been cut with a hint more relish.The standard roll was there - thank you very much  as was Wandos homemade slaw. The slaw also seemed like it was slightly revamped as it had a little more zest, and a lot more color than I remember it having. Overall, we highly recommend every fish Wandos has to offer, but especially the walleye. It was simply another great meal, but thanks to Groupon, an even better deal. I guess, a Groupon for Wandos is as good as gold, cause, lets face it, we were going there anyway. www.wandosbar.com/602 University AvenueMadison, WI 53715     (608) 256-5204",2389,0.21756090808416384,0.47639811738648946

You simply cant go wrong with the walleye at Wandos. Not only is it some of the cheapest walleye you are going to find anywhere, but also some of the tastiest. It is a total win-win situation and really doesnt need to be analyzed a whole lot more than we already have, but here is our (brief) synopsis of last weeks visit.Reese, Doug and I arrived at the stronghold on the Francis/University corner right around noon and took one of several available tables on the second floor. The waitress came over shortly after she saw us and grabbed our orders: walleye with fries all around. She rushed the order to the kitchen and returned lickety-split with our rolls and coleslaw. The slaw and rolls carried out their usual routines - the slaw lacking zest and the roll lacking flavor. They were both slightly below average, but at least set the stage and forced our focus to the fish.The walleye came within 10 minutes of our orders going in, and was nice and hot. The adequate sized fillet was moist, tender, and complimented with a well-seasoned breading. The flaky fish fell apart effortlessly and was great with or without Wandos dilly tartar. While the walleye plate recently received a fifty cent bump in price, it is still a great deal as it really is a superb specimen. The dill dominated tartar came in a massive cup and I barely got half way through it. While I dont particularly care for this kind of tartar, Reese actually really liked it, and said he prefers it to the thick mayo based sauces that I covet. To each his own, I guess. Finishing off the Fry was a gargantuan pile of Wandos thick-cut crinkle fries. Like the fish, they came out scalding hot, with some serious seasoning. While they arent cut fresh in house or anything like that, they are still great, and fried about as well as a freezer-to-fryer French fry can be done. Overall, we highly recommend the walleye at Wandos, and think it is a great value at $8.75. In our opinion, any time you can score a nice sized walleye fillet for less than $9 you are doing pretty well and Wandos delivers. While there are some lackluster items in this Fish Fry the walleye is excellent enough on its own not only to salvage the meal, but actually make it desirable. That really says something in our book. Wandos simply makes wonderful walleye, try it and I think youll agree. www.wandosbar.com/602 University AvenueMadison, WI 53715     (608) 256-5204",2461,0.19745149911816573,0.5360802469135804

Likewise, when Madison Fish Fry runs up against a plate of fried fish, you can expect much the same thing  total and utter domination. A portion of the MFF contingent was already planning to attend the game, and when I scored a seat too, I suggested that we rendezvous at Wandos since its just a stones throw from the Kohl Center. We donned our Badger red, got our sieve fingers ready, and battled the blustery winds on our way to Wandos and a Badger victory.I wound up at Wandos just after six, bounded up three flights of stairs, and found myself on the top floor amidst Jer, Paco, and Bethany. I immediately visited the bar where I procured a glass, and put in my order for Wandos famous $8 lake perch. No sooner had I rejoined the Crease Creatures than the bartender brought over my slaw and dinner roll. The roll was fairly average, but the slaw was right on the money. Im not sure if I have ever enjoyed the slaw at Wandos this much, and I had no problem eating the entire cup before the fish arrived, which did so only a few moments later. Since I was the only one eating I wasted no time when the same bartender brought the perch around. I grabbed one of the four meaty fillets and dipped it waist deep in Wandos dill-laden tartar sauce. The fish was good, but like Badgers this gusty winter eve, they didnt play the game flawlessly. For some reason the perch had a much fishier taste than normal, and the breading lacked the spice necessary to overcome it. On the whole, it was still above average, but not as mouthwatering as we have come to expect it to be. Oh well, every team dings a few off the pipe now and then. Luckily for us, Wandos took a page from the Book of Gudmandson and played solid D with their thick cut crinkle fries. They backed-up the inconspicuous perch well, helping secure the win and a MFF recommendation. The classic crinkles came in droves and actually paired better with plentiful tartar than did the fish. It was seriously no more than 15 minutes from the time I ordered until the time an empty dish sat before me. At the end of the period the bartender took advantage of the intermission to Zamboni the area clean while I grabbed another beer. This was my first time eating on the third floor and I never realized that they have a full kitchen up there before now, which I assume makes it easier to serve all three levels effectively. Consequently the service on this visit was really good, even if the fish on the third tier was just a little off. Overall, this is still a recommendable Fish Fry, even if Wandos didnt bring their A game. As art mimics life, hockey mimicked Fish Fry, and the Badgers relied heavily on their shut-out pitching net-minder to squeak out a win against a far inferior Canisius squad. Its a relief to know that even when Bucky isnt playing to his potential he can still pull out a win. Thankfully, it looks like the same can be said about Wandos. www.wandosbar.com/602 University AvenueMadison, WI 53715     (608) 256-5204",3122,0.12024801587301587,0.45804894179894184

Sure, lake perch and bluegill have their own intricate nuances, but there is just something special about a perfectly fried piece of walleye that sets it apart. Maybe it is the thick and tender fillets, or the unique taste that is akin to walleye alone? Whatever it may be, walleye is easily the lord of the lake when Fish Fry is the subject of discussion.A hunger for walleye is often accompanied by a fairly steep price tag which can easily range upwards of $20 (see: Smokeys, Buck & Honeys, Mariners Inn, or any number of others). A couple weeks back while partaking in a plate of perch at Wandos we noticed that walleye was also on their menu and for a mere $8.25 no less. Since Wandos has killer cod and near-perfect perch, we figured the walleye would fall in line. When we took into account the relatively tiny price tag, we knew what needed to be done; I grabbed Gabe, and we went wild with Wando, once more. We wandered into Wandos just before 11:30 and grabbed a second story table. As per usual, the waitress buzzed right over as soon as she saw us. She grabbed our food and drink order in one fell swoop, hit the bar/kitchen, and rebounded with the customary coleslaw and basic bun instantly. Both slaw and roll served their purpose admirably and set the table for the fish, came a few moments later. We have made numerous visits to Wandos, but for some reason have never taken the time to try the walleye, even though it seems to be the consensus among their Fish Fry patrons. More often than not, things are popular for a reason, but since I was almost certain that there was no way the Wandos walleye could surpass their perch, I couldnt bring myself to try it. The majority is the majority for a reason apparently, and we really should have paid this walleye its due sooner. The single large fillet came just as the perch or cod does: on a pile of fries with a massive cup of tartar at its side. While I normally prefer my walleye to be served in smaller pieces to increase the fish:breading ratio, the thickness of Wandos fillet melded well with its thin breading. The fish was moist and flaky and paired perfectly with the salty breading, which appears to be the same coating that adorns Wandos other fantastic fish. The flavors were well balanced between the spicy batter and tender fish, easily making this some of the best walleye we have eaten to date.Pairing with the walleye was Wandos take on tartar sauce. While the dill-heavy blend is growing on us a little, it still doesnt really improve the fish, in our opinion. While there is a fair amount of relish present, and a thick mayo base, the oversaturation of dill makes it difficult for us to exhaust the massive portion. What we did deplete were Wandos thick cut crinkle fries, even though the allotment was more than ample. These heavily seasoned potato products were fried just right, and had a reddish-gold aura that seemed to make them glow with deliciousness.  Overall, we highly recommend the walleye at Wandos. The fish itself was simply delicious, while the well above average fries held their own. The tartar is relatively inoffensive, even if it doesnt keep us coming back for more; when you throw in their average coleslaw and a roll for only $8.25, it is easily a best buy in the Madison area. A lot of places would be more than happy to charge $12+ for the same offering, but Wandos is somehow making a go of it for much less. Were not sure exactly how they are doing it, but we certainly are glad they are. Walleye is apparently the most popular option of Wandos for a reason, well, maybe a few reasons.  This is definitely an instance where the majority rules. www.wandosbar.com/602 University AvenueMadison, WI 53715     (608) 256-5204",3814,0.17621874999999998,0.5172460317460316

It had been some time since we last saw him, and after renewing our relationship with his lake perch we knew we could simply not let that that much time pass between meetings again. Since we had a special guest joining us for lunch in the form of Gabe's mom, Peg, and we both figured that a lovely lady such as Mrs. K deserved a lovely Fish Fry such as Wando's, we knew what to do. We agreed to convene at noon and when I showed up fifteen minutes or so before the hour I was taken aback to see a former acquaintance of mine, Mike Bradley bellied up to the bar.I knew Bradley from my days of painting lines for the City of Madison, but had not spoken to him in over a decade. As we reminisced I quickly realized that Mike Bradley was still Mike Bradley, and apparently comes to Wando's just about every Friday for fish. We caught up briefly and a few moments later Jerry entered. I introduced the two, and no sooner had their handshake broken than Bradley bid us adieu. He escaped to the street in search of crazy adventures, and knowing what I know about Mike Bradley, he found them. Gabe arrived in due time and his momma was not far behind. We picked a level two table, and chatted for a bit as we waited for the bubbly waitress to come by and take our orders. She arrived posthaste, obtained our orders, and was off in a flash, bound for the kitchen with perch and cod commands. She came back almost instantly with some dinner rolls and some coleslaw, which were both fine and perfectly edible, but nothing to write home about. We barely had time finish them and get into the seamy details of back home gossip before the entrees emerged. As always, I went right for the fish to see what there is to see - the view was good, my friends, a real vista. The four large perch fillets were incredibly meaty and the actual fish was fall-apart flaky. They housed a spicy breading which was very good, but not quite as peppery as it was our last trip. On the whole it was still great with or without the dilly mix that Wando's passes off as tartar sauce. The perch was placed atop a fair portion of cut crinkle fries which looked to form a very comfortable cradle for the star of the show. The fries were generously seasoned with a Lawry's-like mix which really perked them up and made me take notice. Wando's has figured out how to make incredibly flavorful fish and fries, folks, this much we know. As I pounded my last piece of perch and finished off my fries I could not help but notice that Gabe seemed to have met his match after getting 2/3 of the way through his cod.

It had been some time since we last saw him, and after renewing our relationship with his lake perch we knew we could simply not let that that much time pass between meetings again. Since we had a special guest joining us for lunch in the form of Gabe's mom, Peg, and we both figured that a lovely lady such as Mrs. K deserved a lovely Fish Fry such as Wando's, we knew what to do. We agreed to convene at noon and when I showed up fifteen minutes or so before the hour I was taken aback to see a former acquaintance of mine, Mike Bradley bellied up to the bar.I knew Bradley from my days of painting lines for the City of Madison, but had not spoken to him in over a decade. As we reminisced I quickly realized that Mike Bradley was still Mike Bradley, and apparently comes to Wando's just about every Friday for fish. We caught up briefly and a few moments later Jerry entered. I introduced the two, and no sooner had their handshake broken than Bradley bid us adieu. He escaped to the street in search of crazy adventures, and knowing what I know about Mike Bradley, he found them. Gabe arrived in due time and his momma was not far behind. We picked a level two table, and chatted for a bit as we waited for the bubbly waitress to come by and take our orders. She arrived posthaste, obtained our orders, and was off in a flash, bound for the kitchen with perch and cod commands. She came back almost instantly with some dinner rolls and some coleslaw, which were both fine and perfectly edible, but nothing to write home about. We barely had time finish them and get into the seamy details of back home gossip before the entrees emerged. As always, I went right for the fish to see what there is to see - the view was good, my friends, a real vista. The four large perch fillets were incredibly meaty and the actual fish was fall-apart flaky. They housed a spicy breading which was very good, but not quite as peppery as it was our last trip. On the whole it was still great with or without the dilly mix that Wando's passes off as tartar sauce. The perch was placed atop a fair portion of cut crinkle fries which looked to form a very comfortable cradle for the star of the show. The fries were generously seasoned with a Lawry's-like mix which really perked them up and made me take notice. Wando's has figured out how to make incredibly flavorful fish and fries, folks, this much we know. As I pounded my last piece of perch and finished off my fries I could not help but notice that Gabe seemed to have met his match after getting 2/3 of the way through his cod. Not wanting anything to go to waste, Jer and I split it and enjoyed it on his behalf. We are good like that, and were raised to not let food go to waste, so it was a total win-win situation. As we polished off the remaining morsels we mentally prepared ourselves for the rest of the day.

Recently we have made a habit of hitting the campus area establishments and have found that the Regent Street Retreat (as unpopular as it may be) has a really good Fish Fry for a really good price. We even went so far as to say that it was best deal in town regardless of location. It turns out that we may have gotten ahead of ourselves a bit on that one. Recently, we paid Wandos visit and after having a plate of their lake perch, we may be refiguring our numbers a bit.Basically we have been to Wandos a number of times and knew their fish was good, but unfortunately, on our last visit everything was seriously subpar due to the fact that we tried to hit the cozy bar with a less than cozy crew. We wound up with crummy service and fish to match. This previous experience left me less than enthusiastic about making a return trip. Since I was curious to see if Wandos did any work on the inside during their recent remodel, I proposed that we give them another try. Jer and I showed up just before noon, and a few minutes later our friends Gabe and Paul straggled in. The boisterous young waitress swung by our second story table shortly after and took our orders: three perch and one cod, at a mere eight bucks a pop. She bounded away to put in the orders and grab the complimentary Honey Weiss that came with the Fish Frys (apparently they have some promotion stating that Honey Weiss is the Official beer of Fish Fry  we disagree with that assessment, but whatever, its still free beer). She brought back the Leinies, some slaw, and a roll for each of us a few moments later. The slaw was actually pretty darn good and even Gabe had no trouble putting the bulk of it away. Mr. Paul was somewhat less enthusiastic about creamy goo, and likened it to a manila envelope on a beige wall, which I guess means he thought it was pretty plain. The roll was also fairly ordinary, but was fresh and soft, and filled the void nicely. Upon finishing these precursors we tidied up our table and prepared for the goodness which was to come.A grand total of 15 minutes or so passed before we got our fish, but when it appeared it looked fantastic. I wasted no time and took the perch to task. At first bite it was immediately apparent, this is the perch I had come to know and love. The hefty fillets were light and flaky, and sported a spicy breading which was nothing less than outstanding. For a moment I thought I had been transported to the Villa Tap and was eating the best perch in town, it was almost that good. I quickly downed my first two pieces and had to hold myself back a little to make sure I savored the flavor of the final pair. Pristine perch it was.Along with the perch was a veritable plethora of thick cut crinkle fries. The tasty tubers were well fried and covered with plenty of season salt which really helped kick them into high gear. They were spot-on, and paired perfectly with the mouth-watering perch. For some strange reason, Jer and Gabe opted for the rice alternative, and when Jer saw his plate he was immediately hit with buyers remorse. Unlike the fries which were well seasoned and delicious, the rice mixture was bland and most of it remained on his plate when all was said and done. In the battle of fries vs. rice, the fries easily won in a first round knockout. The dill laden tartar sauce didnt pair with the fish quite as well as the fries did, but at least I can see what they are going for. When you have fish with a spicy batter and super-seasoned fries, you figure someone might like the cooling flavor of dill to even it all out, right? Wrong. We at MFF could do without the dill all together, but think it would at least benefit them to tone it down a notch, especially since the rest of the ingredients in the sauce were in balance. By and large it was acceptable, but I cant say it improved the fish one bit (although this fish was definitely good enough to stand on its own so dilly sauce isnt a total loss).As we were wrapping up I noticed that one of Gabes cod fillets was sitting idle. At his behest, Jer and I snagged it up and split it in half. It seemed to enjoy the same breading as the perch but was even flakier (which I wasnt sure was even possible). Like the perch, it was simply delicious and an exceptional value at eight clams in its own right. Overall, this was simply a fantastic lunch at Wandos. Usually if you find a plate of perch this large youd expect to drop a good $12 or more. When you add in the fact that they include a beer (even if it isnt my favorite beer per se) and only charge $8, you can easily see that this is a deal to be reckoned with. Yeah, it isnt quite as cheap as the RSR, but then again, perch is more expensive than cod, and beer is more expensive than soda, so I gotta give it to them.

I was hoping that a monumental entry such as this would be saved for a great Fish Fry. Since we were meeting some people who live in Cottage Grove I figured this would be the ideal opportunity to hit up Doubleday’s again (great fish, good prices and a short drive for them). It turned out they were more interested in the glitz and glamor of downtown so I was called upon to find somewhere more appealing. I knew if we were trying to eat at 7pm the Old Fashioned and the Avenue Bar were out, so I suggested Wando’s, an overlooked Fish Fry that I have had nothing but good experiences eating.We arrived at Wando’s at 7pm, grabbed a couple beers and headed upstairs to eat with our group of 6. We took the only area that can actually accommodate a group that size and pulled some tables together. The Fish Fry options for dinner are the same as they are for lunch: cod, perch or walleye. The cod and perch are $8.00 but I’m not sure about the walleye. Since I was going with the perch everyone else tried to follow suit. We put in for 5 orders of perch and I was absolutely shocked when the waitress came back and said they only had 4. What!? It is 7 o’clock on Friday night, we are the first group of people eating dinner, you have a Fish Fry special, and you only have 4 orders for the entire night? Huh? Luckily for them we had someone who was willing to get the cod instead but running out of your special during the first table of the night is really unacceptable. The food came about 15 – 20 minutes after we ordered and was screwy even then. For starters there was an option for regular or curly fries. But when the people who ordered curly fries got their food they had waffle fries instead. Huh? We had some other friends show up later who ordered fish with curly fries and they actually got curly fries. I thought, what the hell was going on here? The old bait and switch? I was lost, it was weird.Once we got past these oddities we actually got to enjoy the fish. The perch was okay but needed to be hotter. The flavor of the fish and batter was just fine but once it starts to cool, even a little, a lot of greatness goes with it. The highlight of the meal this time was probably the regular fries which were salty and delicious. I can’t speak about the curly/waffle fries but I did notices there were a lot left on the plates at the end whereas the regular fries were long gone. Stick with regular if you have a choice.I seem to remember the tartar being a reasonable blend with hint of dill. This time it was either new recipe or mixed in different proportions because it was laden with dillyness and a lot of relish. I think I may have seen a caper in there too but can’t be sure. Wando’s is smart enough to give you the slaw and roll ahead of time which is nice since you are hungry before your fish comes and you might actually eat them. The slaw had some horseradish in it which some seemed to love while others wouldn’t touch it with a 10 foot pole. I thought it was just fine. This visit to Wando’s was not what I was hoping for. It was good enough but not the great experience I had the last time when I sat at the bar by myself and got everything fresh and hot. The service this trip with a large group was fine until time to leave. Between splitting the bill and having two waitresses servicing our group things took way too long. We waited at least 20 minutes to get the bill before another 20 minutes to get out the door. If you have group of 5 or more it is probably wise to skip Wando’s on a Friday night. The Fish Fry is tailored to a quick lunch and if you are looking for something more it isn’t there.

Since I wasn’t in a huge hurry I decided to just brace myself for the expected huge crowds and go anyway. On my way in I noticed that traffic was surprisingly light and when I got downtown the parking ramp on Francis was surprisingly empty, I was feeling a lot better about my trip by this point. Upon entering Wando’s I almost hit the floor; there was not a sole present at the bar, save for the 3 folks who were working the grill. My god I thought, there is a Badger basketball game in just over an hour and WANDO’S is empty! What is the world coming to?Wondering was going on I took as seat at the bar and waited for the polite co-ed bartender to come take my order. Wando’s has a nice variety of fish on Friday including Cod, Lake Perch and I think walleye. I opted for the $8.00 Lake Perch since I remembered it being very good the last time and I knew I was going to have Cod later in the evening and didn’t want to have the same fish twice in one day. As a precursor to the main dish I received a little basket with a roll and a cup of coleslaw. Both were fine, but nothing to write home about. They did do a nice job of bridging the short gap between ordering and consuming however. I had a clear view of the grill and fryer and saw my food go in and come out within a matter of minutes. A few seconds later it was in front of me and ready to be devoured. The Lake Perch was just as good as I remembered and maybe even a little better. It had a nice texture with a delicious batter that was light and crumbly. The French fries were also quite delectable and fried equally well to the fish. While the tartar sauce did have a slight hint of dill it was still rich and creamy and complimented the fish without drawing too much attention.Overall I was very impressed with the quality of the Fish fry at Wando’s. The most important items were all great and the periphery items, while not being outstanding, served their purpose well. The bar is pretty nice (and clean) inside and the service and hospitality were great. I still can’t believe it was that dead at 12:00 on a Friday afternoon especially with a Badger game on TV and state basketball in town but I’m glad it was, it enabled me to have an awesome Fish Fry without having to fight the crowd to get it. I am going to have to make a conscious effort to make it Wando’s more often. This is a great little Fish Fry for a fair price.

The cod was good, not greasy, and not too creamy. It was flaky and tasted pretty fresh. The crinkle cut fries were hot and well (but not overly) seasoned.

This is just a good solid Fry at a fair price with no real bells and whistles. Its straight to the point and straight-up recommendable in our book.At lunch golfers (and the general public) can swing away with a 4-piece lake perch or 3-piece cod for $9.25. This Friday we were the first customers of the day despite the fact it was already after the noon hour. As such, our food came alarmingly fast and looked crisp. For starters the lake perch is the real deal yellow perch, and has the light texture youd expect. Its home to a wispy beer batter that matches the texture of the fish just right. It also tastes of celery salt and cumin which is something we can definitely get behind. Of course, for only $9.25 the portion is going to be on the small side but that actually makes for a good lunch. The cod is also conservatively portioned and shares the same batter as the perch. The crunchy coating seems to work equally well on both which is a hallmark of good batterlike Franks Red Hot, you can put that $hit on everything! Curly fries and regular fries are available and we sampled both this time around. While they undoubtedly come from big brown freezer packs they are tasty and fried to perfection. The inherent seasoning on the curlies are reminiscent of the best of Hardees, while the regular had a little salt sprinkled on them fresh from the fryer so it stuck. We liked both just fine, and would recommend either depending on our mood. The tartar was somewhere in the middle consistencywise, kind of like a 4 Iron or some other middling club. It had a strong flavor but didnt spread out on the palate and didnt shoot for the green. It was solid, but not special. Similar to leaving a putt short, there is a noticeable absence of bread with this Fish Fry. Oh what might have been with a little more oomph, or a little more starch. Luckily, the slaw was good enough and, like everything else, came in slightly under par. While were not going to tell you have to run right out and get this Fish Fry its certainly a nice one to have in the bag. Sometimes you need to pull that one club that no one else is using and see what it can do. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry, and will keep it in our arsenal for instances when we dont want to battle the crowds but still want some solid fish. golfthebridges.com2702 Shopko DriveMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-1822",2586,0.16202582728006457,0.41816446265598817

Weve all whizzed by it on our way out Aberg and while it doesnt seem like the kind of place that should have a good Fish Fry they actually doand as LeVar used to say on Reading Rainbow you dont have to take my word for it. They draw a serious crowd on Friday  take their word for it. Bridges has a cod, lake perch, walleye, and shrimp available every Friday and this week they also had bluegill on special. I stuck with the with the $13.00 3-piece cod, and opted for the default side of coleslaw instead of tacking on the basic-looking salad bar.The fish came super-fast since we were super early and looked okay but was inconsistent. Two of the hunks were very similar while one had a dramatically different appearance. Regardless, they were all tasty as the middling-quality cod was superseded by a flavorful, light and flaky batter. It featured something distinctive that was tough to decipher but totally appetizing. Was it chipotle? I dont know. Was it cumin? I cant be sure. Rest assured it was somethingsomething delicious. My choice of side was hash browns and they were as plain as can be. The cheese and onion were an upcharge and probably not worth the extra buck or so. The onions were scant, while the cheddar was simply shredded and sprinkled on top; it wasnt melted or anything. Oh well. The tartar was straightforward too and not really memorable although every drop of the ¾ full cup got eaten so it was at least passable. A standard slaw followed suit and was of the creamy persuasion with a little punch but not much. Perhaps the highlight of the meal was the crusty half-loaf of bread that arrived on a cutting board before the fish. It was served with some sweetened whipped butter that really cranked it up a notch. Its only downfall was the dull knife that came with it and its inability to penetrate the formidable crust. *SQUISH* If youre like me you watched a lot of Reading Rainbow as a kid as it was must see TV for the 6-12 crowd. If nothing else the show taught us how cool reading was and how not to simply take one guys word for anything. The Fish Fry at Bridges on the Green is kind of like reading in that it may not seem cool and you may not want to believe me when I say it is, but all you have to do is try it for yourself. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and go ahead and you can take our word for it when we say you wont be disappointed if youre willing to give it a whirl. golfthebridges.com2702 Shopko DriveMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-1822",2549,0.09999516066589237,0.5254490902051877

We ate there several times back in the day and were pretty pleased, but for some reason we just kind of stopped going as we found other places to satisfy our Friday Fish cravings. Well, a couple weeks back we wound up at Bridges on a Friday for a work outing, and while fish wasnt on the companys special menu we took note of the offerings on the board and decided we needed to update their review soon. We came back to do just that the very next Friday and Im certainly glad we did.There are a couple Fish Fry options for lunch and we chose the cut-and-dry 3-piece cod for $9.00.While the pieces were on the small side, the flavor loomed large. Good things definitely come in small packages. The cod was decent quality, but had a superb beer batter that took it from ordinary to extraordinary. The intoxicating coating was ultra- flavorful with plenty of season salt, possibly some cumin, and likely a whole bunch of other secret spice. It was very satisfying, and we could definitely have eaten more. Like, lots more. Some skin-on freezer fries played second fiddle but got into the season salt spirit as well. They were reasonably portioned and a little on the limp side, but not too bad. A zesty tartar with a medium-thick consistency was provided for dipping, and while it could have been better there was certainly plenty to go around. What there wasnt plenty of was bread which was simply absent. Bah humbug. Finishing of the Fry was a creamy slaw was basically an extension of the tartar as it had a very similar flavor and consistency. It was scooped onto a lettuce leaf, which made it presentable, but hard as hell to scoop. I appreciate the showiness, but would rather be able to eat it all with ease. I could definitely have gone without it. The most important part of any Fish Fry is the fish, and Bridges made theirs count. While the fries, tartar and coleslaw were middle-of-the-road the fish shone bright and is easily enough to draw us in for another round. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and will tee-off with it again soon.golfthebridges.com2702 Shopko DriveMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-1822",2255,0.1256185807656396,0.5228478057889824

Finding somewhere with a great Fish Fry and great vegetarian options is never an easy task. Most of the places that meet these requirements have been visited already and when you are tying to find newer and greater Fish Fries it can be quite a juggling act. Since we didn’t want to drive too far I suggested Bridge’s On the Green because I knew they at least had a nice salad bar, and while it wouldn’t be new, everyone would be happy.  We arrived at Bridge’s right around the peak Fish Fry hour and had no trouble getting a table which seemed kind of strange, but whatever. Our waitress came by a little later, dropped off some menus, and went to get us some beverages. When she came back we put in our orders: 1 bluegill with fries, 1 cod with pub chips, and one salad bar. While we waited for the fish to arrive she also brought a warm loaf of bread on a cutting board which was very good and kept us satisfied during the interlude.The $13 bluegill was on the table before you could say “can you grab me something from the salad bar when you go?” The 9-10 filets were good sized and nice and hot. The batter was fairly light, but seriously seasoned and a little firm which actually made the fish easier to hold on to. Gabe opted for the cod which looked great, but was not really hot resulting in it being a little chewy. I assume if it would have been scalding hot it would have been much better, but he seemed to enjoy it either way. The bluegill again hit the mark and was so plentiful I barely got into the last piece.The French fries were also quite good. They looked homemade as they were fatter than normal and had the skins on. Like the fish there were served in a hearty portion leaving me in no danger of running out. The tartar sauce was also plentiful and had some chili or chipotle spice in it that really kicked it up a notch.  It was tasty and worked well with both the seasoned bluegill and the homemade fries.Usually I don’t put too much stock in coleslaw. It can’t really ruin a Fish Fry but it can’t put it over the top either. The slaw at Bridge’s was gooey and fairly decent, but didn’t really do it for me. The service was also decent, but could have been better considering they were not that busy.The Bridges is a public golf course and being such draws a different crowd than a lot of places in Madison. They are older and certainly more conservative, the kind of folks who like a nice inoffensive Fish Fry. Bridge’s knows what they are after and caters to them, creating an environment which is kind of sterile. However, when push comes to shove the food is good, the place is clean, and everyone leaves satisfied. I can easily recommend the bluegill and will probably try the cod again sometime soon.golfthebridges.com2702 Shopko DriveMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-1822",2895,0.28270824605502015,0.5505955872084906

I am never sure if I should attribute it to golfers playing a round or other folks hitting up the dining room for the all day Fish Fry. This Friday it was Halloween and I noticed that the parking lot was not quite as full so I figured this would be a good day to try their Fish Fry again since the last time we went it was packed and the service was terrible.This trip was dramatically different. We wrapped up our Trick-or-Treating handouts about 7:45 and arrived at Bridges around 8:00. I was very surprised at exactly how few diners there were. They were actually closing up shop for the night since there were only about five groups of people in the place. Regardless, we were hungry and ready for fish so we took a seat at one of the many available tables. As soon as we sat down our waitress was at the table taking our drink orders (I suspect the waitress were eager to get out early this Halloween to hit up some festivities of their own). She brought our drinks back lickety-split and took our dinner orders. On Fridays Bridges has a lovely variety of fried fish to choose from. Beer battered cod is $9 on special and the Beer battered Lake Perch is $12. I went for the (non-beer battered) Bluegill for $13.After our order went in it could have been no longer than 5 minutes before the food was out of the kitchen and in front of us. The Bluegill was excellent. It was not fishy tasting at all and had a lovely, light batter, sprinkled with some spice (Rosemary?) which was delicious. The French fries were thin cut (almost shoestring) style and were ungodly hot. They were also very good, although not overly plentiful. The tartar sauce was also great and had me scarping the bottom of the cup with seventh and final piece of fish. I knew the Bluegill was good, but I didnt remember it being this good. Needless to say, I was a happy camper. Gabe got the cod (because he always does) and was underwhelmed. The beer batter just didnt do it for him and as I have found it can be very difficult to do beer battered cod well.Before the fish came we got an awesome loaf of warm bread served on a cutting board with a knife to cut it yourself, simply the best way you can get it. The coleslaw that came with my fish was also very good and I ate almost all of it. Overall the food was spectacular, and served lighting quick due to lack of patrons.The service this trip was great, especially compared with our previous visit. Much of this can be attributed to the fact we were one of the only groups in the place, but at least this didnt make our waitress complacent. She was very attentive and did a great job.Overall this was a great Fish Fry. We got in and our in less than an hour and had some fantastic fish to boot. I can safely say the Bluegill is worth a trip but I would be hesitant on the beer battered options since the last time I went they were not great and this time they were not a lot better. Try Bridges on the Green if you are in the mood for a nice plate of Bluegill at a nice place on the East side.golfthebridges.com2702 Shopko DriveMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-1822",3205,0.24222922502334274,0.58577964519141

It's easy to get hooked on and it's interesting to follow other food blogger type people. One such person I follow (and who follows me back) is the Chicago BBQ King (@chibbqking). This guy is a bit like me - he hits up divey places like roadside hamburger stands and neighborhood taverns - places that are known to have good (but not necessarily picturesque) food. He also travels to Wisconsin with some regularity and appreciates our state's culture of beer, cheese, brats, bars, Fish Frys, camaraderie and the like. He's actually reached out to me a couple times and asked where he should go get fish when he's in town. He always wants freshwater fish so I usually recommend the best I know - the Villa Tap, Dexter's Pub, or Toby's Supper Club. Sometimes he takes my advice, but the last time he went off-script and wound up at Brothers Three. After seeing the pictures he posted I knew I needed to go back ASAP since things looked improved since the last time I visited the old gas station.First and foremost, Brothers Three looks like a dump on the outside, and I think that scares a lot of people off. Take my word for it, don't be scared; once you get inside it's a classic Wisconsin tavern and has a rather impressive menu (including what I've heard is the best Prime Rib in town on Saturday nights). The Friday Fish Fry list is also extensive and while it has plenty to choose from and I stuck with the $14.25 6-piece perch this week. This plate of perch was pretty much immaculate and exactly what I was hoping for after seeing the King's photo. They've upped the seasoning quotient in their light and crumbly breading over the years and it really takes things to a whole nother level. The fish is also the real deal yellow perch which is sweet and smooth, and becoming harder and harder to find these days, especially for under $15 a plate. The fries were about as basic as fries can get and whereas the amount of fish was one heavy compared to most places, the portion of spuds was slightly conservative. A whopper of a tartar comes two cups strong and is reminiscent of the finest supper club sauces out there. It's thick and clingy, with a tremendous tartness the plays of the succulent perch just right. Sharing a basket with said sauce are a couple basic dinner rolls that just do the job, but pair admirably with the 4 oz. cup of standard creamy and soupy slaw. While social media can certainly be dumping ground for all sorts of half-baked opinions and ridiculous memes it can also be a place of enlightenment and information sharing. I obviously much prefer those later aspects and have to say I've found many of my favorite places thanks to things others have liked and shared (and I'm not just talking about Fish Fry joints either). Overall, we highly recommend the lake perch Fish Fry at Brothers Three and think that opinion is worth sharing... And we hope you like that we did it...

They just do what they do, make what they make, and do it day in and day out. They could remodel, but they dont. They could advertise, but you wont see that either. This dude simply is who he is like it or not. Ive always had a thing for B3, whether it be the funky gas-station awning that overhangs almost the entire parking lot, or ex-con-looking bartender with a supposed heart of gold. Its one of the most unique places in Madison, and most importantly they take their Fish Fry seriously. Ive had the Bros cod and it alright. Ive had his perch and its a bit better. Now Ive had his walleye, and while it didnt blow me away it did serve notice that these fellas know what they are doing. The fillet comes in at $16.00 and is pan-fried with a multitude of colorful seasonings. While the pan part of the equation isnt mentioned anywhere on the menu I have no doubt that a skillet was involved instead of a vat of boiling oil. Wally is lavishly seasoned to the point where he has an orange hue with little specs of pepper, dill, and lord knows what else. While the fillet wasnt husky (it almost looked like it had been pounded flat) it was still large albeit plank-like. While the pressure added to the pan caused it to lose some of its flaky nature it was still delectable but impossible to handle. This is a fork fillet if ever there was one. Skin-on, straight-cut freezer fries serve as the side and are really well fried. While the tubers appear to share their bath with the other deep fried fish (as they had a subtle fishy essence) it didnt bug me, but Im sure some would find it a huge turnoff. Borthers Three Achilles heel has always been their tartar which was a dill-laden disaster. At some point a change was made and the sauce of today is thick and zesty with the perfect mayo:relish ratio. My prayers have clearly been heard which is going to make it much easier to justify subsequent visits. The old tartar really was that bad. Prior to the fish some soft rolls hit the table. These baps were seriously good and while they looked like grandmas basic buns they were alluring and almost seemed to have notes of cinnamon. I thought maybe it was cinnamon butter, but the packets were just standard issue so Im not sure where that came from, maybe just in my head, but wherever it was I took notice. Im not sure Ive ever been so happy to see a place make a change to their Fish Fry as I am that Brothers Three has new tartar sauce. That stuff was literally a deal breaker and now that I know its history I can hardly wait to come back and try their lake perch with a sauce that does it justice. Overall, we recommend the walleye at Brothers Three and put it somewhere between the cod and perch in the B3 hierarchy. www.facebook.com/Brothers-Three-Bar-Grill-120351497981828/614 North Fair Oaks AvenueMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-6818",2937,0.1149548622109598,0.4887868229331643

From the most famous supper clubs to lesser known dive bars, and anywhere in between, if theyre serving fish theyre fair game for big crowds and long waits. This fight for fish is part of the fun of Lenten Fridays in Wisconsin and something we here at Madison Fish Fry really enjoy (I realize we are probably in the minority here).To be fair, Brothers Three is usually pretty busy anyway, but when mid-February rolls around the intensity is bumped up a notch. We showed up at 11:30 for lunch, and the place was already already swarming, leaving us but a couple open tables to choose from. We snagged the first one we saw, and felt fortunate to get it. The waitress buzzed over as soon as she saw us and grabbed us some drinks. B3 has an impressive selection of fish on Friday although all of them are getting up there price-wise. The perch runs $13, the cod is relatively expensive at $10.75, and the walleye almost breaks the bank at $14.50. There are also some other options like Mahi-Mahi and shrimp, but you wont find MFF trolling those waters - we want fish-fish. Before your choice of fish arrives at the table, a basket of rolls will make its appearance. Our batch came with some cold butter packets, but without bread plates. We slapped some napkins down on the plastic tablecloth and went to work on them anyway, enjoying the soft buns and hand-warmed butter. Even without plates the rolls were tasty and fresh so well still chalk it up as a win. A whole basket full of tartar cups came along with the rolls, but well get into that later. The main course arrived in to time and looked just right. Nearly every inch of the plate was covered by six large lake perch fillets and a bunch of freezer-fresh fries. The perch was actually pretty good, despite a couple bones here and there. The meat was tender and supple, and paired with a light breading that was good, but could have used a hint more salt. Overall, it was pretty respectable, but could have really benefited from a good tartar. Unfortunately, the massive amount tartar provided by the Brothers was downright nasty. While I presume it was Sysco (based on the clock baring that brand name on the wall) it didnt have a familiar taste which leads me to believe it may have been doctored in some way or may have simply been a different commercially available sauce altogether. The brew was thick and creamy, but had waaaaay to much pickled relish for the fragile fish. It really reminded me of Kraft tartar (which I just cant stand), and covered up the fish, rather than complementing it.The fries were definitely Sysco and came in the big brown freezer bag we have seen so many times before. They were the high end skin-on style though, and served in a big portion, so everyone was pretty happy with them. Some creamy, but commonplace slaw finished out the Fry, and while adequate, was a little runny at the end. All things considered we were pretty happy with our Lenten excursion to Brothers Three. The fish was tasty, and everything else played its part well enough (except for the tartar). Overall, we recommend the lake perch at Brothers III, but probably wouldnt wait around for it if it got too crowded. www.facebook.com/Brothers-Three-Bar-Grill-120351497981828/614 North Fair Oaks AvenueMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-6818",3347,0.20313552188552186,0.5418229918229919

Its the kind of place that grounds you, makes you appreciate the subtle pleasures, and reminds you to not take life too seriously. It is a simple bar with good food and good people, and when I realized it had been over three years since wed paid B3 a visit, I knew what needed to be done. The construction on Northport slowed me down considerably, but I still managed to meet Gabe at the Fair Oaks foxhole just after twelve. First came a beer, then a fish order; 10 minutes later we had the goods and went to town. On Friday Brothers Three has a lot of fish specials, although of the long list, only the cod, lake perch, and catfish really fit our description of a Fish Fry. Today it was fried cod all around, although the fish we got was a far cry from the beer battered version of yesteryear. In lieu of thick beer batter, Brothers cod now features a spicy breading on substantially smaller cuts of fish. That said, the new breading was light and flavorful, but could have used a bit more flavor. There was clearly an attempt to zest it up, and while it wasnt bland, it didnt quite make it over the hump. The fish itself was flaky and not greasy, but was a little dry.Brothers Three doesnt have a ton of potato options, but the French fries were a good choice regardless. The freezer fresh, skin-on spuds were well-fried and served in a larger than average portion. They simply did what needed to be done.Three years is a long time and over a span of that length things have a tendency to change, just look at the fish However, Brothers tartar was true to its roots and remained the same old sauce. The homemade blend had a creamy mayo base, but an extremely dilly flavor. While the dill wasnt visible its flavor dominated the sauce, and I suspect that a hefty amount of pickle juice is used behind the kitchen doors. MFF likes his dill confined to dill pickles, or ever-so delicious chips which bear that name, but he is not a fan of it tainting his tartar and overwhelming his fish. This stuff did jus t that, and much of the plentiful goo went unused. Sharing the basket with the Solo cups of slaw were some standard tear-off style dinner rolls. The white buns were very average, and served with some fridge-fresh butter making spreading near impossible, and the rolls even less desirable. Finalizing the Fry was a plentiful portion of horseradish laden slaw. It was creamy, almost exclusively comprised of cabbage, but ruled by the hradish - a slaw not for the faint of heart. Brothers Three really is much better than youd expect it to be. Im sure most of the people that zoom by on Hwy 30 assume it is a total dive, with grizzly regulars who will give you the stink-eye from the second you walk in, but quite to the contrary, they draw a surprisingly diverse clientele, and have a fairly sophisticated menu (at least for a bar). They reportedly also have AMAZING burgers if that is your thing, but weve never had the honor of that. Overall, we recommend the Fish Fry at Brothers Three, and will try to make it back sooner next time. Sure the sauce is dilly and the rolls are run of the mill, but the fish is good, the fries are yummy, and the service is quick and friendly. Brothers Three is good enough for me.www.facebook.com/Brothers-Three-Bar-Grill-120351497981828/614 North Fair Oaks AvenueMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-6818",3429,0.15622356376262622,0.5253463203463203

Since I was flying solo I decided I might as well build the database and find a different outlet for my Fish Fry needs. Since Brothers Three is only a short drive from my office I decided to give them a call to see what was on the menu. I remembered they offered Catfish and Cod on Fridays, but I was pleasantly surprised to hear that in addition to those two fine options they also had: Lake Perch, Walleye, Mahi Mahi, Grilled Shrimp and a few other options on special. It was a slightly difficult choice but I settled on the Lake Perch for $11.75. Brothers Three is practically located under Commercial Avenue at the intersection of Fair Oaks Avenue. It is that kind of creepy looking place you have driven past 1000 times that appears to have been a gas station at one time and when you drive by you say Is that a restaurant or an old gas station that they turned into a used car lot? The inside is not a whole lot nicer but as I have found, these kinds of dive bars often have very good Friday Fish Fry. I arrived at Brothers Three and sat at the bar since it was just me. I put in my order for the Lake Perch and waited. About 15 minutes later my fish was up and ready. The grill and fryer at Brothers Three is easily visible from the bar so I was able to see the cook get my perch from the kitchen, fry it up and serve it to me boiling hot. The perch was very good, bordering on excellent. It had a slight fishy taste and a firm, dark batter which was good, but not as flavorful as you sometimes find on perch. I liked the fish but the tartar sauce almost ruined it or me. While it wasnt horrible it was pretty dill flavored and didnt enhance the taste of the fish for me at all. The French fries were skin on, straight cut potatoes which were very good. The perch was slightly expensive but this was a dinner sized portion made up of 6-7 large perch filets.The coleslaw was not good at all, but the roll was actually was. I think it may be the same one you get at Wilsons but it suited me just fine. The service and atmosphere at Brothers Three leave a little something to be desired but it is a bar and you have to expect it. Overall this is a good low-key Fish Fry that wont leave you hungry. I have been to Brothers Three on three different occasions now and have never had to wait which is always a plus. I have had the cod, perch and catfish so far and I have liked the cod and the perch about equally well. If you have never been to Brothers Three you really owe it to yourself to check the place out.www.facebook.com/Brothers-Three-Bar-Grill-120351497981828/614 North Fair Oaks AvenueMadison, WI 53704     (608) 244-6818",2812,0.16709478021978022,0.5474038461538462

What on gods green earth could all this be about, we wondered. Like any good Wisconsinite, the Fish Fry part made perfect sense to us, what was peculiar was the a Go Go ending. What could this possibly have to do with the majesty that is the Fish Fry? Sure, we have heard of dinner and dancing, but a Fish Fry and a band? Now that is an intriguing concept. Needless to say, we a Went Went to The East Side Club to see what this a Go Go was all about. Upon pulling into the lot at the former East Side Businessmens Association it was instantly apparent that Jer, Grahm, and I would be looking elsewhere for parking on this most hectic of Friday nights. Luckily for our hungry trio, we found a spot directly across the street, put the car in park, and wasted no time leapfrogging a bustling Monona Drive bound for the buffet beyond. We procured a spot in the line, put our name on the list, paid our dues, and proceeded to the bar to enjoy libations and await our partys placement in the parlor. We briefly discussed the Packers prospects for the upcoming weekend and within 10 minutes our table was prepared. We set our beers down and made our way to the buffet to conjure up some cod and pounce on the provided perch. As we made our way through the line I tried to stay focused and not veer too much form the Fish Fry staples, although I was tempted by the broasted chicken, numerous casseroles, and side dishes. I eventually gave in to the spaghetti, taking a tiny portion along with my bounty of French fries, but somehow mustered up the will power to resist the soup and salad bar. Eventually we found ourselves at the end of the line and noticed the cod had run dry. Fear not, more was soon delivered, and all the better for us since it was fresh from the kitchen and as hot as can be. We loaded up and scurried back to the table to see what was what. The cod at the ESC comes in miniscule pieces, but if you take enough of them they add up. I grabbed a good 6-7 of the small segments and was glad I did. They were simply scrumptious, sporting a splendid breading with a sensuous amount of spice. I quickly polished off all of my nuggets with the help of my own personal massive cup of tartar. In actuality, the tartar was not tremendous, and didnt improve the cod, but was enough to do the job. It was a little heavy on the relish which dominated the mayo underlayment as well as the dollop of dill present. The overall taste sensation of cod and tartar was still above average, but the cod pulled most of that weight. After polishing off plateful #1 we proceeded to the buffet yet again, this time in search of perch.  My second plateful was adorned with just as many of the battered crinkle cut fries and nearly as much perch as cod came along on the first trip. The perch was actually pretty decent, but could not hold a candle to the cod. It was a little fishier (as one would expect) but whatever the breading was, it was nowhere near as well done as the cod was. In fact, Grahmer didnt like it one bit and made this fact known. With a plateful of each in me, I decided that my third and final portion had to be cod. While I didnt go full-bore, I did manage to wrangle up another four or so chunks and another handful of the crispy, and surprisingly tasty, fries. Due to the fact that I gorged myself on fried goods I totally overlooked the basket of rolls and the coleslaw on the salad bar, somewhat purposefully, but also somewhat regretfully. Jer did manage to dip into the slaw and found it to be really good, so we will take his word for it - he has been there and done that. When all was said and done we grabbed some cookies and rice crispy bars off the dessert cart and made our way to the tiki bar to see what the a Go Go was all about. It turned out that it was a basically a lounge act, fronted by a wig wearing, glitzed-out geriatric and her band of misfits. It was somewhat interesting to see, although the music left a little something to be desired. We grabbed a beverage, tried to avoid a couple of belligerent drunk dudes, and listened to their last few tunes. They wrapped up at 8:30 and with that we bid the East Side Club adieu. It was a bit of a weird end to what was actually a pretty tasty Fish Fry. I would say we had a good time at the East Side Club and all left in high spirits. The buffet was certainly plentiful and well worth the $12, especially if you are packin a big appetite. While the food was not outstanding, it was certainly good enough and there are plenty of options to choose from, even if you dont like fish (gasp). Overall, I would definitely recommend the Friday Fish Fry buffet at the East Side Club, although I could certainly have gone without the a Go Go part. In the end it worked for them though, it piqued our interest and got us in the door, and I have to assume we werent the only ones. If you are in the mood for Fish Fry and want to make sure you get filled up, try the East Side Club. If you are in the mood for cheesy lounge acts, they have you covered there as well. I guess you could say The East Side Club covers their bases, whatever those bases happen to be.escmadison.com3735 Monona DriveMadison, WI 53714     (608) 222-9131",5242,0.1179864612511671,0.522235294117647

Even though there are lakes all over the place, relatively few eating establishments actually exist on their shores which is a bit of a conundrum, especially when you consider how popular these lakeside lunch spots are in other parts of the state. Those that do exist get their share of business, although the crowds tend to be older, the food more plain, and the experience underwhelming (at least when you consider what they have to work with). You find a lot of B Fish Frys at these kind of places, which is pretty much what we got this time around at the Green Lantern.Norb and I rolled into the McFarland mainstay for a quick lunch and had a few tables to choose from in the Please Seat Yourself section. Our waitress came by immediately and shot off to grab us some menus. The lunch special at the Greenie is a $7 3-piece cod, so we both just went with that since it was quick and easy. The food arrived in the blink of an eye, proving once again that our waitress was really on her game. As soon as I saw the plate I knew that things at the Lantern had changed. The cod was no longer the thickly beer battered fillets of yore, instead it was cut into thin strips and lightly breaded. The trio was tiny, but not totally out of line for lunch or for $7. The fish itself was flaky and pure, while the breading had a little spice, but could have used a hint more. Overall, it was just a nice inoffensive fish, but there simply wasnt much of it, and a far cry from the AYCE if yesteryear. While the fish thrived on its own, it narrowly averted destruction by the treacherous tartar. The sauce awaited our arrival at the table in a big squeeze bottle, and was warm and dilly (which is never a good combo). While it wasnt runny, it wasnt thick either, and unlike most tartars actually made fish taste a little worse. I laid off it for the most part. The hash browns with cheese and onion, on the other hand, were superb. They were fried just right  a little crispy on the outside, and soft and gooey on the inside. They were delectable, and seemed to fill out the plate better than a side of fries would have (although Norb got the seasoned fries and said they were really good as well). A big old glass dish of slaw towered above the plate and was chock-full of goodness. The slaw was simply excellent, with an ideal consistency, a good zip, and minimal slaw-water left at the end. It was truly top-notch, just like the slice of home baked white bread. So soft. So squishy. So yummy. While there are a dozen or so lakeside restaurants in Madison, Im not sure there is one that is truly amazing and takes everything to the next level (which is a bit of a shame). Yes, there are some good ones and I think its fair to lump the Greenie into that group (maybe towards the upper end though, B+?). I really liked the bread, the slaw, and the hash browns, but the tartar left something to be desired as did the portion if fish. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and think it was good, but needs a little tweaking to make it great. www.thegreenieonthelake.com/4412 Sigglekow RoadMcFarland, WI 53558     (608) 270-3600",3224,0.18565162907268168,0.4911445279866334

The tartar sauce is always in a big squeeze bottle that just sits at the table which is never good. It is somewhat unappetizing and doesn't taste that great anyway. The Lake Perch was decent but unremarkable. Usually with LP you get some kind of spicy batter with some flavor, this was just kind of bland.

We know we are always going to get great fish, good sides, and not have to wait forever to get them which is more than enough to keep us coming back.For being a Friday the Beach was relatively quiet, but that didnt bother us one bit. We basically had our choice of tables and just grabbed one in the old smoking section since it was right near the bar. It took a good five minutes for our well-seasoned waitress to make her initial appearance, but once she broke the ice she was back fairly frequently. The fish list at the Beachhouse is impressive as any and pretty much features every frying fish under the sun. From cod to lake perch, and bluegill to walleye, youll find them all on special at the house  hell, they even have smelt for those who really want to get freaky. In addition to single orders of any of the aforementioned fish, they also had a perch/bluegill combo on special this Friday which was incredibly tempting So tempting in fact, that Jer just couldnt help himself. Before any fish made its way to our table we got a full mini-loaf of white bread slices with the BHs signature honey butter. The squishy starch served as the perfect conveyance for the sweet spread, and basically devoured every last bit of it. Our soup/salad option also came before the fish, and while Jers chowder was made in house, he remarked that is was just so-so. My slaw was much better and the cool and creamy concoction really hit the mark.  It was just as a slaw should be. While the smelt entrée goes for ten bucks, you can get an appetizer version for seven skins, and thats just what we did. Our mammoth plateful showed up about five minutes after wed polished off the bread and looked divine. The pile of petite bites was flanked by a couple tubs of tartar, and we wasted no time getting after them. The smelt were lightly dusted with a well-seasoned breading which was simply superb. They were so good (some of the best weve had), they definitely give the North Bristol Sportsmans Clubs smelt a run for their money. We had no problem polishing off every one of the sassy smelt, and before long Jers combo and my walleye wandered in. As per usual, the walleye fillet was huge  fat, juicy, and pristine. Unfortunately, the breading lacked the seasoning we accustomed to (the same stuff that seemingly graced the smelt) which left us wanting more of it. Yes, the fish was still great, but not as great as legend in our memory. Jers bluegill was also dynamite. The fillets were large and meaty, but the combo only featured two of them. The duo buddied up with a couple lake perch fillets which were fine (according to Jer), but like the walleye, lacked the expected spice. For our potato we both picked the hash browns with cheese and onion and they turned out to be fine, but had a very a prominent crispy layer. Jers were actually on the burned side of done, while mine were closed to over-fried, but still edible. It seems the BH philosophy is basically fry the hell out of one side, add some cheese and onion, and fold it over into a big hash brown taco. When its not totally burned the crunchy coating plays off against the gooey cheesy interior, but when it is, it makes for one unhappy Jer. A terrific tartar joined cavalcade, and bordered on perfection. The slick sauce was thick and creamy and perked the fish up without overpowering it (which is exactly what tartar is supposed to do). While this wasnt the perfect Fish Fry, it was still better than 90% of the fish youre going to find out there. Sure, its not Tobys, but it also doesnt come with the hour+ wait that Tobys does. Overall, we highly recommend the smelt, walleye and the bluegill we had this visit, and loved the no pressure atmosphere the Beachhouse affords. It was simply a great meal, and from now on any time were up for a relaxing Fish Fry, were hitting the Beach. www.thebeachhouserestaurantandbar.com4506 Larson's Beach RoadMcFarland, WI 53558     (608) 838-7248",4137,0.26318578135479537,0.49472278113123175

Our soup/salad option also came before the fish, and while Jers chowder was made in house, he remarked that is was just so-so. My slaw was much better and the cool and creamy concoction really hit the mark.  It was just as a slaw should be. While the smelt entrée goes for ten bucks, you can get an appetizer version for seven skins, and thats just what we did. Our mammoth plateful showed up about five minutes after wed polished off the bread and looked divine. The pile of petite bites was flanked by a couple tubs of tartar, and we wasted no time getting after them. The smelt were lightly dusted with a well-seasoned breading which was simply superb. They were so good (some of the best weve had), they definitely give the North Bristol Sportsmans Clubs smelt a run for their money. We had no problem polishing off every one of the sassy smelt, and before long Jers combo and my walleye wandered in. As per usual, the walleye fillet was huge  fat, juicy, and pristine. Unfortunately, the breading lacked the seasoning we accustomed to (the same stuff that seemingly graced the smelt) which left us wanting more of it. Yes, the fish was still great, but not as great as legend in our memory. Jers bluegill was also dynamite. The fillets were large and meaty, but the combo only featured two of them. The duo buddied up with a couple lake perch fillets which were fine (according to Jer), but like the walleye, lacked the expected spice. For our potato we both picked the hash browns with cheese and onion and they turned out to be fine, but had a very a prominent crispy layer. Jers were actually on the burned side of done, while mine were closed to over-fried, but still edible. It seems the BH philosophy is basically fry the hell out of one side, add some cheese and onion, and fold it over into a big hash brown taco. When its not totally burned the crunchy coating plays off against the gooey cheesy interior, but when it is, it makes for one unhappy Jer. A terrific tartar joined cavalcade, and bordered on perfection. The slick sauce was thick and creamy and perked the fish up without overpowering it (which is exactly what tartar is supposed to do). While this wasnt the perfect Fish Fry, it was still better than 90% of the fish youre going to find out there. Sure, its not Tobys, but it also doesnt come with the hour+ wait that Tobys does. Overall, we highly recommend the smelt, walleye and the bluegill we had this visit, and loved the no pressure atmosphere the Beachhouse affords. It was simply a great meal, and from now on any time were up for a relaxing Fish Fry, were hitting the Beach. www.thebeachhouserestaurantandbar.com4506 Larson's Beach RoadMcFarland, WI 53558     (608) 838-7248",4138,0.26318578135479537,0.49472278113123175

Well, its known to those of us who have been around the Madison area for a while at least. Their claim to fame is their Sunday morning walleye and eggs which is an iconic dish, oft mentioned alongside staples like Bobs Bad Breath Burger and The Old Fashioned Cheese Curds as Madison-musts. Since we prefer to eat-in on Sunday mornings for the most part, but still have a lust for walleye, we figured wed just swing by on a Friday since (from all accounts) the walleye served is one in the same. We had friends visiting from out of town, so we made a reservation, which the BH gladly accepted. Our septet arrived dockside just after 7:00, and our corner table was ready and waiting. The cozy dining room was full for the most part, and once our group was situated our old pro of a waitress came right over. As any good waitress does, she checked on our drinks first and foremost, and put in the necessary orders which also included some curds (cause Ruthie just cant go without). When she returned with the beverages orders for fish went in. Cod, lake perch, bluegill, and walleye were all represented by our group of fish lovers, and the sheer diversity made MFF proud to be associated with this bunch. The pre-fish options included coleslaw, soup, or salad, of which yours truly went for the slaw. The homemade-looking mix was tangy and creamy, and came in a bowl large enough for two. Others tried the supper club standard soups and salads which looked fine from outward appearances. The curds also made their way in around this time, and disappeared quickly. They were gooey and delicious, and could well have been Sysco, but it wasnt like we gave a damn. We devoured them. And if all that wasnt enough, a couple baskets of white bread hit the table to boot. The soft bread came complete with some sort of cinnamon apple butter that was nothing less than delicious. Our waitress was on the spot, and as soon as the precursors were expended she had our fish ready to go - fresh from the fryer, and hot, hot, hot!The steaming hot fish warmed my heart and I tore into the massive walleye with reckless abandon. The thick fillet housed a ton of meat, and dawned a lovely breading. The fish itself was pristine, and while it was a big fish, it didnt have that reeky, musky, flavor some of the older ones get. It was light and sweet, and blended perfectly with spicy breading. When it comes to walleye, light breading with subtle spices is the name of the game and The Beachhouse has it down to a science. With the abundance of species around the table I couldnt help but try the bluegill and the cod (the perch somehow eluded my hook). Like its freshwater brethren, the bluegill had the same breading and was equally great. It wasnt fishy tasting or have the rubbery texture that bad bluegill is infamous for. The cod was also good, and appeared to have the same (or at least a very similar) coating. The fish was supremely flaky, and even though the piece I tried wasnt scalding hot, it still tasted great. Well done, BH. Well done!When the fish is this good, the rest of the meal tends to pale by comparison and that was more or less The Beachhouses fate. The hash browns with cheese and onion I received were tasty, and clearly made fresh in-house, but were a bit too crispy around the edges resulting in about ¼ of the dish being too burned for my tastes. The tartar was a good blend with some zip and a good consistency, but a bit too unique with some elements that were hard to pin down. It almost kept up with the fish, but like I say, since the fish could stand on its own two fins, the tartar was more or less an afterthought.As we were heading back to Madison on 51 we passed by our old favorite  Tobys and couldnt help but notice the overflowing parking lot  Tobys was hopping (as it rightfully should be.) But it got me to thinking... while The Beachhouse was busy, it wasnt Tobys-busy. There were no 90 minute waits, no cramming in around the bar, and no hoping a waitress actually sees you and takes your order But when it comes right down to it, there really isnt that much difference between the two establishments. If Tobys is an A, wed say The Beachhouse is and A-, and in the end, the shorter wait time may be worth it for a lot of folks - I know that it would appeal to us on certain nights. Sure, Tobys is better all around, but the jump is not as big as you might think, and in fact, the BHs walleye is likely the better of the two.

The Beachhouse is located right on Lake Waubesa, just a stones throw from The Green Lantern. I called ahead to make a reservation after last weekends total debacle at the Avenue and was reassured by the hostess or bartender that they were not too busy and we didn’t even need one. When we arrived this was not the case.We had a fairly large party (6) and wound up waiting a good 25 minutes to get seated. We had to wait for two side by side tables to open up which it turned out were not even necessary. After sitting down at our two tables and assessing the situation it was quickly apparent that we could get by with one, especially since one of the two was incredibly lopsided and practically tipping over. We all moved to one table and pushed the other out of the way. If the Beachhouse would have realized this was possible we probably could have been seated immediately, as it was we waited. I chalk this up to poor management of the dining room. Once we got this initial confusion out of the way it was time to order. The Beachhouse has about every kind of fish you could expect at a Fish Fry. The Cod was $10, Lake Perch and Bluegill were $12, and the Walleye was $14 (I think). Out of the five fish eaters at our table two had Cod, two had Bluegill and one had Walleye. In particular I was one of the two Bluegill eaters. The Bluegill was actually pretty good, although really fishy tasting. The batter was light and the fish was still fairly flaky but did have a slight elasticity common with Bluegill. The French fries were crinkle cut style and good, but not great. The tartar sauce was the same as our first visit which was good, but does have some dill in it which really overpowers the relish flavor. Overall it was just fine though. I did manage to try the Cod which was also good, but not spectacular. It was far greasier than the Bluegill and had a good flavor even though it was kind of heavy. What I did not manage to get my hands on was the Walleye which supposedly was awesome. Apparently this is their best Fish option and they serve it on Sunday mornings as well in a Walleye and eggs platter. If/when we go back it will be for the Walleye or the Lake Perch.The bread served was a very plain roll which was fine but not outstanding. For starters they give an option of coleslaw/cottage cheese/house salad or soup. I opted for a salad this time which was good but nothing outstanding either. At least everything on it tasted fresh.Overall the food was good but the wait was not. The one thing that salvaged this Fish Fry and makes it recommendable was the fact that our waitress was great. She was lively and had no problem with a fairly rowdy group and three separate checks. The Beachhouse is a classic Wisconsin style Supper Club but their Fish Fry just has not done it for me. I feel fine recommending it but if I were to tell someone from out of town the best place to grab fish on a Friday they would probably not jump to the front of the list.www.thebeachhouserestaurantandbar.com4506 Larson's Beach RoadMcFarland, WI 53558     (608) 838-7248",3227,0.2566763274390393,0.542103847188593

She was lively and had no problem with a fairly rowdy group and three separate checks. The Beachhouse is a classic Wisconsin style Supper Club but their Fish Fry just has not done it for me. I feel fine recommending it but if I were to tell someone from out of town the best place to grab fish on a Friday they would probably not jump to the front of the list.www.thebeachhouserestaurantandbar.com4506 Larson's Beach RoadMcFarland, WI 53558     (608) 838-7248",3227,0.2566763274390393,0.542103847188593

For a brief period we thought they had the best Fish Fry in town and although we've had a lot of good fish since then, and they've fallen in our ranking because of it, we still think this is a damn good Fish Fry.Now, the Friday special of record at the 'squire is the AYCE ocean perch, and it's a doozy of a deal. It's not unusual for a gentleman to eat 10, 12, 15, or even 20 pieces of the finely cut fillets without thinking twice about it. Of course, we all know OP isn't ""traditional"" or necessarily ""high quality"" but who really cares when it tastes this good? Certainly not me. Since we came for lunch this Friday we decided to go for the cheaper, and seemingly more appropriately portioned $8.25 lunch special...that's a choice we wont be making again. While the fish was still tasty, grease-free, and flaky, the portion was minuscule. Only four pieces of the perch were on the plate and they were tiny buggers to boot. While the were devoid of fishy tastes they were also devoid of satisfaction since they equated to four big bites, or eight small ones. As the Esquire is essentially a supper club they serve the standard supper club style French fries. The portion was slightly better on this front although their shell shed the salt leaving the tubers are basic as can be. Thick and creamy is the name of the tartar game when the subject is supper clubs and this sauce was as bold as they come. It effortlessly wrangled the perch and made it something more. A couple squishy slices of real rye bread came on the side as if to say, ""you think this Fish Fry isn't legit, well here's a traditional side for ya to prove you wrong."" A thick and creamy slaw also did it's part to silence the critics with a little saccharine sweetness in a big old cup. This is a tough one since this was basically the same Esquire experience we've always had, but just on a much smaller scale. The food was good, and so was the price, but there was just far too little fish to go around. Overall, we still recommend this Fish Fry, but will always go for the AYCE from now on, it's more than worth the extra few bucks.  www.esquireclubmadison.com1025 N.

The perch is legendary in local circles, with the endless portion being one of its main attractions. While we love the plentiful perch, sometimes we dont feel up to the AYCE task or just flat-out have a craving for something else, and thats what happened today.It had been a while since we had the lake perch at the Esquire, and since we were there for lunch, it made sense to pass on the AYCE and branch out with some of its freshwater brethren. While the Esquire is one of the few supper clubs that doesnt have a salad bar, they still give you a soup/salad option (even at lunch). The clam chowder that made its way to our table was homemade, and creamy, but didnt have much of the good stuff (thats clam in case you were wondering). It arrived at the same time as the huge loaf of real rye bread slices that were incredibly abundant and incredibly stanky. Not long after polishing off the soup, the lake perch arrived, looking as unimpressive as ever. For your $12.50 youre only allotted four fillets, a handful of fries and a standard Solo of tartar. The perch was light and tasty, and featured the same breading that graces the ocean perch. While the muted breading really compliments the fishier OP, it really doesnt do much for the LP in comparison. To truly be effective it needs a little more seasoning, and while it was still appetizing it needed something more to take it over the top. Even more unimpressive were the standard crinkle-cut fries. While the portion was adequate for lunch they were incredibly basic, and like the fish, when not served AYCE lose a lot of their luster. Luckily, the Esquire is schooled in the sauce and their tartar was absolutely perfect. It was thick and creamy with a sweet zip that perks up even the most blandly breaded fish.While we may come off a bit harsh in this review, it is just because the Esquire has set such a high standard that even they cant always reach it. Everything was still very good, but a shade below what we were expecting. Overall, we still highly recommend the lake perch at the Esquire Club, but will likely stick with the AYCE ocean perch from here on out. www.esquireclubmadison.com1025 N.

While that may sound a little cliché at times, other times it really does hold true. Case and point: Kavanaughs Esquire Club on Madisons east side. While the place may look a little sketchy on the outside, it is their inner beauty that steals the show  namely their All You Can Eat ocean perch. Now, you may not know exactly what an ocean perch is, and you probably shouldnt even care, but if you do, the answer varies depending on which source you get your info from. As far as were concerned it is an ocean fish (sometimes called Rose Fish) that falls on the fish deliciousness hierarchy somewhere between the disgusting Pollock and the delectable cod. Thus, it should just taste okay, but there is something in the air (or the breading) at the Esquire. While we may never be sure how they turn trash to treasure the OP at the Esquire is simply superb. While the fish itself is a little fishy tasting it is combined with a deliciously light and crumbly batter that overcomes any less than desirable elements. When this mixture meets the near perfect tartar sauce a euphoric taste experience is achieved. For $11.50 it is a fair value, and since it is AYCE if for one reason or another you do get a truly sub-par piece of fish you can simply pass it over and grab another, but I have to say, of all the times I have been here I can barely remember any sub-par pieces - The Esquire is consistently that good. While we usually dont care for assembly line style Fish Frys, we can look past it at the Esquire since the quality doesnt suffer as it has a tendency to do at other places. They have to meet the demand somehow, and they do it with aplomb. Not all places include fries with their All You Can Eat Fish Fry, but since the Esquire is slingin the simple crinkles they have no problem with it. While the standard spuds arent special they are perfectly fried and adequately offset the fish top the very end. When taken in the context of the meal the sides at a Fish Fry rarely shine. In general you should be here for the fish so if anything else goes above and beyond it is basically a bonus. The Esquire is all about the bonus and their sides really shine especially the creamy, zesty coleslaw. The sliced rye loaf adds the finishing touch to this most traditional of all Fish Frys. Inside Tip: Pace yourselfDescription: Always keep in mind that this is an All You Can Eat Fish Fry and fish is always better when scalding hot. Thus, when they bring the first plate you dont need to take five pieces when you wont be able to get to them all right away. Start with three, then when the refill comes grab a couple more. The savvy fish eater will even ask for the re-up right away to avoid any downtime.*The Esquire Club is in Madison, and there is no substitute.

As a matter of fact, their AYCE ocean perch ruled our rankings for quite some time. The Northside keystone is one of Madisons few classic supper clubs, and when friends from back home come to town this is the kind of place they expect to go. We covet these kinds of places for many reasons, but you can essentially boil it down to the mantra: lots of good food, for not a lot of money.This credo used to exemplify the Esquire as you could get plateful after glorious plateful for a mere nine bucks. Well, that was back in 2007, and since then the price has steadily increased. Today it rests at $10.75, and while that is still a fair price, it doesnt exactly blow our socks off like it once did. Knowing it would be a busy one, I made a reservation for our crew at the Sherman Ave staple for 8pm. Everyone was there a few minutes early, and within 15 minutes of the quoted time, our reservation was honored. We were ushered to the big table in the corner of the main dining room where we waited and waited... and waited some more.While we waited we took stock of the basket of mixed breads and big bowl of coleslaw on the table, and also noticed that there were no plates with which to eat them. We broke etiquette and tore into the bread anyway, enjoying the radical rye, and the smooshed white  the rye much more than the white. Eventually our waitress made her appearance, and we were ready for her; she bounced around the table taking order after order for the Esquires AYCE ocean perch special. As soon as she was sure that we were mostly AYCErs she brought the plates over and let us at the slaw that smirked devilishly throughout our wait. After being tempted by the slaw for so long, it was extra delicious, and seemed to have a little more pep than normal. It was extra thick and creamy, and clearly homemade. I enjoyed a hearty spoonful, and mere moments after it was finished the fish and fries appeared. The four huge family-style platters took up any remaining real estate on the table. Since I was at the head I had first dibs on the fish and took a modest 5 pieces. A hefty handful of the crinkle cut fries followed them onto my plate as did a generous dollop of the Esquires homemade tartar. I stared in, and am not sure I said another word until a refill was requested. I was in the zone. I plowed through my first helping of perch as the light and flaky fish went down easy. It had just the subtlest hint of fish taste, but was adequately balanced by the well-seasoned, crumbly breading. When the second round of fish made an appearance I scored another couple of pieces, and finished my evening with one more as one plate number three. All rounds of fish were served phenomenally hot and tasted equally good. When it comes to AYCE Fish Fry, consistency counts, and the Squire has it in spades. Since this is an AYCE affair you pretty much have to expect the standard crinkle cut fries, and that is exactly what you get. At the very least they were nice and hot and I would say just slightly above average. Whereas we splurged on three rounds of fish, the crinkles were limited to two and the second round was fried just a bit too long. Surprisingly, the two large cups of zesty tartar lasted all the way to the end, probably because the rich and creamy sauce can easily overpower the fish if overused. I think it would be fair to say that everyone at our table got their $10.75 worth, and while I liked this Fish Fry a little bit more when it was only nine bucks I really cant complain too much. Everything was still fantastic (some slow service aside) and still a good deal at $10.75. Overall this Fish Fry is highly recommendable and remains one of the best in the Madison area. www.esquireclubmadison.com1025 N.

That being said, we have also had a lot of people write in and tell us how great their experience at the Club was and that without us they never would have given it a shot. Like most people every time we have been there the food has been great and the service has been extremely fast and friendly. We had a friend, and former Madison resident, coming to town and it turned out she had never been to there. Since it was getting late and the Esquire was close I figured it would be a good bet yet again. I was right.We arrived at 8:30 and were told we would have to wait for 30 minuets or so, not bad I thought. We found some open spots around the bar and ordered a round of drinks. As the Old Fashioneds and beers were poured I looked around and noticed several upgrades to the décor which were nice and didnt detract from the Supper Club atmosphere at all. However, the multitude of Iowa Hawkeye fans roaming around the restaurant may have. There was way too much black and yellow present and no where near enough red and white for my taste. Even with all these out-of-towners present no more than 15 minutes passed before our name was called and we headed to the dining room.Our front-row-center table was awaiting our arrival and was stocked with some Supper Club staples including a queen-sized bowl with a king-sized portion of tartar. The sauce dangled over the edge and hung in mid air, precariously clinging only to its thick and creamy self. Our waitress was on us in an instant and grabbed our orders, two AYCE, one bacon wrapped tenderloin and one veggie pasta. As we waited we enjoyed some of the creamy, zesty coleslaw and a piece of room temperature pre-sliced French bread. The bread wasnt all that great but she did say we could have rye with the Fish Fry if we wanted. The ocean perch came about 15 minutes later and fresh from the fryer.The OP, as always, was just great. While the fish itself is a little fishy tasting it is combined with a deliciously light and crumbly batter. When this mixture meets the near perfect tartar sauce a euphoric taste experience is achieved. For $10.25 you really arent going to find a much better value than this. And since it is AYCE if for one reason or another you do get a sub-par piece of fish you can simply pass it over and grab another. Although I have to say, of all the times I have been there I can barley remember any sub-par pieces, the Esquire is consistently that good.The crinkle cut fries that accompanied could have been hotter on the first round but were still very good overall. The second round that came were scalding but really not that much better. You cant get too excited about them, but they are pretty much what you should expect when AYCE is involved. Overall this was another resounding success at the Esquire. The food was great, and the service was fast and friendly. When it comes right down to it the Esquire is offering a great AYCE Fish Fry at a great price. Sure, maybe ocean perch isnt the most traditional fish but I sure dont see a whole lot of places offering AYCE lake perch or bluegill and I have to imagine they would go broke pretty damn quick if they tried. As it stands the Esquire is easily a top 5 Madison area Fish Fry and a real deal especially if you are packing a BIG appetite. www.esquireclubmadison.com1025 N.

He wanted nothing but the best on his special day, so we headed to the Esquire Club. This may be the only time we have been to the Esquire and the place was not packed. We were able to get five seats in a row at the bar which is pretty amazing and we only had to wait about 20 minutes for a table.

We had one person order the fried Cod, two that ordered Lake Perch, and four that went for the AYCE.The Ocean Perch, as always, was plentiful and delicious. Served so hot it is almost unbelievable. I think at least one person burned their mouth. The French fries were also spot on, crinkle cut and hot as can be. The tartar was plentiful as was the rye bread and coleslaw. There was also a whole tub of lemons at the table but Im not sure I saw anyone actually grab one. I managed to sneak a piece of the cod as well; it was good but not as good as the Ocean Perch. It has a much softer, flaky texture which is more suited to a fork, while the OP comes in smaller pieces which are crisped up a little and should only be eaten with ones hands. Although there was some Lake Perch floating around the table I was unable to procure a piece but Im not sure I could have even eaten one. Overall I think Gabe had a great birthday dinner and everyone was sure to comment on how good their respective Fish Fry was.

Since the Esquire Club is only a short drive from the airport it made perfect sense since my flight didn’t get in until 8:30 or so. I was hungry and thought 9:00 might be a little late and I might not get any fish again this Friday. I was pleased to find out that on Friday night the Esquire Club serves until 11:00. Isn’t it just wonderful that you can get some of the best Fish Fry in town that late at night? When we got there we were seated pretty much immediately. The huge bowl of delicious tartar was awaiting our arrival, along with the large loaf of rye bread and the very cabbage-y (and kinda nasty) coleslaw. We both went for the AYCE eat Ocean Perch and it was on the table within 5 minutes or so. Our waitress brought the Fish and the Fries out on one plate, truly a family style affair. The Fish was hot and delicious, as it always it. Ocean Perch does taste a little more ‘fishy’ than cod but the batter the Esquire uses only enhances this flavor. The fries were hot and crispy and just about what you would/should expect at a Fish Fry. After going through the first plate fairly easily my girlfriend I ordered ‘a couple more pieces’. Of course our waitress brings out another full plate of fish and fries, way more than we are prepared to eat at this point. The second plate could not have been hotter if they would have brought the fryer directly to our table. Truly amazing. We do our best but only get about half way through the second plate and call it quits. The service is always good at the Esquire. I assume this is partially because almost everyone is ordering the Fish Fry and the kitchen is just hummin’. The fish is fantastic and there are always a lot of people hanging out in the bar and chatting over drinks after a good meal. The Esquire has the essence of a great Supper Club.

The Esquire Club tonight was no exception - we were lucky to get a parking spot on the street, more or less in the lot. However, the irresistible smell of Fish Fry was in the air and it coaxed us into the Club.When we got inside we were told the wait would be about an hour (this was at 8 pm mind you). Knowing that the fish was well worth the wait I assured my companions the time would fly by. A large mug of Spotted Cow, and about 40 minutes later our name was called and we headed to our table. The time was at hand. Our waitress, Brittni, was at the table almost instantly. She dropped off some menus and went to get us another round of drinks. For me there was no real reason to look at the menu, the only real option is the AYCE Ocean Perch. My girlfriend took a quick look but also quickly decided that the special was the way to go as did everyone else with us. When she returned with our drinks it was simple a matter of my friend blurting out ‘OP all around’ for our orders to be placed. I think we can safely say Brittni has worked a few of the Esquire Club’s Fish Fries, and she has it down pat. For those who have never been to the Esquire, the special is served family style and comes out of the kitchen so hot it is almost unfathomable. I, of course, grab a piece, instantly chomp into it, and practically burn my face off - a true thing of beauty. The Ocean Perch is slightly fishy tasting but cooked so well that it only enhances the flavor. Once you get a taste for it, you just want more and more, and since there is no danger of running low you can sit back and really enjoy putting down piece after delicious piece.The fries are served on a big plate, just like the fish and just as hot too. Crinkle cut and delicious, exactly what you should expect. The tartar sauce was also practically perfect; served family style as well, our dish was almost bone dry by the time our group of 4 finished our second plate of fish. Even the coleslaw at the Esquire is top notch which is waiting at the table for your party along with a large sliced roll of rye bread. Truly what a great Fish Fry is all about.The Esquire is certainly a Classic Fish Fry. It would have been worth waiting the full hour, but we got seated in less than 40 minutes, which during this time of year is not bad at all. The service was stellar and of course the food was some of the best you are going to find. This may truly be the best Fish Fry in Madison, and that is saying something.www.esquireclubmadison.com1025 N.

I should know. Even a couple pieces of greasy goodness can go a long way to easing the unpleasantness. Thankfully for us, St. Pattys 2011 fell on a Thursday, making a follow-up Fish Fry on Friday a reality. We rolled into OGradys near noon, still emanating vapors from our previous evenings excursions. We were seated in a dimly lit corner which served as a welcome escape from the cloudless sky outside. On Friday nights OGradys does a full-fledged AYCE Fish Fry, but the lunch offering is limited to their more economical 2-piece fish n chips, leaving us no choice. It took a while to get our grub thanks to our less than expedient waiter, but everything was nice and hot when it arrived. I started with the fish which instantly put my stomach at ease. The cod played host to a standard beer batter which was good, but not great. The creamy coating was semi-thick, and housed a moderate amount of grease. The grease was soothing on this day, and didnt overpower the fish itself which was also basic, but acceptable. Making the mildly greasy cod go down easy was OGradys homemade tartar sauce. While a bit of dill was visible in the thick sauce, its taste was negligible. Any remaining tartar that wasnt used on the two average sized pieces of cod was eagerly scooped up by the straight-cut, skin-on, French fries. While they werent cut in-house and were slightly under-fried, they got the job done. As per usual with fish n chips dinners, no bread accompanied the meal which is to be expected, but is no less disappointing. Some homemade slaw did make the grade, and treated my tummy fine, but would have benefited from some added zing. I could take it or leave it, but in this case I took it due to the fact that the amount of fish and fries werent exactly gigantic and my gut needed all it could get.Overall, this was a fine Fish Fry, but Im not sure Ill be back to OGradys for lunch on a Friday. While their AYCE dinner is really a good deal, and won us over previously, the fish n chips lunch just didnt quite do it. Everything was basically just acceptable, and while it did improve my condition, it was more a case of the greasiness, and not the deliciousness. martinogradys.com/7436 Mineral Point RoadMadison, WI 53717     (608) 833-4262",2354,0.10150424510889629,0.42044112218530827

Good soup = good food, blah soup = blah food. Recently I had lunch at OGradys Irish Pub with my folks and in the process tried a cup of their chili. It was really good, as were the entrees that everyone got, so the old adage seemed to hold. I have known about OGradys Fish Fry for a long time, but after having a good regular meal there I knew I had to finally give it shot. I also knew based on our previous endeavor that they have good vegetarian options, and since my little veggie was along for the ride it seemed like the perfect fit. With Jer in tow, we headed west.We arrived at the Mineral Point Road mainstay around 7:30 and were immediately ushered to one of the many available tables. The $10.25 beer battered cod special was on the board and to my delight it was listed as AYCE. The waitress came by a couple minutes after we sat down and took our drink orders  one Spotted Cow, one $2.00 Amaretto Sour (on special) and one Makers Mark (for Jer, who was drinking his dinner this evening). The waitress was a little taken aback by his order and we were not exactly sure if his Makers, neat would come as expected. When it came, it was definitely neat, and a generous neat at that this double was more like a quadruple as it was at least 5 ounces of straight booze. Well done barkeep, we all thought; starting the evening off right. At this point I also gave the waitress my fish order.Prior to the fish I was treated to a lovely cup of clam chowder in lieu of coleslaw. The chowder was rich and creamy and tasted superb, as did the slice of fresh bread that accompanied it. After a quick taste, Jer also grabbed a cup to enjoy with his bourbon: mmm mmm mmm, clam chowder and Makers Mark - its a winning combination! The cod arrived about 5 minutes after I polished off my soup and was fresh from the fryer. The beer batter was actually really good as it wasnt terribly thick, but wasnt thin either. It had a good creamy flavor, which was not over the top. The fish itself was flaky, but the taste was pretty much dominated by the beer batter. After polishing off my first two pieces I asked for another round which was even hotter and tastier than the first, although I did have some lag time in between.My French fries were also right on the money. The straight-cut, skin-on potatoes looked homemade and were perfectly fried. Like the fish, they were ungodly hot when served and came in good quantity, although unlike the cod, they were not AYCE which begs a question I have asked before: why would you offer AYCE fish, but not fries? I would think fries are cheaper and you would want people to fill up on them if possible. I may never figure that one out... A very tasty tartar comes in the Fish Fry mix as well. It really improved the taste of the rich cod, but unlike the fries, more comes along with your second (and possibly third) helpings of fish. To top it all off, the service was pretty good, although it seemed like our waitress was a little clueless (at least when it came to booze, she knew the menu forward and back however). Overall, I can easily recommend this Fish Fry for several reasons - one: the fish is good (and AYCE), two: the tasty fries and tartar are homemade, and three: the chowder was great and served with fresh baked bread. All that easily adds up to a recommendable Fry, especially when you take into account you get it all for only $10.25 which is a pretty square deal. The place itself is also much nicer than you might expect, considering it is in a mini-mall. When all is said and done the old soup maxim seems to have held. The food was great and the booze was cheap ($6.25 for all that bourbon), which is enough to keep us coming back. And hey, any time we need to give Jer a ride home from a Fish fry, we will chalk it up as a win.martinogradys.com/7436 Mineral Point RoadMadison, WI 53717     (608) 833-4262",3962,0.24810432205010516,0.5055500389837742

Their carry-out only philosophy is basically the same concept as drive-thru fast food, but since the food is in a whole different stratosphere it makes great fish-n-chips incredibly convenient for people in the neighborhood. Unfortunately, for those of us who dont live close to the Whitney Way or Old Sauk edifices, the allure is just not the same.We visited the Old Sauk Seafood Center back in April, 2010, and were less than impressed. It was a bit of a letdown because we had heard so many glowing reviews of their fish, so I figured maybe it was just the new location and the original would do them justice. Unfortunately, we were basically met with more of the same. We got our fish within 5 minutes of ordering, took it outside, and swiped a couple spots in front of the deserted coffee shop on the corner (SC doesnt have any indoor or outdoor seating of its own). The cod will run seven bucks and swims in a school of three. The fish was actually good, but the pieces were not exactly plump as I have heard them described. They were your traditional cuts and coated in a traditional light breading which was fairly firm, but still flaky. The golden-brown glaze was well-fried, but could have used a little more gusto, in our opinion. Tagging along behind the school was a horde of straight-cut, skin on French fries. This tasty troop played their part, but much like our last visit the spuds were a little colder than the fish. Neither the fish nor the fries got any support from the tartar as relish-heavy the Kraft brand just wasnt up to snuff. Unfortunately, the SC has about a dozen other tartar options for sale, but apparently they think the grocery store mainstay is pretty good so none of the others are offered. Well just have to agree to disagree. Finishing off the fish-n-chip was a side of creamy coleslaw. It was your basic traditional Sysco-style mix, but played its part admirably. Of course, no bread comes with fish-n-chips, so The SC is clearly a great place for fresh fish. The variety is impressive, and things like the live lobster tank, and smoked salmon are fantastic. The service is always fast, the people behind counter are very friendly, and they seem to do a good job giving suggestions to those who asked for them. Overall, we just cant quite recommend their fish-n-chips even if the fish and chips themselves are good. No bread and a commercial tartar just dont do it for us, but if we ever decide to try our own hand at frying fish, we will definitely get the goods from the SC. Unfortunately, I think this is probably the last time we let them do the frying on our behalf. http://www.seafoodcentermadison.com/712 South Whitney WayMadison, WI(608) 274-5255",2771,0.15549873737373734,0.5141666666666667

Will we ever learn? Weve been lured to your doors by the promise of Bass Ale Beer Battered Cod before, only to walk away disappointed. Did we learn nothing from that experience, or do we just want to give you the benefit of the doubt? It was 2007 after all, and that was a long time ago, things could have changed for the better, right? We hoped they had.Even though plenty of time has passed, things at the Village Green have pretty much stayed the same (at least as far as the Friday Fish Fry is concerned). The fish is still pre-battered, the fries are still from a big brown bag, and the sides just kinda sit there. To be fair our $10 Friday special came quickly, especially when you consider how many burger orders were in line before it... Thats about where the praise ends. The number one no-no at a Fish Fry is pre-battered fish. It just isnt the same as the freshly hand-dipped stuff and has a distinctly processed taste. The Green trots out three pieces of the freezer fish, and even though they claim it to be Bass Ale Beer Battered, it must come from the distributor that way since they clearly arent doing it in-house. Its just like the cod you get at the Glass Nickel (which is a pizza place for god sakes). For being frozen its somewhat decent, but it just cant compete with the fresh stuff you get almost everywhere else on Fridays. Crispy? Yes. Tasty? Sorta. Satisfying? Far from it. The thick, Julienne-cut fries were poured from a brown bag, and not even all that well-fried. Like the fish, they werent the worst thing weve ever eaten, but certainly arent going to wow anyone. The best thing on the plate may have been the tartar, which was thick and creamy, and mercifully masked the weak fish when liberally applied. Thanks be to Sysco for the respite. An additional Solo cup was filled to the brim with some creamy coleslaw, but it didnt have any zip, and had a distinct apple aftertaste which was mildly off-putting. The fact that no bread comes with the Fish Fry is also off-putting, and the two hushpuppies they plop on the side far from make up for it. The crusty balls were oniony (good thing), but also dry and hollow (bad thing). No thanks. The Village Green is one of those places we really want to like, but their Fish Fry just doesnt cut it. Perhaps if this was Madison Burger Review theyd receive the glowing marks we want to bestow upon them (burgers are clearly their specialty), but as far as the fish goes youre looking at Cs and Ds. Overall, we dont recommend the Fish Fry at the Village Green and definitely wont come back for it a third time Although the Big Daddy might get us back in the door someday.

Its the self-proclaimed troll capitol of the world. The main street is referred to as the Trollway. Theres troll-related paraphernalia all over town. Troll this, and troll that. Here at MFF were not really into trolls (although a Troll Fry does sound intriguing). Were more into fish so when we found ourselves in Mount Horeb on a Friday there was only one bridge we wanted to cross. The Grumpy Troll offers cod and lake perch on Fridays and since its a brew pub both come beer battered. Since beer battering freshwater fish is a no-no in our book we went with the cod and a side of waffle fries. As expected, the four thin pieces of cod were cloaked in a thick batter that basically drowned the fish. Mercifully, the batter tasted good and was surprisingly grease-free so all was not lost. Plenty of waffle fries partnered with the cod and were well-seasoned and crunchy. They added some much needed spunk and seemed to be a sage choice. There are a lot of other potato options as well so if waffles fries arent your thing fear not, the Troll has you covered. When thick beer batter is the name of the game a thick and creamy tartar is a prerequisite, and the Grumpys sauce complies. It was a big, bold blend that quelled the fish to some extent and made it more enjoyable overall. Some sassy slaw also did its part with a pleasant pop and smooth finish.Trolls are a little different in general, so its not totally unexpected that the Fish Fry at the Grumpy Troll  would come with a twist. Luckily, this twist was a subtle and very welcomed one. A nice, little pretzel roll came in the place of a boring dinner roll and was soft and fresh. It was unique, but not off the wall and gave this Fish Fry an added dimension. The Grumpy Troll is easily the most well-known dining spot in Mont Horeb and we can see why. The place itself is pretty nice, they have gimmick that clearly works, and they brew their own beer (which a lot of people really seem to enjoy). All that adds up to a winner, but even winners dont always ace the Fish Fry test. The fish was okay in every sense of the word, but were honestly not sure wed make the drive to get it again. Overall, we barely recommend this Fish Fry and would probably come back if we lived closer, but since we dont we might leave this one to the trolls. www.thegrumpytroll.com105 S. Second StreetMt.

Well, I guess the salad bar was okay so it wasnt a TOTAL bust, but it was still a pretty big bust. For 15 bucks the Red Mouse will give you a ½ pound of bluegill. Sounds like a good deal, right? Wrong. The fillets are incredibly tiny and coated in a thick, peppery breading that just does not taste good. Since the fish is so scant the only taste you get is the overly-crispy, dark breading which was basically used to mask what appears to be low quality fish. No one in our party of frequent Fish Fryers came close to eating their whole portion, which speaks volumes. The cod eaters fare better, but even it is just okay, and greasy, very, very greasy.The hash browns with cheese and onion are abundant, and abundantly greasy as well. These shreds would be at home in the greasiest of greasy spoons, but are actually really good, although you know they are just awful for you. They are each capped with an absolute mass of melted cheese on top ensuring these greasebombs could cure the stingiest of hangovers.The usable tartar sauce will improve the fish, but then again, just about anything would. This blend has more than just relish in it so it will be kind of unique, if nothing else. The only saving grace to this meal is the full salad that lives in the main-bar-adjacent banquet hall (well, that and the mini-corndog appetizer). Everything on the bar will be surprisingly fresh, including the two bags of rolls  one white and one pumpernickel. Both styles of bread will be dense, but not stale since they are likely purchased the morning of. The salad will be your standard iceberg-based mix but will be well supplemented with cottage cheese, snotty looking (but tasty) coleslaw and a bunch of other typical salad bar stuff (no pickled herring though).If you are expecting crackerjack service you wont find it at the Mouse. Our friend Jen (who works Cahoots Fish Fry from time to time) actually took our orders and dropped them by the bar, although a waitress did deliver it, so I guess theres that. It is expected the check will also be paid at the bar so any follow-up inquiries into the quality of the food will fall by the wayside.

I know the JJ of JJ's La Puerta personally. JJ grew up in my hometown and was friends with my old man. In fact JJ was ""Cecil's"" Best Man, and maybe vice versa (I'm not sure on that part). They were thick as thieves those two and ""the stories we could tell..."" JJ's son Jesse and I have also been friends for as long as I can remember and we'd hang out every Christmas when they'd come visit Jesse's grandpa in old VTown. So, there may be some inherent bias here, but I'm going to try to stay impartial...JJ's La Puerta is a known commodity in Sister Bay, and while I was longing for their lake perch, it's only served after 5pm so I settled on the Fish & Chips. It's the only real lunch ""Fish Fry"" option, and only costs $10 so it's a bit more fitting than the $17 dinner anyway. The fish in the basket is haddock and served what I'd call ""finger"" style. The four long appendages are light and flaky with a breading to match. This is the kind of fish that's easy to crush, literally two bites per for a big mouth like me, and while I'd take another hit of salt in the breading it was gone in an instant either way. Reviews of JJ's on-line are mixed with some decrying the overly expansive menu that features not only classic American grub but also Mexican fare. I'm assuming those dissenters don't know (or don't care to know) that JJ's and La Puerta used to be two separate restaurants with their own unique menus that were made one by removing a wall between them and combining the menus - they always shared the kitchen as far as I know. However, one thing no one can complain about are the man's house-cut fries. JJ was doing fries right long before frites were in vogue, back when everyone thought McDonald's fries were as good as it got. These spuds are superb and it shows, from the color to the texture, the man is a master. There's nothing fancy or funky about the tartar or the slaw that comes with this fish and that's just fine with me. They do their job without asking for anything in return and that works. Of course, since it's a Fish & Chips affair and not a full fledged Fish Fry no bread comes along, but I got my fill of complimentary chips and salsa before so there's no love lost. Of course, had I been willing to flag JJ down I'm sure he would have grabbed me a roll or something, but that's not the way I roll...pun 100% intended. JJ is a master restaurateur and a simple Fish & Chips is easy as it comes for a team like his. As they say the apple doesn't fall far from the tree and his son Jesse has one of, if not the absolute best places to eat in all of Door County - the Door County Creamery. Believe me when I tell you, no visit to the peninsula is complete without stopping for some fresh goat cheese, his specialty sandwiches, or house-made gelato. As far as the Fish & Chips at JJ's goes, we recommend it and don't think it's all that biased to do so. www.jjslapuerta.com10961 North Bay Shore DriveSister Bay, WI 54234     (920) 854-4513",3063,0.1975033068783069,0.5705109126984126

The JJ of JJs is a family friend. He knew MFF before MFF could even comprehend what it was to know someone. It would be easy for me to be partial to JJs Fish Fry, but Ill do my best to be unbiased. And, to be honest, this is a very respectable Fish Fryalthough on the high side price-wise (but its Door County so everything is expensive, you gotta know that going in).It was Memorial Day and even though Id had a Fry the prior Friday it just sounded right this Monday. I paid homage to our fallen soldiers with my thoughts, and homage to all the fallen Frys with my dinner. JJs perch is on the everyday menu, but its Door County so thats not entirely unexpected. While the price is lofty ($18), it is a HUGE plate (in fact its two full plates), and its the genuine article so you can either like it or leave it. I like itThe seven fillets fill out the portion and are light and sweet. The breading is there to give you something to hold onto but doesnt need to steal the show. It does exactly what its supposed to do - which is let the fish star, and star it does. This is how perch should be done  a little crispy, a little tender, but enough texture to let you know it wasnt caught two months ago. If you know anything about me its that Im a sucker for house-cut fries and JJ has them. JJ doesnt know the meaning of a freezer fry and this huge portion is perfectly fried. Before frites were all the rage JJs had spuds licked. While JJs tartar is on the thin side it has all the flavor you need, and since the perch was so good it didnt really need it anyway. A bit of basic slaw, a couple slices of garlic toast, and some slices of pineapple and watermelon finish things off with a welcome twist. All in all, its a big meal and embodies DoCo in the best of ways. While it would be easy for me to just say this is the best Fish Fry ever, I cant go quite that far. However, theres no doubt that this is a great Fish Fry that epitomizes all Door County has to offer.

While JJs lake perch is reserved for dinner time there is an $8.00 fish-n-chips available all day every day so if you want lunch there is an option. You might expect an everyday fish-n-chips to be a pre-breaded slapdash effort but JJs is anything but. The cod is cut into small chunks and hand-breaded in a light, well-seasoned coating. Seven or so small pieces come in the basket and total about 10 ounces or so. JJ doesnt know the meaning of freezer fries and all the taters in his place are cut in-house. These are super spuds and fried just right by JJs revolving cast of seasonal workers. The thick and creamy tartar that comes along is also topnotch and appeared to be more than just the standard Sysco stuff. Usually fish-n-chips means no sides, and while the bread was absent a nice cup of slaw was perched atop the plethora of fried goodies. It was a peppy rendition and the creamy blend added just enough to make this a little more than just the basics. JJs has been a DC institution forever and while it might not be everyones cup of tea it strikes the right chord with 95% of people looking to have a good time with some good grub in good old Door County.

Bill’s is a very nice place and I figured my review might have been a little short sighted at the time. I didn’t fully remember what it was like and wanted to refresh my memory. We arrived at Captain Bill’s early since we were eating with some friends that had small children who needed to be in bed before 8:00. The Capitol Amber Fish Fry at Captain Bill’s costs $12.00 and is not a Friday special. The other two fish options were Lake Perch ($19.00!) and Walleye ($20.00!) which were also on the everyday menu. The cod had a decent flavor but was overcooked and very firm. The beer battered did very little for me and out of my three pieces, two were scalding hot and one was lukewarm. The other people who got the Fish Fry were also not impressed and had even worse percentages of hot to lukewarm fish. Every piece should be scalding and getting 2/3 lukewarm pieces is just unacceptable.The French fries were very good however. They were straight cut potatoes with a spicy, waffle fry style seasoning, which was delicious. They could also have been hotter but were still very good. The tartar sauce was just fine although a small portion had me scraping the bottom of the cup at the end. The bread served was a rosemary ciabatta which was good and served with three unique homemade butters. The coleslaw was also tasty, especially for slaw. One of the little ones with us actually took her mom’s coleslaw and downed the whole thing after clearly stating that she did not like coleslaw.The service at captain Bill’s was very good as was the atmosphere. Everyone working there was very friendly and had no problems with a larger party. Overall I just can’t recommend this Fish Fry. The service was great, the fries were commendable and the rest of the non-fish items were perfectly acceptable. However, when you have Fish Fry, the most important element is the fish and after having it twice I can honestly say that there are many better places out there.www.capbills.com/2701 Century Harbor Rd.Middleton, WI 53562     (608) 831-7327",2145,0.23637008582502766,0.6018936877076411

We have done Quivey’s Grove (Jonny Bluegill) and The Avenue Bar (Hull) in the past so precedence has been set. We needed to represent in a big way for Bitz and when I heard the Stamm House recommended I quickly seconded it. The Stamm House always puts out a great All You Can Eat Fish Fry and I had a feeling that they would actually take a reservation for our party of 17 (and they did). We made the reservation and told everyone to be there at 7pm. We arrived a little early with the Bachelor and got a couple drinks at the bar. The bartender knew something was up and joined right in as we poked and prodded Bitz from every angle (his weekend was just beginning). By 7:15 or so everyone had trickled in and we were led our massive table upstairs. Our waitress quickly noticed that this was no ordinary group of 17 but was relieved to hear that everyone was getting the Fish Fry which would make her life a lot easier. She grabbed some more drinks for those in need and brought out slaw and bread (no chowder option for a group this size it seems). The slaw was just fine, but unpopular overall and the bread loafs were good but not quite as warm as they usually are. Within 15 minutes the first round of fish, tartar and fries hit the table only to disappear onto individual plates within seconds. I made sure to grab two generous sized filets and a handful of fries. The tartar was also drained instantly and a refill requested. The fish was fantastically hot and tasted damn near perfect when combined with the tarter and a swig of Spotted Cow. I put the first two pieces down, along with slightly above average crinkle cut fries and waited for round two.Our waitress knew this crew was here to eat so she just kept the fish coming at a plateful every 4-5 minutes for a good 20 minutes or so. I eventually wound up on my 6-7th piece and reached satiety but not before truly having All I Could Eat. Every piece was fresh from the fryer and hot as can be. The Ocean Perch flavor is fantastic when mixed with their homemade batter. There were a couple minutes where we did have to wait on a tartar or French fry refill but even they were short lived and everyone wound up getting plenty of hot, delicious Fish Fry.Normally eating with a group this size can be difficult but the Stamm House handled it with ease. Our waitress did a great job and controlled the crowd with her only weapons, fish and booze. As soon as the perch was gone there was more on the way, aside from a couple minor delays everyone had what they wanted all the time. Drinks came quickly and fish flowed freely. Overall I would have to say that the Stamm House met and exceeded my expectations this trip. All members of the bachelor party were happy and had a good base with which to work with for the remainder of the evening. If you are looking for a consistently great Fish Fry, the Stamm House never seems to disappoint. www.stammhouserestaurant.com/6625 Century AvenueMiddleton, WI 53562     (608) 831-5835",3092,0.21365440115440112,0.532972582972583

There are so many great films from different genres that you can’t really even compare them. Which is better, The Godfather or Gone with the Wind? Casablanca or Citizen Kane? They are all so good it is nearly impossible to say which best. It is much the same as it is with Friday Night Fish Fry. While we currently have the Esquire Club listed at #1 it is literally fractions of a point from the #10 ranked Stamm House.  We had actually planned to go to Morel’s but when we got there noticed that they were no longer open (here is an idea, get rid of your website or at least post a huge CLOSED sign on the home page). We did a quick 180 and headed back towards Pheasant Branch and the Stamm House. On Friday nights the Stamm House has a well known (and loved) Fish Fry so I knew we would be in good hands. We arrived about 7:30 and got the last open table in the dining room. Our bleach blond waitress was at the table soon after and immediately asked if we were both getting fish. Since both of us were not we requested some drinks and she scurried off to get them. She was back shortly after and took our orders.Of course I went with the AYCE Ocean Perch and it was ready in about 15 minutes. Since I was the only AYCE I got my own plate of fish, fries and huge bowl of tartar. The OP was great as it always is. The fish was fried just right and a perfect match with the spot on tartar. This first serving could have been a little hotter but it was still fine. I assume it waited for a few minutes while our other entrée was prepared. I plowed the first three pieces down with the handful of crinkle cut fries and requested my second. The second order was scalding hot and equally delicious. After 6 pieces of fish and two plates of fries I was one happy camper.Before the main course we were treated to a soup/salad/slaw option. I went for the seafood chowder which was very good and a nice precursor to the “fishy” tasting fish that came after. The little basket of warm rolls (pumpernickel, onion and plain) paired well with the chowder.I think we got a little lucky on this trip. We were seated immediately, although the next group behind us had a 20 minute wait. A huge party with 24 people showed up, but just as we were leaving. We were in and out in less than 1 hour, if we had been 10-20 minutes later we would have been in for a long wait and potentially slow service. Whether we lucked out or not this was still an awesome Fish Fry. The AYCE OP is clearly phenomenal and the fact that it is All You Can Eat garners some extra love. The fries and tartar are perfect compliments to the fish and the starters are excellent. Overall this is clearly one of the best Fish Fries in Madison and one you can hit up any Friday without worry. As far as the greatest movies of all time go, anything in the top 25 is really a can’t miss. The same goes for Fish Fry; if I highly recommend it there is a chance that it could be the best. When you get to the top it is usually about personal preference and some may say the Stamm House is the best, you won’t get a lot of argument from me. www.stammhouserestaurant.com/6625 Century AvenueMiddleton, WI 53562     (608) 831-5835",3323,0.2958646874387616,0.4898363707622965

The Friday Night Fish Fry consists of All You Can Eat Ocean Perch which is lightly breaded yet fairly firm and crispy. The fish taste does come through a little bit but is well complimented by the almost perfect tartar sauce. The perch, tartar sauce and the French fries are served family style so there is no fear of running out. The French fries are crinkle cut and usually very good, although this time they were just alright. The bread selection was nice, one plain roll, one poppyseed roll and on pumpernickel-rye style roll. I got the seafood chowder which is very good as a substitute for the coleslaw. Possibly the best part was that even though the bar was packed we got seated immediatly and were able to get in and out in less the 45 minutes. Great fish from great restaurant served lightning quick, you can't really ask for much more than that. www.stammhouserestaurant.com/6625 Century AvenueMiddleton, WI 53562     (608) 831-5835",1097,0.3743700396825396,0.5401818783068782

Maybe its the unique location? JJs is the only building on that stretch of 113 and is entirely surrounded by trees and marsh making it stick out like a sore thumb. Or, maybe it is no nonsense, semi-soiled-but-we-dont-give-a-crap ambiance of the place? Then again, perhaps its the unique moniker that is as intriguing as it is off-putting at the same time? Whatever the case may be, JJs is an interesting place and features pretty darn good Fish Fry.Rolling solo I pulled into JJs rather expansive lot just before noon and took a stool on the far side of the bar. The bartender came over a few seconds later, grabbed me a beer, and took my order. For lunch the TOTS features a 2-piece cod for eight clams which come complete with a soup or salad option. The cup of clam chowder I chose came out almost instantly and looked homemade. It featured big asymmetrical chunks of potato, to go with a modest amount of calm. The few bites of clam I did get were awesome though, as at least three or four had that faint sandy crunch at the end. I love that.As I was polishing off the last bits of the chowder the steaming hot fish arrived. The cod was difficult to handle due to the extreme heat, but I managed as best I could. Each of the two chunks were large and meaty, and kind of tasted like they had been soaked in butter before frying. While the fish was marginally flaky, it was on the verge of going mushy from accumulating grease. To keep it from settling and soggifying too much I repeatedly turned it, but even that level of diligence was not enough. By the end, the light and spicy batter was totally separated from its host making the last few bites strictly a fork-only affair. A heap of battered French fries teamed with the cod forming a dynamic duo. The Julienned potatoes were well fried and gave the necessary respite from the creamy cod. JJs tartar was also right on the money, and the thick, creamy, sauce gave the cod a real kick in the tail. It also helped to quell the greasier portions of the fish, making every last bit edible.The next car on our Fish Fry train was a single slice of French bread which was home to an extremely tough crust that practically had to be sawn through. While it was nice to have on the trip with us it wasnt exactly first class. The slaw car picked up some of the slack however, and the classic zesty blend helped keep this Fish Fry on track. This was our second trip to the Top of the Swamp and it pretty much mirrored our first experience. The friendly folks, decent fish, and standard sides all stacked up to make for a good meal at a fair price. In addition, JJs does have seating beyond the bar and the three or four tables that flank it. During the dinner hours plenty of more space is made available in their surprisingly large dining room which is closed off for lunch. Overall, we feel comfortable recommending the Fish Fry at JJs, and feel like we will be back to frolic in this Swamp again before too long. 5344 State Road 113Madison, WI 53704     (608) 249-0505",3083,0.16027777777777777,0.4856462585034013

Theyve been at their spot on Old Middleton Road for what seems like forever and have no trouble packing them in each and every Friday (and Wednesday for that matter). The bar knows their clientele as well as any and stick to their tried and true recipe for success. They definitely have it down and run an impressive amount of people through the miniscule bar without batting an eyelash. Its really a sight to see.Of course when we showed up this Friday the bar was packed. Fortunately, the ever-diligent bartenders keep a watchful eye on the crowd and we had beer in our hands in no time. Eventually we got some seats at the bar and decided to just order there rather than wait for a table to open up. The fish of choice at the crest is the lake perch (although cod is available for those leery of the freshwater finsters). The perch isnt cheap (at $14.00), but the five filets are large and will fill you up. In addition there is a Hungry Man portion for a whopping $22 or you can add additional pieces to the regular portion for $2.50 a pop. The perch is certainly high quality and flaky which is always a good place to start. With a base like that all you really need is a light breading with some seasoning and youre home free. Unfortunately, the homemade batter at the Oakcrest could use some work. While its not a total teardown and rebuild situation, its relatively rigid and basically just beer and flour. It doesnt have any discernable seasoning and therefor no real taste to speak of. All you get is the taste of the fish, and while thats okay, some more salt would surely perk it up. The crinkle-cut fries that come with the fish are the simplest fries youll ever find. They wrote the book on basic, and while theyre plain as can be at least theyre fried to a T. Like the batter on the fish, the tartar could use a little life. Its basically straight mayo which makes it seems like theyre not even trying to make a real tartar. It comes in a gigantic cup and while it has plenty of zip, diversity is an afterthought. A little slice of rye comes on the side and does its part and then some. The slaw also picks up some of the slack and might be the best part of the whole meal. While it looks boring it houses a big horseradish punch that makes it deceptively delicious. The Fish Fry Oakcrest is no secret and if you are planning to pay them a visit on Friday night be prepared to wait your turn. Luckily for you the turnover is impressive and waits rarely exceed 30 minutes. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry despite the shortcomings with the batter, and dont see them slowing down any time soon. www.facebook.com/OakcrestTavern?sk=wall5371 Old Middleton RoadMadison, WI 53705     (608) 233-1243",2783,0.1686352657004831,0.49842689918776867

Yes, I had fish. Yes, it was good. But something was off. The perch, while tasty, was HUGE. Far too big to be lake perch (the Oakcrests staple product), but still sold as perch. I guess I should have gotten specific when I ordered, but figured if theyve always had lake perch, theyd have lake perch at 8:00 this Wednesday night. I think I was off. Something was definitely fishy (pun 100% intended).It was Wednesday, it was late, the bar was pretty much empty. Since it was just me I had a front row seat for the fish prep, and thought something was amiss the second I saw him pull out the fish. He picked up the five fat fillets between his fingers and they hung there, each of them a good 6-7 inches long. Now, a big lake perch fillet might get to 4-5 inches (and even that is pushing it) so the ferocious five really had me wondering. Was this lake perch on steroids? Or, more likely, it was this something else like pike-perch, ocean perch, or some other perch? Regardless, Im not really one to ask questions, so I rolled with it figuring if nothing else Id have a new fish to review.Frying fish doesnt take long and I had the plate in about four minutes. The Oakcrest likes to use disposable plates and usually pushes them to their limits. This particular plate was piled even higher than normal thanks mostly to what Im calling the pike-perch. It was an alarming large portion of food that even had the cook saying thats a lot of fish. I put my big boy pants on and got down to business. The purported pike-perch was a worthy adversary and pushed me to the limit, but in the end only one of us remained at the bar. The five fillets, though large, went down easy. The fish was flaky, but didnt have the subtle sweetness of a normal yellow lake perch. It was smooth, but a little blander, and not helped by Oakcrests batter which was a little too dry for the hefty pieces. While I cant say for sure what it was, Im pretty sure it wasnt ocean perch (which is much fishier tasting) or the normal lake perch (which are smaller and sweeter). It was still good regardless of what it was, although I would much prefer their regular lake perch.Forming a study foundation for the perch pile was a serious sh*tload of crinkle cut fries. As far as freezer-to-fryer crinkle cuts go these guys were done right. The tartar was even better, bordering on perfection. The Oakcrest features a thick, creamy, and zesty blend with the perfect mayo:relish proportion. The massive cupful even held up to the ridiculous amount of fish proving once again that this sauce is the boss. The Oackcrests mayo mastery continues into their homemade coleslaw which is only borderline-creamy, but perfectly zesty. When scooped onto the accompanying slice of rye a slaw sandwich of epic proportions is formed, creating taste sensations the likes of which are usually reserved for royalty or the rich and famous. Perhaps they were out of lake perch? Perhaps they cant get it anymore? Regardless, a major component of the Fish Fry is in the actual frying, and that is something the Oakcrest knows how to do. Overall, we still liked this Fish Fry and have no problem recommending it, just not quite as highly as we would their regular lake perch. www.facebook.com/OakcrestTavern?sk=wall5371 Old Middleton RoadMadison, WI 53705     (608) 233-1243",3396,0.13224253296171104,0.5327948839592674

Maybe they were just randomly thinking about Fish Fry as Wisconsinites tend to do? It could well be Regardless, after completing their journey they thought a Fish Fry tour of Madison made a lot of sense and got ahold of us. We agreed to meet them and talk turkey over a plate of perch at the Oakcrest. As expected the Oakcrest was buzzing even though it was a Wednesday. We had a short wait at the bar and no more than five minutes later had a table (which was pretty slick considering wait times often exceed an hour or more on any given Friday). Whats more, we got the big, nice table in the corner with four high stools for only three of us. We felt like royalty, perched on high, above the masses, looking down upon their fish as though it was our own it soon would be. From our roost, we surveyed the scene and wasted no time ordering fish the second our waitress made her appearance. We chewed the fat for about 20 minutes thereafter and before we knew it our platefuls of perch and a cadre of cod came forth. $13 gets you six princely sized perch fillets, a pile of fries, a big ol cup of tartar, a satisfying side of slaw, and some rye. The perch was crispy on the outside and soft and smooth on the inside. It featured a light beer batter which had a nice consistency, but really needed a pick me up in the spice department. Sure, its nice to taste the delicate fish, and it IS tasty, but I want, no, NEED, some spice too! Still, it was better than 90% of the perch out there, all nit-picking aside.If youve had stale, cold, crinkle fries you know how bad they can be (and therefore should know how tasty good ones can be). While the Oakcrest rendition was nothing truly special, the salty spuds were hot, crispy, and generously portioned which is more than enough for us. The tartar was also great, boasting a thick and creamy substrate to go with a nice zip. The larger than average cup was put to good use on both fish and French fry alike. The fish, fries, and tartar are all great, but what really sets the fish at Sweeneys apart is the rye bread and the coleslaw. Rye is rarely seen in this day and age, and while the Oakcrest has scaled their offering back by half, it is still nice they are staying the course to some degree. The subtle sour taste of the rye really enhances the meal and mixes well with the horseradish stank of the coleslaw. Pow! Just right. After talking it over with AtoZ we foresee a Rama Fish Fry App in the not too distant future. Hopefully the endeavor will be fruitful and turn even more people on to the glory of the Wisconsin tradition. As for the Fish Fry at the Oakcrest, not much needs to be said. While it may not make the cut for our Rama App, it is the full meal deal, delicious all around, and highly recommendable whether it be Wednesday or Friday. www.facebook.com/OakcrestTavern?sk=wall5371 Old Middleton RoadMadison, WI 53705     (608) 233-1243",3216,0.16406420279554607,0.501690357735134

I queried the Gabster as to whether he would be interested in jumping the gun and grabbing a mid-week Fish Fry, and wouldnt you know it, he was. We made our way west, eventually landing at the tiny Oakcrest Tavern.The fact that it was Wednesday made no difference and the Oakcrest was every bit as busy as it is on any given Friday. We wedged in as best we could, scored a couple of Cows, and put our name on the waiting list. Another beer or two, and 30 minutes later, Gabe was hailed down and led to the table  smack-dab in the middle of the room. The game was afoot. The waitresses at The Oakcrest arent messing around and ours came over the second we sat down. She knew we were here for fish, so it was basically just a matter of how much we were after. Since the regular portion is more than enough for your average eater we both went that route, although the allegedly mammoth Hungryman was calling my name...The perch came no more than 10 minutes after we ordered and was as hot as can be - The Oakcrest knows the drill. Each of the six large perch fillets featured a light breading, which was not over-flavorful, but housed just enough spice to compliment the delicate taste of the flaky fish underneath. All in all it was splendid, and we devoured every last morsel.Sweeneys knows how to keep the fish flowing, and one way they do it is by not getting bogged down by a bunch of different potato options. The Crest only has two or three choices, but since the crinkle-cut fries are so good they dont really need many more. The spuds virtually surrounded the fish and came in such a large quantity that they even outlasted the substantial portion of perch.While the fish was good enough to stand on its own two fins, the Oakcrests tartar sauce took it to the next level. This sauce was simply superb - heavy on the mayo with a lil relish to keep it interesting. It was just right, and paired perfectly with the pristine perch.Rounding out our Wednesday dinner was a half-slab of rye which was traditional and tasty, but like the edifice it was served in, tiny. It was gone in two chewy mouthfuls, which was unfortunate since it paired so well with the homemade sock-you-in-the-chops coleslaw. The plentiful slaw wasnt messing around and boasted a pungent vinegar blast perfectly offset by a zesty horseradish kick. It was an impressive balancing act and a true display of coleslaw mastery. We finished off the fish, crushed the crinkles, tore through the tartar, ravaged the rye, creamed the coleslaw and then it happened everything went dark seriously the power just went out - *poof* - just like that. Gabe and I, along with probably 40 other patrons, sat there stunned for a moment, waiting for a breaker to flip or something else to restore normalcy. Nothing happened. We sat there some more, the place filling with unvented smoke from the grill, cell phones doubling as flashlights, waiting for our bill and the juice to come back on. Their only recourse to the smoke was to open the doors to the chilly Wisconsin winter which only exacerbated our desire to make a speedy exit. Apparently this isnt the first time the power had gone out at the Oakcrest, but it was all good, and all in attendance took it in good humor. Luckily for us, we had already eaten and had cash-money so we paid quickly and skedaddled. It was an interesting and memorable way to wrap up what was a fantastic Fish Fry, thats for sure. Overall, we highly recommend the Oakcrest (even with the occasional power outage) and will be back to battle their Wednesday/Friday crowd soon enough. www.facebook.com/OakcrestTavern?sk=wall5371 Old Middleton RoadMadison, WI 53705     (608) 233-1243",3797,0.1793238095238095,0.5048711436711436

It had been roughly 6 months since our last visit to Sweeney’s Oakcrest so I lined them up as the “Fry of the Week” and told some friends to come along for the ride.We arranged to meet at 6:00 but since some of the folks on our end were a little late we didn’t arrive until a quarter after. Our friends actually arrived at the packed bar at 6pm sharp and were seated and waiting for us when we got in. The waitress brought us a round of drinks and took our orders. All the Fish Fry-ers opted for the lake perch instead of the cod, some (myself included) went with fries and slaw while a couple others chose different sides. Jer also opted for the “extra fish” for $2.50 but no one was willing to go for the “Hungry Man Perch” which I imagine must be immense since the regular portion is already large. The fish came shortly thereafter and looked marvelous.Just like our last visit the Chinet paper plates were piled high with 5-6 perch filets and a mess of fries. The slaw and a nice slice of rye were lovingly wedged onto the overflowing plates making for an idyllic looking Fish Fry. The perch was delicious as it always is. It was light and flaky with a tasty batter that could use a little more spice, as we noticed last time, but was still great. Even after sitting on the plate for 5-10 minutes the pieces had little to no grease accumulated and still tasted fresh fried. The French fries were very typical crinkle cut jobs and were nothing special but still perfectly fried and plentiful. Sweeney’s must make their tartar from scratch because this stuff was damn near perfect especially when combined with the tasty perch. Usually when a place has the fish, fries and tartar on lockdown all they need to do is throw out a simple slaw and a slice of bread to complete the package. Sweeney’s follows this philosophy to a ‘T’. If you are a huge fan of slaw this is probably not going to be your favorite Fish Fry but it was just fine for me. It wasn’t incredibly tasty but simple and straight forward. The slice of rye was also simple but tasted just fine with the fish even without the butter that I found only after devouring my heap of fried goods. It turns out Sweeney’s is really a bar-bar, (and a Cubs bar at that) so it really isn’t the most kid friendly Fish Fry. $12 for a plate of perch at a bar might seem high but I would say it is well worth every penny. In fact the place is packed to the gills every Friday with people willing to wait outside for a table to get their hands on this fish so I assume they agree. I can easily look past the Cubs regalia on the walls and focus my attention on the delicious Fish Fry they are serving. Hey, if Charlie Shortino is showing up on Friday night they must be doing something right. www.facebook.com/OakcrestTavern?sk=wall5371 Old Middleton RoadMadison, WI 53705     (608) 233-1243",2992,0.20010515873015872,0.5114844322344321

Unfortunately, with so many other places on the docket I was never able fulfill my own desires and Sweeney’s had gone unvisited for well over a year. Since we had plans to meet some friends Downtown I figured this would be a good opportunity to hit up the near Westside establishment. Plus the Badger hockey team was in action and I knew Sweeney’s would have it on lockdown. We arrived just before 8pm and, as per usual, it was standing room only. We put our name on the list and were delighted to learn that we were only a couple from the end. By the time we had a couple sips from our drinks and got caught up on the game the table was ready and our party of four was seated. On Fridays there are two Fish Fry options at the Oakcrest: Lake Perch for $12 and Cod for $10 (I think the Cod was available in 2 or 3 piece, but don’t quote me on that). I knew both were good, but I recalled liking the Perch more the last time so I went that way again.The Fish Fry was ready in about 10 minutes and was nice and hot, just how you want it. My Chinet was piled high with an amalgamation of Perch and French fries, an intermingling of fried delights suited for a prince. The two paper cups on the side, one filled with tartar, the other with slaw, along with a single slice of rye bread completed the jumbled mass of perfection I was to consume.The Perch was absolutely outstanding. The fish was light and flaky and the batter had a great consistency and good flavor. It probably could have used a hint more salt, as Jiggs Man pointed out, but it was still great just how it was. The French fries were crinkle cut and I would assume are normally outstanding. Mine were good but were slightly over fried so I can’t say they were perfect, just bad luck. The tartar sauce was great though and made polishing off the Perch no problem. The portion was huge and mayo/relish ratio was right on the money. This Fish Fry and the hockey team were both doing well so far.Usually I can’t stomach rye bread but the little slice at the Oakcrest was all right. It was especially good when grouped with the homemade looking coleslaw which by itself was also not very appetizing. It was a great taste combination which helped to round out a great Fish Fry. The service at the Oakcrest is surprisingly good considering the close proximity of the tables, that is to say THIS PLACE IS TINY. The waitresses seemed to have no issues gliding about the floor and slinging delicious platefuls of fish upon their eager patrons. The Badger’s somehow went on to lose the game even though they were up 3-2 with less than 15 seconds left. Regardless of the score we still won because we had some great fish with great friends. Overall, this is a fantastic Fish Fry. Sure, we had to wait about 10 minutes but, with fish this good I’m surprised there isn’t a line all the way out the door and a 40 minute wait on Friday nights. I know the locals love this place but if they aren’t careful so will everyone else. www.facebook.com/OakcrestTavern?sk=wall5371 Old Middleton RoadMadison, WI 53705     (608) 233-1243",3151,0.27779468044393424,0.5721563428279846

The New Glarus Brewery is one of the US preeminent microbreweries and justifiably so  every beer they produce is an excellent representation of its style. From pale ale to barely wine and everything in between, NGB always seems to deliver. They have gained so much fanfare over the years some of the other great things in town have been overshadowedgreat things like the Glarner Stube. The Stube has fabulous food, starting with their traditional Swiss fondue. The ooey gooey melty goodness comes in a massive crock and stays liquefied throughout the entire dipping process thanks to its own burner. The gargantuan portion does serious damage to any hunger and while its a tough task to take on before a plate of Friday Fish, its something that simply must be done. The Glarner Fry is composed of a $17.00 lake perch or the more popular $13.00 cod. Both fish share the same hefty beer batter which is a bit much on the 3 delicate perch butterflies but well-suited to the meatier cod. While the perch itself is smooth and flaky it gets lost under the beefy coating while the cod is more balanced. Roesti are a traditional Swiss hash brown-style potato and although they cost a couple bucks extra, are well worth it. The spuds come family style, are loaded with Swiss cheese, and really hit the sweet spot. When all was said and done our stomachs were stuffed and all that remained on the mother plate was a translucent sheen of grease. Big beer batters necessitate a big and bold tartar sauce and the Stubes stuff fit the bill. It was pungent but came in a tiny cup that didnt even last until the perch was gone. Alas, I could likely have gotten more, but was so stuffed with fondue and Roesti that it wasnt even necessary. In addition to all the melty cheese and deep fried delights there was also a choice between soup, salad, or slaw, which seemed like a prime opportunity to do something a bit healthier. The salad of mixed greens I chose was crisp and clean, but little else. There was also no bread served although maybe it was just kept on reserve since we had plenty with the fondue? I dont know, but regardless, I dont think it would have gotten eaten if it had come. The Glarner Stube is a special place and really piles on the food like few others can. While the batter on the perch wasnt prefect nearly everything else was which made for an all-around enjoyable experience. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry but highly recommend the Glarner Stube in general. Its a gem. www.glarnerstube.com/518 1st StreetNew Glarus, WI 53704     (608) 527-2216",2630,0.15489892660945292,0.5058361813624972

Not only is there a world-class brewery to meander through, but several great restaurants await hungry beer guzzlers once theyve completed their suds-soaked romp on the hill. Its a proper playground for the 21+ crowd, especially for those who are fans of the Friday Fish Fry. The crown jewel in the New Glarus Fish Fry hierarchy is the legendary Glarner Stube. The Stube is well known for their authentic Swiss cuisine, especially their fondue, their Roesti potatoes, and their various schnitzels and wursts. It is a true gastro paradise, which, of course, features an amazing AYCE Fish Fry on Fridays. Be warned  The Stube gets busy, and I do mean busy. There is no skimping at The Stube and as such their All You Can Eat Fish Fry is offered all day long  whether youre up for AYCE or not. Small portions are out of the question in New Glarus with the AYCE cod running $13, and non-AYCE lake perch option going for $17  both complete with all the trimmings. In addition to our fish we couldnt resist ordering a side of their signature fondue and a couple fresh taps of Spotted Cow. Our fondue came in no time and was nothing less than delicious. The Swiss cheese based sauce was potent, and featured a noticeable stank that really gave the crusty bread chunks a run for their money. While the gigantic crock is a little expensive at $16 it is meant to be shared, and winds up being worth it when all is said and done (it is a ton of food  order at your own risk). Once we made our way through most of the goo, the fish arrived and our focus shifted. The cod looked just amazing, as the two hefty pieces were cloaked in a golden beer batter that glowed under the houselights. Even though the chunks were huge, they were surprisingly light and incredibly flavorful. The beer batter was rich and creamy, and paired perfectly with the pure, flaky fish. It was expertly done, and even though it was AYCE, I was full after round one thanks to the filling fondue and the puffy potatoes. Even though I knew better, I simply couldnt resist upgrading one of my sides to the Roesti potatoes for an additional couple bucks. The traditional Swiss hash brown loaf (which comes on its own plate) was massive and infused with a ton of Swiss cheese that made it formidable. It was a lot to pile on top of the fish and the fondue, but it was just too good not too. Capping the peaks of the cod mountain was a tangy, homemade tartar that had some snap, but didnt really stand up to the brawny fish. It also had a few too many capers in it for our tastes, but in general they faded into the mildly and creamy mix without too much of a fight. Besides the bread that came with the fondue, none came with the fish (which was a bit surprisingly). This left the creamy coleslaw to fend for itself which was somewhat problematic since the homemade mix was good, but not great. If you like great beer, New Glarus is the place for you. If you like amazing food, New Glarus is the place for you. If you like great beer and lots of amazing food at the same time, then The Glarner Stube is definitely the place for you. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish Fry and have to say it is easily one of the best the Madison area has to offer. It is impressive, as are all things at The Stube. www.glarnerstube.com/518 1st StreetNew Glarus, WI 53704     (608) 527-2216",3412,0.2803036075036075,0.5493204906204906

To our surprise, we had arrived just in time to help the locals celebrate Oktoberfest. Celebrating the harvest in a Swiss community was news to us, but apparently not to the droves of citizens who turned out and turned the downtown into a classic German-style beer garden. Patrons were aglow with their Staghorn mugs, routinely refilling them with from the river of New Glarus brews which flowed forth. Even though we were not here to partake in the festing we were practically swept up by the current and eventually tossed ashore into the bustling Glarner Stube.Apparently, Glarner Stube translates to The Living Room of New Glarus which seems to make a lot of sense especially if you consider the closed street outside as the ""front yard of New Glarus."" The Stube was crammed with hungry folks, but we somehow managed to find the hostess (under the huge copper hood) and get our name on the list. An hour wait was in store, which gave us plenty of time to grab a table and take in the Swissy sights. After pounding a few pints I really wished I had sprung for the for the fest mug as it would have been a nice souvenir and been well worth the cost due to the cheap refills which were available throughout the local establishments. Oh well, we shall not dwell on that which we cannot change on to the fish.Our wait flew by, thanks in part to the booze, but also to the eclectic crowd drawn by the Glarner Stube. Lets just say, these folks know how to eat, and do it well. We were seated almost to the minute of our quoted time, and entered the fully loaded dining room just before 8PM. We had nary a second to catch our breath before our well seasoned waitress was upon us with menus, and drink inquiries. Since we had ample time to study their offerings prior to arriving in the dining room we were ready for her - fondue and marinated peppers for the little lady, and the AYCE cod and a Spotted Cow for me (perch was also available for $14, but I had already perched for lunch). At the time I was unaware that the cod was AYCE since that tidbit is not listed anywhere on the Friday Specials placard, but as it turns out, I was glad it was. Prior to our entrees we were treated to a full blown basket of bread, complete with packaged crackers, breadsticks, and homemade slices. In addition, the Fish Fry came with a soup/salad option of which I opted for the Prime Rib soup. All were good (although the soup was a bit bizarre), and set us up well for the fondue which came shortly after. Being an authentic Swiss restaurant the Stube specializes in fondue and has the tools of the trade to prove it. Our huge ceramic kettle was mounted atop a fancy-schmancy burner and crammed full of the cheesy goodness. We grabbed our skewers, stabbed some bread, and had at it. Even though this was my first fondue experience I can say without a doubt, that this was good fondue. It had a smooth texture and a really interesting taste which stemmed from the wine, kirsh and swiss cheese. It was almost sweet, but almost sour at the same time. It danced on the palate and played out it flavors in each and every bite. Well before the copious amount of fondue was exhausted the fish appeared and I refocused my efforts.The cod at the Stube is labeled simply as cod, but it was clear when it appeared that it was beer battered. It emerged from the kitchen and was alarmingly hot when set down. Try as I may, I could not get my hands on the golden fried little buggers and had to crack them open to release some of the internal steam. When a piece finally reached my mouth I was greeted by an array of tastes. The fish itself was incredibly flaky as each individual sheet fell apart effortlessly. The batter did its best to hold it together, but failed on more than one occasion. While it wasnt exceptionally flavorful, the batter did its job nicely, and didnt get overly greasy, although a tiny bit did accumulate. Overall, it was very good and I managed to get four large pieces down atop my liberal intake of fondue.Accompanying the $12 cod was the Roesti which I was talked into trying for a $2 up charge. In lieu of French fries the Roesti made a suitable companion to the fish, although the gigantic portion was somewhat overwhelming. They were essentially a cheesy hash brown-like pie and were very good, although the sheer quantity of them pushed my stomach to its breaking point. If there is one thing I learned about the Stube, it is that you will not go home hungry, trust me on that one.Rounding out the Fish Fry was their homemade tartar sauce which was thick and creamy, but had a noticeable lemon zest. The zest was a bit over the top and really dominated the flavor of the sauce. In fact, it even shrouded the fish in lemon-ness when applied liberally. By and large, it was pretty decent, but like too much dill, too much lemon is never a good thing. I would much prefer a lighter dousing in the actual sauce and a wedge or two on the side that I could use, or not, based on my personal taste. On the whole it wasnt that big of a deal, but I gotta tell it like it is. When all was said and done, my overloaded belly and I retired to bathroom to evacuate some of the liquids that we enjoyed whilst waiting for our table. Upon entering the tiny lavatory I was met with a majestic site, which I instantly dubbed the 8th Wonder of the World. In addition to being home to great food, the Stube is home to what must be the largest urinal in the history of mankind. The ceramic monolith was simply incredible. It comprised a good 1/3 of the tiny space, dwarfing the sink and toilet combined. I grinned like a schoolboy at recess as I proudly took advantage of its abundance. As I exited the commode I found myself at a point of extreme satisfaction. I had a great meal with my beautiful wife, and was leaving with stories to tell about the wild little village of New Glarus. Overall, this was simply a fantastic meal, Fish Fry related or not. Im sure the Swiss specialties at the Stube are nothing to scoff at and we will be sure to come back someday with intentions on getting the Wiener schnitzel or some other local delicacy. As it stands, this is easily a highly recommendable Fish Fry and the Stube is just one of those places you have to try. If for no other reason, you at least need to go check out the bathroom, it is truly a sight to behold much like Old Faithful or the Grand Canyon. Apparently they like BIG things in New Glarus: AYCE Fish Fry, Oktoberfest rowdiness, huge portions, and mammoth urinals. When you amalgamate all this massiveness one thing becomes perfectly clear, the Glarner Stube is glaringly spectacular. www.glarnerstube.com/518 1st StreetNew Glarus, WI 53704     (608) 527-2216",6828,0.1867918037518037,0.4843102453102453

I consider Friday Fish Fry to be just such an opportunity and since there are a fair amount of options around campus I rounded up Gabe and we headed down there to see what we could find. What we found was a convenient spot in Lukcys parking lot and a $7 lunch Fish Fry special. For your seven bucks you get either lake perch or cod, with crinkle cut fries, and a side of tartar. No slaw, no bread. Between the two of us we got one order of perch and one cod and waited for our server to bring it around. About 20 minutes or so later we had hot plates of fish at our disposal.The 3 good sized perch fillets were a little firm, but tasted good. They enjoyed a light batter, although it could have been flakier. The same batter adorned the as cod which was also good, but much greasier than its counterpart. Overall they were both tasty, although the cod apparently didnt sit well with the Gabester. He also mentioned it was spotty, with one piece being very good and one not so much. In contrast, my perch was very consistent from piece to piece. However, my portion of crinkle fries were a mixed bag, much like the cod. Some were super hot while others were lukewarm. They were fine overall but certainly nothing special. The tartar was also so-so anda little heavy on the dill. This dilly sauce didnt really improve the taste of the perch.  I actually remembered the Fish Fry at Luckys being a little better than this. The fish, fries and tartar were all passable, but the lack of coleslaw and bread is really a killer since they are basically staples in any good Fry. Overall I think this Fish Fry is recommendable, but just barely due to the fact it is missing some key components.www.luckysbarandgrille.com/1421 Regent StreetMadison, WI 53711     (608) 250-8989",1889,0.19562233836624085,0.42499612853271374

The cost of fish is up, but paychecks are not. People still want their Fish Fry, but simply cant pay more for it. Establishments want to give them that fish, but certainly cant do it at a loss. Whats one to do? In the case of Nicks you pull a fast one well, maybe not a fast one per se, but you make a subtle switch and hope no one notices it. We didWe have been fans of Nicks for some time now and thought their lake perch special was one a heck of a deal  coming in under 10 bucks. It had been a while since our last visit to the State Street mainstay, and since that time something has changed (although you wont hear Nicks bragging about it). Apparently, the price of the lake perch has shot through the roof (according to a chef friend of mine) and rather than take the risk of raising their price to the necessary $12 or so to keep the lake lovers happy, Nicks has chosen to jump ship and take a chance with the ocean option. However, you wont see the term Ocean advertised anywhere  it is now simply billed as: Perch - $9.25. Most people dont notice the change, I assume.While the two distinct fish varieties share the name perch that is about where the similarities end. They taste dramatically different, have different textures, and even smell different when fried. While OP is fine if done right, it rarely, if ever, holds a candle to its freshwater brethren; in fact, even bad lake perch is often better than good ocean perch. In short, OP is no LP. Before the fish Nicks treats you to their homemade Greek soup, sesame seed rolls, and stank-tacular slaw. The soup was good, kind of milky-looking with a little bit of a sour aftertaste. Like the hamburger bun turned roll, it was inoffensive and a nice precursor to the upcoming plate of fried delights. The coleslaw on the other hand was offensive to each and every sense, but in a way that was oh-so-good. This stuff is a knock-down drag-out body-slammer, with a pungent vinegar blast that is not for the faint of heart (or of sensitive taste bud). While I had no trouble crushing the whole cup, the creamy coleslaw lovers at the table couldnt handle to potent punch, and quickly pushed it aside. Nicks slaw is clearly not for everyone. The fish came quickly thereafter and was hot as can be. After the soup, rolls, and slaw beforehand all that was left for the finale were three big pieces of fish, a small side plate of fries, and cup of tartar. While I would still much prefer the lake perch of yesteryear, the ocean perch was really good. The fillets were thick and meaty, without being overly fishy tasting. They sported a light and crumbly breading that really stood up well to the perch without overwhelming it.Following the fish was a Spartan portion of beer battered fries which were delicious and crispy. The perfectly cooked potatoes were simply superb with the only downfall being their scant numbers. Nicks tartar was, and always has been, right on the money. It is the consummate sauce that is thick and creamy, just as it was meant to be. What can you say? Nicks is a cool place, and must be doing something right to be where they have been for all these years. Clearly they have a formula which involves keeping everything in moderation, especially prices. While I cant say I blame them, and they actually pulled off the ocean perch transition pretty well, I would still rather pay a little more for the real deal. Overall, we still recommend the perch Fish Fry at Nicks, but cant help but feel a little something has been lost.nicksrestaurantmadison.com226 State StreetMadison, WI 53703     (608) 255-5450",3629,0.1942345295606165,0.5604727398205659

There are some Greeks on State Street and they have a philosophy too, serve a great Friday Night Fish Fry for a fair price in no time flat.We were heading to the Union Terrace for an 8pm show so we showed up at Nick’s around 7. Our friend Jer beat us there and grabbed the big open table in the front window out of the many options available. He had already ordered some beers and when the waitress came back with them we placed our orders. We both went for the lake perch, but I opted for French fries and he went with the hash browns (with cheese and onions). Now, the perch only costs about nine clams, but that in no way means Nick’s is going to cheap out. First they give you some authentic Greek soup which, while devoid of meat, is still really good. In addition, they give you a nice warm sesame seed roll for dipping. We polished off the soup and waited about 5 more minutes for the fish.The perch is usually served as a 3-piece but since the waitress felt they were small orders she threw in an extra piece (I think she was just sweet on Jer, but can’t really be sure). The pieces were actually quite thick and although not huge, they were plenty meaty. The order would have been worth the $9 price tag even without the fourth one, but I sure am not one to complain about extra fish. The fish itself was fairly light and flaky but tasted like it would benefit from a fryer grease swap. It, like my fish at Schneid’s earlier in the day, wanted to get greasy quickly but was still hot and good.  The French fries were thick and straight cut; they were not great and had that “fry shell” that repels salt like a shield. Ultimately, I still would take them over the traditional boiled potato or the hash browns, which I can’t recall a positive comment about. The tartar was fairly good and super creamy which really helped it stick to the slick perch.After enjoying it immensely for the second time I can say this is my favorite coleslaw. Madison Fish Fry is a huge fan of Sea Salt & Vinegar Kettle Chips and this stuff packs a punch much the same way. Many people probably don’t like theirs this pungent but I swear I have seen God in this slaw. At first bite it is a potent slam. Then you stray away to enjoy a bite of fish with the perfect proportion of tartar atop. When you come back the true fury of the slaw is released on your palate and it hits you like a shockwave. It is divinity. I have to say I am amazed that Nick’s is as empty as it is on Friday nights. The place could certainly use a sprucing up but I have never really had to wait for a table even though the fish is very good. The fries could have been better but again above average tartar sauce helped to overshadow them. The service has been great on both visits and the slaw is out of this world. I would have to say the hypothesis has been proven. Nick’s Restaurant in the heart of downtown is great little Fish Fry and one of Madison’s most overlooked.nicksrestaurantmadison.com226 State StreetMadison, WI 53703     (608) 255-5450",3208,0.2531606179208919,0.5096985510684142

The long time State Street establishment has been poked and prodded from just about every angle. Some seem to love its old school appeal while others simply find it outdated, over-rated and kind of nasty. Since I had only been to Nick’s one time and before a concert at the Orpheum to boot, I figured they were due a proper chance to prove their worth in the Fish Fry arena. During the previous dinner the place was packed, this time it was quite a different story.Since it was Boys State Basketball weekend I again mistakenly thought State Street would be hopping. It turned out that we had no problem finding a parking spot on the street or a table at Nick’s. We arrived at 8pm and were welcomed by the two waitresses to sit wherever were so desired. Basically every table was open, save for the one large group of authentic Greek folks. We picked a dingy little both near the front and looked over our menus. Nick’s has a couple options for fish on Friday: number one is Haddock for $9.25 and the second is Lake Perch for $9.00. I went for the Perch and am really pleased I did. Before the main course I was treated to a lovely bowl of their authentic Greek soup and a hot, soft roll, both of which were excellent. Our food came about 10 minutes or so after and was nice and hot. I was a little worried at first when I only say 3 fillets; luckily they were very large and actually just about right when all was said and done. The fish itself was very good as was the breading which was light, flaky and very easy on the grease. Normally the Fish Fry is served with some boiled potato or something but the lovely young waitress allowed me to substitute French fries. The fries looked homemade and tasted great, smooth move on my part. The tartar sauce was not as good as the fries but certainly was no spoiler. What really put this Fish Fry over the top for me was the absolutely awesome, straight-up coleslaw. It was nothing more than cabbage and vinegar but it was delicious. I actually ate the whole dish and wished I had more. Some people might not like it this strong but I could not have been happier.Overall I was very pleased with Nick’s on this trip. Yeah the place is a little dark and isn’t exactly brimming with cleanliness, but you know that going in. The food was very good and the service was great, partially because the place was empty, but so what, I’ll take it. This trip was definitely better than my previous visit and even that time was pretty good. I am glad to say Nick’s is a fine place to grab Fish Fry downtown on a Friday night which is nice because The Avenue and The Old Fashioned can get old after a while.nicksrestaurantmadison.com226 State StreetMadison, WI 53703     (608) 255-5450",2779,0.2615588803088803,0.554527027027027

Why the venerable Monroe Street establishment is never mentioned in the same breath as these more acclaimed bars is beyond me especially when you consider their Fish Fry is better than all of theirs (if they even have one). The dining room at the Laurel is always packed on Friday nights and there is almost no way you are getting in without waiting for a while, even if you show up by 5:30 like we did. On Fridays they have walleye and cod available, and this was a walleye week for me. Despite the fact they were busy the kitchen clearly knows the drill and turns things over in a flash. For starters there is a soup/salad/slaw option with any of the fish and I went for the chowder which was creamy and balanced. While I would like to see more clam (I think we all would) there were at least some pieces present. The fish followed in short order and looked quite intriguing. Now, I don't work at the Laurel, I have never seen their kitchen, and I don't know their business practices, but the walleye seemed a little fishy to me today (no pun intended). The usual way walleye is served is a single large fillet from an adult fish. Such fillets average around 8-10 inches in length, are shaped like a warped isosceles triangle, and tend to curl in from the sides when fried. I have come to expect ""baby pike"" from the Laurel which are served as three smaller fillets that tend to curl from end to end. These babies didn't carry the signature musk that an adult walleye does and in all honesty had the look and flavor of pike-perch (which is often substituted for the local species). Even so, the beer batter that encased the fillets was superb, boasting lots of flavor and an excellent crunch, so, while it may or may not have been actual walleye (I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and say it was) it was still quite enjoyable. The side of note at the Laurel are the hash browns O'brien which are just your basic shreds topped with Swiss cheese and a sautéed onion and green pepper mixture. Since I wasn't feeling the peppers I just ordered mine regular with the Swiss and some raw onion. It turned out to be a very nice rendition with delightfully crispy edges and ooey gooey insides. Their zippy tartar added a distinctive allure to the smooth fish while a funky and dense multi-grain roll was a definite step above the basic bun. I know, I know, there are a lot of bars in Madison and they can't all make headlines, but for once it would nice to see a place like the Laurel get some love. Sure, they don't give you free beer on your birthday or have a swanky State Street address, but they do have good food and a down home vibe that I for one appreciate more than either of those other things. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and think the Laurel is one of the more overlooked establishments in our fair city, especially when it comes to food. thelaureltavern.com/2505 Monroe StreetMadison, WI 53711     (608) 270-3600",3087,0.204392791304556,0.47043979985156464

We took the trip down to Monroe Street the first chance we got and thoroughly enjoyed every morsel of the freshwater fish, vowing to return shortly. It was only a couple months before we made good on that promise, but alas, the bluegill was nowhere to be found. We were definitely disappointed, but took solace in the fact that the Laurels famous walleye was still available for the taking. And take we did. For starters, the Laurel is one of those neighborhood bars that clearly appreciates their regulars, but it can come at the expense of those they dont see every day. On our recent visits we were able to procure a barstool instantly only to sit and wait for several minutes for the bartender to come over even though we caught his eye almost immediately. Eventually well get a beer and an order in, but its almost as if they want you to prove your worth by not getting fed up and walking out first. Good thing were stubborn when it comes to our fish. The Laurel serves an ample amount of fish on Friday and it takes a good 15 minutes or so to get your grub even if you dont have a big group. In the meantime your soup/salad option will arrive and help to pass the time. The slaw is rich, creamy, and zesty, making the homemade mix too tasty to pass up for clam chowder or a house salad (although many still do).Its hard to not down the entire big bowl of slaw before the fish arrives, but if youre like us you try to save some of it to have with the rest of the meal. The main focus of said meal is the baby pike that takes up about ¾ of the large dinner plate. The three pieces of flaky fish feature an airy batter that practically floats off the fish. Its mild texture and flavor complement the silky, baby walleye perfectly pulling it into impeccable balance. The Laurels specialty spud is hash browns OBrien, but we had fries on the mind. The well-salted, well-fried, crinkles arrived in a big portion and were just what youd expect them to be. No complaints here. A thick and zippy tartar also avoided ridicule as it flattered the fish just as it should. Dinner rolls are a dime a dozen and while the Laurel goes beyond the regular potato roll its not all that far beyond. Its just fine and well happily take that. The Laurel Tavern is a pretty great local spot and has some of the best fish on the west side in our opinion. While we were disappointed that the bluegill was gone, and that the hospitality is lacking, its not near enough for us to write them off. Overall, we continue to highly recommend this Fish Fry and youll likely catch us chowing down on Monroe again before long. thelaureltavern.com/2505 Monroe StreetMadison, WI 53711     (608) 270-3600",2801,0.1930952380952381,0.5136954071569456

There has been a resurgence in popularity for the pintsized fish recently due to places like Tobys Supper Club and Dexters Pub doing such a fine job with it. More and more people are asking where the can find it, and more and more places are stepping to the plate with their own unique offerings. Since I knew the Laurel has an amazing walleye I figured their new gill would fall right in line with it. I was right.First things first, the bluegill at the Laurels is eeekspensive, coming in at a whopping $15.50! That said, the portion is on the large side (9 fat pieces), but that is still getting up there. Before the fish comes around, a cup of the Laurels homemade slaw shows up looking like its all thatand it is. This stuff is rich and creamy, and incredibly tasty. Everything in it is in perfect balance and youd be hard pressed to find many better slaws out there. There is also an option to substitute a cup of clam chowder or a salad, but those who know stick with the slaw. After the slaw showed it took a good 15 minutes for the fish to arrive, but it was as hot as can be when it did. The bluegill was superb and featured a breading was on the thick side as far as breadings go, but had a ton of flavor. The copious seasoning suppressed the bluegill taste for the most part, but still resulted in a harmonious flavor sensation. There are a few different tater options at the Laurel and I settled on the regular hash browns over the French fries or the hash browns Obrien (the Obies have cheese and green pepper instead of cheese and onion and I wanted nothing to do with the green peppers). The regular hash browns came in a regular portion and were well fried. The thick shreds appeared to be grated in-house and tasted fine, but were nothing really special. Well-seasoned fish usually needs a sassy tartar to balance it out and that is just what the Laurel delivers. Their thick and creamy version complements the bluegill to a T and really spread the taste sensation across the palate. Last on the list was a fresh and crusty roll that improved upon a standard dinner roll, but not by much. I had a sneaking suspicion that the Laurel would do bluegill justice and I have to say I was dead on. While it is super expensive, it is pretty much justified and I didnt leave felling ripped off or anything close to it. Overall, we highly recommend this Fish ry and certainly wont hesitate to drop another 62 quarters on it. Its well worth every Washington. thelaureltavern.com/2505 Monroe StreetMadison, WI 53711     (608) 270-3600",2631,0.2081187209017398,0.4960526580337902

Say its old. Say its run down. Say the carpet is dingy. Say whatever it is you want to say about it; just hold your tongue when it comes to the Fish Fry. Like any good neighborhood bar, The Laurel features fish on Friday that you cant get any other day of the week. They trot out the usual suspects of cod and walleye, but do a fine job with both of them. This time around I chose the walleye which comes in at a reasonable $13.00  just a couple bucks more than the baked or fried cod.While we waited for our food my side of slaw showed up and the festivities began. The homemade slaw was creamy and unique, nothing less than superb. There was something special about it (garlic?) that made it almost irresistible. Perhaps it was just the anticipation for the fish, but whatever it was the slaw spanned the gap splendidly. The headliner arrived booth-side within 10 minutes or so of the slaw and looked just right. While the three medium-sized walleye fillets looked superb they were slightly different from what I was expecting. The walleye I remember had a lighter textured breading that practically flaked right off. This rendition was slightly thicker, but equally spicy and delicious. It clung to the fish with force making sure every bite of the wonderful walleye was coated. Despite the fact the portion was princely I put down every last bite without thinking twice about it. When I asked for hash browns with cheese and onion I meant just that  hash browns with cheese and onion. Apparently what the waitress heard was Hash browns Obrien which do contain said cheese and onion, but also add some salsa to the mix that totally alters the flavors. While the salsa wasnt expected, it wasnt necessarily a bad thing, but I think Id still prefer the plain C&O and would specify it as such next time. Bolstering an already star-studded cast was The Laurels homemade tartar sauce. While it arrived in a standard Solo cup the thick and creamy sauce was anything but ordinary. It blended perfectly with the walleye putting forth a new fantastic flavor which neither could have achieved on its own. The Laurels bread of choice are the little football-shape loaves that have a crusty exterior. If nothing else, they are a step up from the regular round-top-square-sided dinner roll, which is worth an extra point in our book. The Laurel isnt exactly a huge place, and since they have a steady stream of regulars you can expect a short wait if you arrive at 7pm like we did. Luckily, it will be extremely tolerable, as the bartenders are attentive and hospitable. Overall, we highly recommend the walleye Fish Fryat The Laurel Tavern, and thats really all we have to say about that. thelaureltavern.com/2505 Monroe StreetMadison, WI 53711     (608) 270-3600",2811,0.1922295079648021,0.5213359842771607

In this day and age where we are constantly being bombarded by information, we can become over-saturated, so much so that it clouds our judgment. Sometimes having all the info helps to make decisions easier, but sometimes it only serves to pull us in the wrong direction by reinforcing the negatives rather than accentuating the positives. Case and point  The Laurel Tavern. I have known about the Fish Fry at the Laurel for a long time, but for one reason or another simply never gave it the time of day. Mostly it was due to the fact that all reviews I have read about the place have been mixed (including those from close personal friends). Some say that the Fish Fry is out of this world, while others claim that the place is a dump and smells like a sewer. Rather than risk my Friday Fish Fry on a questionable place, I have always managed to come up with other alternatives. Well, I am here to tell you now; I made a mistake in putting this one off. The Laurel really does have a GREAT Fish Fry.My Fish Fry friendly crew and I pulled in to the Laurel just after 8pm, and I was pleased to see that the place was still pretty busy (a sign that the Fish Fry is sought after). We gave our name to the hostess and grabbed a beer or two after she gave us the 5 minute wait routine. 10 minutes or so later she found us at the bar and escorted us to our table in the dining room. We sat, sipped our beers, one of us spilled his Old Fashioned all over his lap, and a few minutes later the waitress made her appearance. The crew pretty much all went for cod - although Paul had to be guilted into it after trying to order a veggie burger. I went for the $12 walleye plate and was glad I did. The fish came about 15 minutes or so after our orders went in and was nice and hot when served. I tore into the plate even though the delicious cheese curds that had come beforehand filled me up somewhat. The walleye fillets were not huge, but since there were three of them it more than made up for any lack in size. The fish was simply outstanding. It was incredibly light and flaky although some grease did appear about ½ way through. I made sure to rotate them to keep it from settling which was a smart move on my part. This rotation helped to keep the batter in good shape and thankfully so since it was so tasty. This batter was well seasoned and really gave the walleye something hang its hat on, it was divine. Looking back on it, this may actually be the best walleye I have ever had, which is really saying something. Reports around the table were that the cod was also very good, although I couldn't even stomach a single bite after polishing off my walleye and the 10 or so curds that proceeded it. The cousins of the curds - the crinkle cut fries - were also good, but nothing special even with the hint of season salt sprinkled across their exteriors. The walleye was so flavorful that it was edible all by itself, but the tartar that accompanied it really put it over the top. It was nice and creamy with just a hint of relish, and while it was served in a tiny cup it still outlasted the walleye which in my book really says something about the quality of the fish. Putting the finishing touches on the meal was some zest-less slaw and a forgotten roll. The slaw was unremarkable and the roll, while I thought it was decent, was hardly touched by anyone at the table except for yours truly. Meh. The Laurel clearly draws a local crowd; from the Metro bus driver to the UW professor on the down low, all classes were represented. From what I could tell, pretty much everyone in attendance was there for the Fish Fry and I can't say I blame them. The walleye was simply great and we will definitely be back for it sometime soon. I guess it just goes to show you, you can't believe everything you hear; sometimes you need to try things for yourself and form your own opinion. Here is ours  The Laurel Tavern has a kickass Fish Fry.

It's been around for almost a decade and a half now, and they are still doing primarily the same thing they've done since they day they opened. Madison, and it's tourists, are clearly okay with the genre they've helped to define, and it shows in the extensive waits for a table on Fridays. To prove that point, we showed up for lunch at about 12:30 and felt fortunate to find a couple open barstools, more or less an actual table.The OF still has the specials they had 12 years ago, and since we don't go very often, and have sampled them all at one point or another, we stuck with the #57 (the lake perch for those of you that like to order by actual words instead of numbers). This perch is the same perch we had many times over the years - light breading (in color and texture) with no seasoning whatsoever. It's flour power at it's most primitive which places all the heavy lifting on the fish. Thankfully, this is the real deal perch and while it can shoulder the load to some extent, although even the most pristine fish could us a leg up here and there. As has become the Old Fashioned's calling card, a load of shoestring style French fries litter the plate. These fries are crisp enough and really do the job, but fall into the same ""good, not great"" category as the fish. The thin tartar with minimal zip is also a bit bland but does the job for the most part. One place the OF makes a bit of a mark is with some real Milwaukee style rye, and a cool poppyseed pelted slaw that is ample and unique. Neither of these things make this can make Fish Fry great on their own, but they help things just enough to make it better than average overall. What can we say? The Old Fashioned just does what they do and since they are bringing in plenty of business just how they are why would they consider changing anything? It really is a fine Fry, and while it's not one of the best, the only way you could be truly disappointed is if you went in with very high expectations (which I think a lot of people do unfortunately). Overall, we still recommend this Fish Fry and think it's good enough, but feel like if could (and should) be so much more. www.theoldfashioned.com23 N.

Weve had out differences in the past, but we have reconciled at least to some extent. There was a time when we thought this fish downright stank. Then again, there was a day when we thought this was a de facto Top 10 Madison area Fish Fry. While both of those days have long since vanished in the rearview we still think its pretty decent all things considered. The OF takes their Friday special seriously as cod, walleye, and lake perch all are offered individually or as a tantalizing trio. Ive sampled them all in days gone by and have found the lake perch to be the best of the bunch, so that is what I opted for this time around. The $13.00 plate came with a half priced Spotted Cow since it was Craft Beer Week which made it a really square deal, especially for a Square-side establishment. The fish arrived punctually and definitely had the look. 3 butterflies were stacked high on a pile of the Old Fashs ubiquitous matchstick fries. The light dusting of flour and egg that smothered the perch didnt have much flavor but had a great texture and let the fish be itself. This pale riders are far from the best youll find, but also nowhere near the worst. Its just good, inoffensive perch, and most importantly the actual real deal yellow perch.The Old Fashioneds fries are always a crowd pleaser and home to a satisfying crunch, and supple centers. The portion is always plentiful which ensures theyre around long after the fish is gone which is alright by me. If there is a failing with the Fry at the Fash its the tartar (if theres a failing). While their homemade sauce isnt the best, like everything else, it makes the grade. Its creamy (which is obviously a good thing), but also has a few too many capers (which is obviously not a good thing). Luckily, they make up for the unwanted pickled buds with real rye bread which is an extreme rarity in 2016. The stanky starch pulls this Fish Fry up a few notches (at least for me). The last item on the list is some homemade slaw which is as inoffensive as they come. Its fresh and pleasant and in the top quarter of slaws out there. If its Friday you know the Old Fash is going to be busy but our 75 minute quoted wait quickly eroded into a brief 25 minutes, so you know theyre hedging their bets at this point. All that aside, this is still a decent Fish Fry and one were happy to take part in from time to time as necessary. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry, and think it just does what it needs to do. When you gotta be downtown on a Friday the OF is always OK  www.theoldfashioned.com23 N. Pinckney StreetMadison, WI 53703     (608) 310-4545",2656,0.17727832512315272,0.48318555008210184

While many people love its modern take on the traditional Wisconsin supper club other lambast it for being generic, uninspired, or just the place you take relatives from out of town who want the downtown experience but are too scared to try something new. I have never been one of the true malcontents but did think the quality of their Fish Fry fell off to some extent once they became the it place. While I hated to do it I couldnt recommend their Friday special for a while, but Im happy to say theyve come roaring back.On Friday the OF has cod, lake perch, and walleye all day, although if you show up for lunch it wont appear anywhere on the menu, but trust me, its available. The cod comes in at $10, the perch at $13, the walleye at $14, or a combo of all three at $15 for the indecisive folks. While there will likely be a wait for a table (~30 minutes even at lunch) the bar is diverse enough to keep you happy and the bustling street is always great for people watching. Drink it in. The perch is the real deal yellow perch and well-prepared. It rules over the massive plate with its light and crumbly, panko-style breading and mellow flavor. As it should be, the meat is light and flaky; these butterflies practically float on air. While the crispy breading could use a pick me up it is totally grease-free which leaves the belly feeling lively even after all six fillets are gone. Tons of matchstick fries come along for the ride and are nothing new, but as they say - if it aint broke dont fix it. The thick-ish tartar is also in good repair with plenty zip, zap, and all of that. The Old Fash is one of the only places in town that serves rye with their Fish Fry and its a whole slice at that. The stanky slice is a welcome addition to any meal, and really adds a pop that this Fish Fry would be lacking otherwise. The fresh-looking homemade slaw has a pleasant taste, and while it wont knock your socks off, it will at least give em a little tug. Since day one the Old Fashioned has been doing what they can to satisfy the masses and judging by the numbers Id say theyve done just fine. MFF aint no food snob and Im glad to say this one is back in our good graces. Overall, we recommend this Fish Fry and think it is once again one of the best downtown has to offer.  www.theoldfashioned.com23 N.

In reality it was all them, and we really just needed some time apart to clear our heads and try other fish. The quality of their perch had dipped, and we couldnt carry on pretending things were alright. We went our separate ways, and didnt know if wed ever see our old favorite again.Time passed, and as luck would have it we were destined to meet again - this time after Badger hockey game. The OFs semi-recent expansion has eased the pressure on the main dining room somewhat, and we got a table with no trouble (being 9:30 at night probably also played a part). The service at the Square-side smorgasbord has always been great and our waitress was at our side before we even had a chance to shed our winter garb. We placed our orders, got some drinks, and before we knew it had hot food in front of us. The OF was on top of it this Friday. I was famished after watching Bucky bury a bunch of biscuits, and tore into my plate of perch with reckless abandon. On our previous couple visits the perch fillets were limp, lifeless, little twerps which left us unfulfilled and soured. This time things were different. They we better, and we fell in love all over again. The six fillets were large and flaky, and housed a light breading with a delicate blend of seasonings. It was very nicely done, and brought many good memories rushing back. It was just like old times when every Fry was exciting and new. A simply ridiculous amount of shoestring fries came along with the fish and while Im a man who likes his French fries, I mean good god, the whole plate was full, and everything had to be placed on top of the pile. It was just nuts Nuts. Oh yeah, they were also delicious - little salty rays of sunshine, each and every one. I have always been a bit down on the Old Fashioneds homemade tartar sauce, mostly because of the caper contingent. Perhaps theyve adapted, or perhaps Id blown the quirk out of proportion, but this blend was much better than those in my memory. It was thick and creamy, and the capers were not noticeable in the least. It paired nicely with the perch, and gave us something new to hold on to. In classic form the OF serves up a slice of tangy and delicious rye with their Fish Fry. It was so good that it actually boosted the homemade coleslaw which was just so-so on its own. The cabbage derivative was shredded longwise, a little soupy, and a bit heavy on the onion. It just didnt do it for me, but luckily the rye came to the rescue. What can we say? It was an nice to rekindle our relationship with the Old Fashioned, and it looks like clear skies ahead. Overall, we highly recommend the Fish Fry we had this time around, and will no doubt be back before long. It was good to see you again old friend, too much time had passed, let see where things go from here. www.theoldfashioned.com23 N.

We have been to the OF many times and have to say it is one of the neater establishments around, and for a time they rocked one of the photo-friendliest Fish Frys in the city. Lately we have noticed a decline in the overall food quality so when Jer, Paul and I pulled into the downtown speakeasy for a lunch time bite we werent sure what to expect, but suspected the meal would be above average, at the least.The Salt Mine throws a bit of a twist on their regular routine during lunch on Friday as you place your order at the bar and pay up-front (I assume this is to expedite the process so busy Square-goers can get in and out as fast as possible). It did seem to alleviate some of the pressure on the wait staff which is a good thing (if you have ever been here on a Friday you know what Im talking about). I put in for my $13 plate of perch as did Jer, while Mr. Paul went for the cod. We sat around, talked over the folly of local radio stations, and about 15 minutes later had our food.Now, the lake perch at the OF used to (and I emphasize USED TO) be the absolute best in the city. It had something extra that no other perch could match and stood alone at the top. Well, Im not sure what has happened (new cook?  new recipe?), but it just isnt the same. The fish was hot when served, but not steaming hot like it should be. The 3 butterflies were fair sized, but certainly could have been larger especially for the hefty $13 price tag. The once ultra-flavorful batter that made this fish truly unique has really lost some zest. While it is still light and crumbly it just doesnt have the extra oomph that it once did, and a couple pieces actually tasted a little sour to me. Overall, it is still decent, but nowhere near as good as it used to. What exactly is going on here? I wondered. Working in conjunction with the fish, and making it more edible, was the adequately portioned tartar. I say adequate because a couple more fillets would have overpowered the caper-laced goo, but since there was only the three tiny butterflies, it sufficed. The mayo-heavy sauce was actually quite good even though I am not a fan of capers. They were so interspersed they were practically unnoticeable. Under the perch sat an absolute mountain of matchstick fries. While I like a hearty portion, this was almost out of control. The fries were hot (again, not scalding like I prefer), but I would gladly have substituted a handful of the overly salted potatoes for another couple perch fillets.One place you are always going to score highly with MFF is if you serve rye bread with your Fish Fry, and the Old Fashioned does. I dont particularly like rye, but since it is the traditional choice I give credit where credit is due. The OF rye is toasted, complete with grill marks that may, or may not, be genuine. Either way it is rye, which is excellent. The homemade poppyseed slaw that came along for the journey was also excellent and had a serious kick that many a good slaw is lacking. Oh, Old Fashioned, what is one to do with you? Such great atmosphere, but what has become of your Fish Fry? The once delicious fish is no longer so. In fact, it isn't even passable anymore. Overall, I can't recommend this Fish Fry, as it can no longer stand up as one of the best out there. How can this be? We once raved about your deliciousness and now can only say that your Fish Fry is adequate. Rather than running to you we are looking past you to Fish Frys reminiscent of what you once where.

The place has a great downtown location and in a few short years has become a local institution. For people visiting from out of town the Old Fashioned has become a Madison must. With a hefty crop of locals mixing with these out-of-towners it has gotten more and more difficult to actually get a table. On Friday night the crowd gets exacerbated to the point where the wait can be almost unbearable. Well, I had a friend celebrating a Wednesday birthday and figured that since they offer the same lake perch on Wednesday that they do on Friday it would be a good chance to have some and avoid the wait. Boy, was I wrong.Paul showed up about 6pm and put his group of 8 (of which I was 1) on the list. The hostess told him it would be around 45 minutes for a group of that size which seemed like a long time considering the traffic but we rolled with it. We grabbed some stools at the bar and waited the 45 minutes, never once hearing Pauls name. We continued to wait and eventually the hostess came and found Paul and our group, 1.5 hours later. Needless to say it was a long wait but I figured the service would be lightning quick and help make up for the wait. Boy, was I wrong again.  There were 4 Fish Fry eaters at the table and when the perch came, 20 minutes or so after ordering, all 4 orders were lukewarm to cold. The fish, as always, tasted good. It has a spicy batter which hints at KFC-like deliciousness but unfortunately since it was bordering on being cold the true flavors did not come through. Even the caper-laden, but still delicious, tartar couldnt help. By the time I got to my last of 3 butterflies it was cold-cold and I couldnt even finish it. I wept a little on the inside. The shoestring fries are also usually above reproach, but like the fish clearly sat for a while on this visit. They got a little soggy rather than being the crisp, salty delights that I have come to expect. Even the toasted slices of rye were cold and somewhat soggy. I was more than a little let down since I like my Fish Fry scalding hot right from the fryer and needless to say, this was not.All in all I havent really been looking forward to this review. I know the Old Fashioned has a great Fish Fry but this time they simply dropped the ball. I have to assume some, if not most, of the blame has to fall on the wait staff. I can understand having to wait for a table, even if an hour and a half is a little ridiculous but there is simply no excuse for serving lukewarm Fish Fry.Overall the Old Fashioned still has one of the best Fish Fries in town but consistency counts and this visit was simply not up to snuff. We basically have no choice but to drop them from our top 10 Fish Fries. The food is great (usually) but if they cant figure out a way to get people in and out a little quicker we are going to have a very hard time justifying going back on a Friday when it gets really busy.www.theoldfashioned.com23 N.

Out of the five Fish Fry eaters at our table two went for the Cod and three (myself included) went for the Perch. The 6-8 fillets of Perch were phenomenal as they usually are. They were lightly breaded with a delicious batter which had a very KFC style blend of spices. The Perch itself was light and delicious and not greasy at all. I also managed to get a bite or two of the Cod which was almost as good. It had a dark, slightly crispy batter which I thought would be very potent but was surprisingly light. The Cod itself was fairly rich and had a wonderful texture. Both styles of fish were great but I would still lean towards the Perch when given the option. The French fries were “matchstick” style, delicious and plentiful. The tartar sauce was also pretty good despite the fact that their website clearly says it has capers in it, which I hate. The capers and whatever else was in it were undistinguishable and all that came through was a good overall flavor. The bread served was toasted rye which is very traditional and was actually pretty tasty. The coleslaw that came along for the ride was actually very good as well and most people finished their respective portions. Overall the only drawback to The Old Fashioned is the wait, but on a Friday night it is kind of expected.

It is more difficult is to find the niche places that serve great fish to a discrete group of locals who don’t say peep about it because they don’t want the massive Friday crowds invading their space. Places like The Utica Bar or the Windsor Country Club can fly under the radar for years this way. Another local establishment that seems to have gone (relatively) undetected is Rossario’s in Monona. I have never heard Rossario’s mentioned as having a great Fish Fry. I have heard they serve up some of the best Italian cuisine in the area but never anything positive about their Friday night special. With this in mind we showed up not knowing what to expect and were more than pleased with what we found. Unfortunately the evening started out slow. We arrived and got the 30-35 minute wait routine. Well,  a couple Spotted Cow’s and bout an hour later the place had almost cleared out and a table was open for us. Needless to say the longer than expected wait had us slightly perturbed and very hungry.Our waitress came and we were ready for her since we had ample time to look over the menu during our wait. There are four fish options on Fridays, two deep fried and two grilled. Walleye and Cod are the delicious deep fried choices and the wussier grilled options consist of Rainbow Trout and Grouper. Needless to say we went for one Cod and one Walleye, both were delicious.  Both fish enjoyed the same light, herb-infused batter which was marvelous. It complimented both kinds of fish well but I thought it worked particularity well the Walleye.The French fries were thin and straight cut and were also spectacular. We also got to try some Yukon Potato Nuggets (or something like that) which were also great. Superb potato options for an Italian joint.  The tartar sauce was also right on the money and was served in a huge portion which no one person should dare to consume in one sitting. Simply awesome. The bread at Rossario’s was also well above average. It was a nice sized chunk of an Italian loaf served on a cutting board with a knife to cut it yourself and our waitress had no problem bringing us a second one after we devoured the first. One element that didn’t really shine was the coleslaw. It just wasn’t tasty, not that coleslaw usually is mind you.If the Fish Fry at Rossario’s was this good I can only imagine what the pasta and other Italian dishes are like.

It is more difficult is to find the niche places that serve great fish to a discrete group of locals who don’t say peep about it because they don’t want the massive Friday crowds invading their space. Places like The Utica Bar or the Windsor Country Club can fly under the radar for years this way. Another local establishment that seems to have gone (relatively) undetected is Rossario’s in Monona. I have never heard Rossario’s mentioned as having a great Fish Fry. I have heard they serve up some of the best Italian cuisine in the area but never anything positive about their Friday night special. With this in mind we showed up not knowing what to expect and were more than pleased with what we found. Unfortunately the evening started out slow. We arrived and got the 30-35 minute wait routine. Well,  a couple Spotted Cow’s and bout an hour later the place had almost cleared out and a table was open for us. Needless to say the longer than expected wait had us slightly perturbed and very hungry.Our waitress came and we were ready for her since we had ample time to look over the menu during our wait. There are four fish options on Fridays, two deep fried and two grilled. Walleye and Cod are the delicious deep fried choices and the wussier grilled options consist of Rainbow Trout and Grouper. Needless to say we went for one Cod and one Walleye, both were delicious.  Both fish enjoyed the same light, herb-infused batter which was marvelous. It complimented both kinds of fish well but I thought it worked particularity well the Walleye.The French fries were thin and straight cut and were also spectacular. We also got to try some Yukon Potato Nuggets (or something like that) which were also great. Superb potato options for an Italian joint.  The tartar sauce was also right on the money and was served in a huge portion which no one person should dare to consume in one sitting. Simply awesome. The bread at Rossario’s was also well above average. It was a nice sized chunk of an Italian loaf served on a cutting board with a knife to cut it yourself and our waitress had no problem bringing us a second one after we devoured the first. One element that didn’t really shine was the coleslaw. It just wasn’t tasty, not that coleslaw usually is mind you.If the Fish Fry at Rossario’s was this good I can only imagine what the pasta and other Italian dishes are like.

The service was good, the atmosphere was cool, and we liked pretty much everything we had. When we came back in 2011, everything was a little off and a little less great.Back in 09 Christys Fish Fry cost $11. In 2011 it still costs $11, but instead of three large hunks, you only get two average sized pieces.The cod in 09 was delicate and delicious. In 11 it was just okay as the once light and flaky beer batter was much thicker.  It was overly crispy and hid a soft, mushy under side. It still had a good flavor, but withheld some excess grease which compromised the flakiness of the underlying fish. Rather than a distinct fish/batter division, a strange convergence zone appeared between them resulting in a sort of gooey membrane. In 09 I chose curly fries, which turned out to be a mistake. In 20011 I recalled the folly and instead picked the battered French fries which were much better. They came in a large portion and were fried to a perfect crispness. I also got my hands on a few of the homemade chips which were fine, but a little over-fried for my taste. Of the three tater options the battered fries were the clear winner.Carrying over its excellence from year to year was Christys super thick, homemade tartar. The superb sauce bolstered the rotation with lots of mayo and just the right blend of relish. When presented with the soup/salad/slaw option in 09 I selected the salad and was unimpressed. In 11 a wiser me chose the slaw, and could not have been happier. The slaw, which came before the fish, was clearly homemade and had a uniquely delicious flavor. It was creamy and enticing and really kept me coming back for more.  The rolls rolled over from 09 to 11 and were well above average. These are not the standard tear-off dinner roll, but real individual buns. The basket housed two different kinds: one pumpernickel-rye and the other a plain white. The pump-rye was especially desirable. In 2009 the service was pretty good, and the adequacy carried over into 2011. While she was sporadic, our young waitress was reasonably quick about everything and even apologized for her one major lax is service by comping us a rather expensive strawberry margarita.Overall, we dont recommend this Fish Fry as highly was we once did, and while we may come back again at some point, wont be chomping at the bit to do so.

I assume it is called that because someone named Christy “landed” there at some point in time, but can’t be sure. I had heard a lot of mixed reviews about the bar/restaurant; some people said it was a comfy little bar with great food while others claimed to have had bad experiences. Usually when this is the case it is real crap shoot which is probably part of the reason I had put off going there for so long. After finally taking the leap, I am glad we did because Christy’s definitely treated us right.We arrived about 8:00 and didn’t have any trouble getting a spot which was kind of strange with it being Lent and all. When we got inside the place wasn’t real busy but the hostess said it would be about a 5 minute wait so we grabbed some drinks at the bar. I only got to watch the Badger hockey game for a few minutes on their absolutely massive projector screen before the table was ready and we headed upstairs to the dining area. On Friday’s Christy’s offers up a nice selection of fish including bluegill, walleye, beer battered lake perch and cod. I was planning on cod so that is what I went with and I am glad I did.The beer battered cod was very good. Often times beer batter gets very thick and crispy and completely masks the fish. The batter at Christy’s Landing was not like that at all, it was very light and flaky and let the fish come through. The three generous pieces of cod were also just about right for the $11 price tag. I was given an option of curly or regular fries and for some reason chose curly. They were okay but curly fries always seem to get cold so quick that by the end they just don’t taste fresh anymore. That was my bad, next time I will be getting regular fries for sure. What really put the fish over the top was the tartar sauce however. It was super thick and creamy without a sign of dill for miles, it was damn near perfect. Needless to say I was satisfied.The dining area of Christy’s Landing is somewhat Supper Club-y and comes with some of the things you would expect at a Supper Club like a nice little basket of rolls. In true Supper Club form they also offer a soup/salad/coleslaw option of which I chose a salad which was fine but uninspired. The service was also very good partially because it was later and we were one of the few remaining groups eating at that time.Overall this was one great Fish Fry. Christy’s put my fears to rest and I would have no qualms about going back or recommending their fried cod to a friend. Christy’s Landing has a great lakeside location and great food to match. I am really surprised they were not busier, but maybe that is just a sign of the times? Hey, I’ll take it as long as I can get it. Great Fish Fry without having to wait forever, that is bliss.www.christyslanding.net/2952 Waubesa AvenueMadison, WI(608) 249-1000",2903,0.1400663544106167,0.5693416101202986

I haven’t eaten there all that many times and the few times I have it has been on Taco Tuesdays. Each time I have left less than impressed, even if it was dirt cheap. I had always wanted to try a real meal here and heard about the Fish Fry but was always scared it would be quick and dirty, like their tacos. Well, we had an event to attend downtown and rather than go somewhere out of the way I put the CBI on the chopping block.We arrived a little before 8pm and had no trouble getting one of the few tables in the dining area. We ordered our beers, because what else would you get at the CBI, and looked over the menu quickly. On Fridays the CBI has cod for $10 and lake perch for a dollar more. I went for the perch and Gabe got the cod to give us a chance to compare the two. The perch was served as 8 teeny tiny filets which were hot enough but just average tasting. They were okay but when filets get this small they tend to dry out rather than stay limp and juicy and that is what happened here. The three fair sized pieces of cod were better and had a similar light batter. Both were marginally recommendable but the cod was certainly the better of the two.The French fries were straight cut potatoes fried to a golden crisp which made them absolutely delicious. In addition, the heavily “mayonized” blend of tartar sauce that worked well with the fish also did a fine job in helping mop up the remaining fries. Before we got the fish we were treated to a soup/salad option as a substitute for coleslaw. I went for a salad which was fairly basic but just fine. I also got some mixed sautéed vegetables with my perch which was strangely absent from Gabe’s cod plate. They were also just fine but I would have given them up to get my hands on some kind of bread of which there was none. Oh well.Overall the CBI exceeded the small expectations I had placed on it. The service in the restaurant area was actually pretty good as was the food. The menu actually has some variety which is really more than I expected since I think of the CBI first and foremost as a bar, not a restaurant. I think I can recommend this as a “if you happen to be there on Friday…” kind of Fish Fry.

We knew it was okay, but nowhere near the best, and we knew that the bar would be busy, but nowhere near the busiest. Turns out we were pretty much right on all counts.We showed up around 7:00, and found a few open booths awaiting our arrival. The $12.00 3-piece cod was featured on the chalkboard when we walked in so when the waitress came over it was just a simple matter of ordering the special and a Spotted Cow. The food came quickly after that and looked cute all cuddled up in its miniature wicker basket. The Spotted Cow beer batter seemed more like it was breaded than battered, but couldve potentially dipped in Spotted Cow then breaded? It was tough to tell. The three pieces were on the smallish side as a whole with only one of the three actually being normal sized. It was probably only around 5 oz of fish total and since it was light and flaky felt like even less. The breading was good, and had enough spice to cover some of the flaws in the fish but wasnt enough to fix it altogether. The fries were much more plentiful than the fish and decidedly tastier.  They were well-fried, skin-on numbers, and while they werent cut in-house they were still commendable. The tartar was also laudable but could have been thicker. It has a notable dill-relish essence which didnt help the fish, but didnt necessarily hurt it either. What did hurt this Fish Fry was the total lack of bread which is unfortunate since the coleslaw pulled its weight. The slaw was a super creamy blend with a ton of zip (some would say too much though we thought it was really good). While seven years might seem like a long time, it was a justified hiatus when talking about the Friday special at the Brass Ring. It was a good, solid Fish Fry, but nothing special, and probably not worth the $12. Overall, we dont recommend this Fish Fry and dont see ourselves coming back for it any time soon or in another seven years. www.thebrassringmadison.com701 E.

In fact, before this visit to Lake Windsor wed never even had the privilege to swing a club (save for a putter or two on a mini-golf course here or there). So, you can just about imagine how we fared when we hit the real links  lets just say it wasnt necessarily the prettiest thing youve ever seen. Fortunately, once our nine was out of the way, we were mercifully allowed to retire to the clubhouse for a round of a different sort  a round of beers and a Fish Fry. Now thats my kinda game.There have been some changes to what was once labeled The Pinnacle Room and instead of sitting in the 80s-glitzy dining hall of yore, we had a high-top table in what appeared to be the recently refurbished bar area. A very friendly young waitress came right over with some menus and sped off to get us the round we were after. When she returned with the brews we ordered our fish (the featured $12 beer battered cod) and sat for a minute to reflect on the finer points of golf. A minute or so was all it really took Almost instantly a funnel full of breadsticks arrived, complete with a side of sweet honey butter. The savory sticks come with all the items on the Friday menu and were actually quite good. They laid a solid foundation for the fish and bridged the gap from our woeful golfing game quite nicely. The sticks were followed by our coleslaw/salad/soup choice, of which I sampled the slaw. The homemade concoction was bountiful (a whole soup cup full), and housed a serious punch (much better than mine off the tee unfortunately).The fish came soon after and was freshly fried and literally scalding hot. The three large beer battered pieces were a departure from the breaded beauties of yesteryear, but still very good. They were practically grease-free which was somewhat surprising since the batter was fairly substantial. The crust had a nice flavor but in the end was nothing truly memorable (kinda like my golf game). The fish itself was fall-apart flaky, clearly quality, and as hot as any fish I can ever remember eating. An abundance of shoestring-style fries played caddy to the cod and did so admirably. They gleefully jockeyed the fish around with a plethora of salty goodness and gentle support. The tartar also chipped in, lending its pep to the fish in any way it could. Its thickness counterbalanced the substantial fish, keeping everything on par thanks to some serious zest. Amazingly, throughout our entire ugly round we never once found the bunker (water hazards being a different story). Likewise, the Fish Fry at the Lake Windsor Golf Clubs Bar and Grill somehow found all the fairways, and avoided the rough all together. While the course has changed a little bit since we last played it, it is still right up there with the legends of the game and very satisfying. Overall, we had a great time at Lake Windsor and have no qualms about recommending this Fish Fry (or the golf course for that matter). www.lakewindsor.com4628 Golf RoadWindsor, WI 53598     (608) 846-4711",3077,0.15668014375561545,0.5491509433962263

Weve never tried it before. Now I know why.The Vintage is famous for having one of the best patios in Madison, but apparently not one of the best Fish Frys. Cool Dadio hit the campus connection a few weeks ago, and after his mildly favorable review I knew we had to take our turn. I had a sneaking suspicion that this was not going to be a great Fish Fry based on the fact that CDs review focused primarily on the scantly-clad co-eds rather than the batter-clad fish, but I held out high hopes regardless. We were lucky enough to procure a spot on the densely packed patio, and within three minutes one of the waitresses came right over. She was clearly expecting that we were there for the drink special as she neglected the menus and came over with only tats intact. We requested some menus, and she returned seconds later with them only to hurry away again to grab the drinks we ordered. When she returned with the booze, she took our food orders and quickly disappeared yet again, leaving us to the hustle and bustle of University Ave. The food was ready in no time and served nice and hot as you would hope it would be.The fish-n-chips goes for $8.50 and is on the menu every day, so you know the fish isnt hand battered. The four long cod fingers tasted fine, but were clearly a high-quality Sysco-style product  not bad, but not fresh, and not a Fish Fry. The well-travelled fish was burdened with a medium-thick batter which was quite crispy. The fish was a little oily, but did maintain some flakiness despite its purported extended freezer life. Making the fish palatable was some Vintage tartar which was likely also Sysco, but still delicious - Sysco knows their tartar, you see. Every drop of the sauce was necessary as it gave the plain fish a little zip. The large portion of waffle fries also did all they could to make the meal. I queried the waitress as to which spud I should choose beforehand, and she suggested the waffle version over the regular rendition, so I gotta give her props on that one. She was good, and made all the right suggestions, even though there wasnt a whole lot of wiggle room when it came to the vegetarian options. Still, she was right on. Of course, fish-n-chips equals no bread, so after the fish, fries and tartar the only thing left was the crazy Vintage coleslaw. This unique take on the classic was basically just some raw cabbage with a fiery chipotle sauce drizzled on it. While the sauce didnt coat every bit of cabbage there was enough there to keep things interesting, and at least make it edible.  Cool Dadio is a man who clearly loves his fish, but he is also a man who loves his women. In his mind, the cute co-eds were more than enough to put this Fish Fry over the top. However, we feel the need to be a bit more objective. Sure, scantily-clad co-eds are nice, but when Fish Fry is the subject of the day, the fish must take precedence. I mean, does my grandma really care how cute the chicks working at the bar are? I would certainly hope not She cares about good fish at a good price, and unfortunately, on this front, the Vintage just doesnt deliver.
